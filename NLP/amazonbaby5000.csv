I think it is more Expensive than drugstore that only cost 27usd.so  you have a good chose if you want to but it,0
"When I saw this on Amazon, I put it into my wish list so I would be able to find it again.  I knew it would be the next baby gift I would purchase.  The opportunity recently came up and as soon as I read the shower invitstion, I placed my order.  This looks so comfortable.  I love that it has a second cover that allows it to grow with the child.  So many items designed for a baby are only used for such a short time, but this should be able to be used for much longer.  I have given this to the mother-to-be and she was thrilled to receive it.  The 7 year old had to try it out, already making plans on how she and the new baby can share it to watch TV!  There is a strsp on the bottom that makes moving it from room to room easy.  The cover zips off, to change to the other one, or to wash it.  It is a well thought out item.",1
"We really like these valances.  They have such cute characters on them.  We highly recommend them!  The only downfall is having to iron them after they come out of the dryer, but it's worth it!",1
No light emits from the night light. They painted it a solid color and didnt leave an opening in the back.  You will end up returning it.,0
"I was really hoping for this to be a conventient travel wipe dispenser, but it just didn't for for me. It doesn't close all the way. So it dries out the wipes =/",0
My two year old son loves this bookshelf!! We have filled it with about 25 books and still room for a few more. It looks great in our family room and we have received many compliments. Would highly recommend!,1
This light was wonderful for the first few days-before it started flashing like a strobe light.  We called Mobi and they immediately sent us another light free of charge but the new light only lasted for about 2 months and then would not turn on.  Also-green was the only color that wasn't too bright for our daughter's room at night.,0
I was mailed the wrong product when I ordered it and received a Deglingos blankie. Then I finally got the right product and it was as cute as in the picture. I shook it and it did jack squat.  I had no idea how to get it to rattle until my girl choked it and made it squeak.,0
"Great for Apartment or close quarters living! Mattress is a little thin and it isn't strong enough to hold its form with sheets (the elastic pulls the mattress so that it doesn't snuggly fit the sides of the crib. Very beautiful and somewhat easy to assemble, however, it either takes an amazingly flexable person or a second person as you assemble the short sides to the mattress support then attatch the long sides and its impossible to hold straight to screw one side on while the other side isnt attatched and ""flopping"" around. As far as durability, its pretty dang sturdy! My 6 and 4 year olds (being the big brothers that they are) have ""tested"" it to make sure it wont fall on the baby by jumping in it repeatedly and it hasn't even cracked with their combined weight (103 lbs total). The only down thing I have found with it is that the prescrewed holes for assembly dont stop and you have to check to make sure your not coming out the finished side.",1
I used these bibs on my older child and loved them. I am happy to use them on my twin boys.,1
Good price and good quality. I like that the cap keeps the nipple opening closed so I can mix formula in it (can't do that with medela nipples - need solid lids for that),1
"I love how cute this plate is, and the sections are nice, but the suction (even when you wet it) is only fair.  My daughter (17 mo old now) has been able to pull it off since getting it 3 months ago.  But I think no suction would be strong enough for a determined child who wants to pull her plate off of her tray.",1
"Bought this for my daughter, This had made being a mom to two young children a little bit easier.  I will buy this item again when my daughter in laws and my other daughter have babies",1
We bought this toys when our son's 15 months but he never really paid any attention to it until he was almost 20months when we bought him to the park with a huge sandpit. But now its mainly used in the tub as he loves to fill the cups up and see it drains. Never been using it as a stacking toy as he has so many other but I can see him making a stack with these. Cheap and good.,1
"My daughter's nursery is decorated with an owl theme.  After searching, I could not find a crib bedding set that I liked.  Instead, I opted for this toddler set and I'm so happy I did.  It is good quality, adorable, and it will last for years- not just a few months like a crib set.  We also have some of the matching accessories and get tons of compliments on the entire set.  Definitely happy with this purchase!",1
"These pacifiers are just fine and I have no big complaints. I bought them because they come with the sterilizing cover, but I've since learned that soap and water are perfectly fine for sterilizing as long as you don't use well water. So I never use the cover to sterilize anymore, just to cover it and keep it clean. So it would be more useful if there were a cover for each pacifier. Also, my baby has fat cheeks, and these pacifiers are pretty wide, so they press into his cheeks. He doesn't seem to mind it, but it does make them a little harder to keep in his mouth and he gets these awful looking red marks on his cheeks from them. So I prefer all of his other pacifiers to these ones. But these are pretty OK, too.",0
"We bought two of these, one for the nursery and one for the kitchen. It fits our Dr. Browns wide bottles perfectly. It isn't too loud. Seems to warm the bottles in a reasonable amount of time. I'm not sure what the people who are complaining about the time expect from a water-warmer. It isn't a microwave!",1
We travel a bunch and got this for the grand baby! It is perfect and easy to use! We love it and will use it for many years to come!,1
"I don't like because is poor quality. I never use, after first wash. I thought it was better quality, as Carters always has good products",0
Great bag with lot's of space for all my son's food. Keeps the food cool with an ice pack. Clip on the top means it easy to attach to a stroller or larger bag. Fun design gets compliments.,1
I purchased these at the same time I purchased my Boba so I put them on before I tried the carrier out on my baby for the first time. The second I put him in the carrier he started chewing on these teething pads. If I hadn't put them on he would have been chewing directly on the carrier. The carrier instructions say not to put it directly in the washing machine so I feel much better knowing that he was chewing on the pads (which I washed first in baby detergent). Plus I bought a few extra sets so if he is in the carrier for a long period of time and gets the pads really wet I can easily change them out. I would say these are a must have for your baby carrier while your baby is teething or for babies who just like to chew.,1
I received the product very quickly and it looked great! I'm very happy with the product and would recommend it!,1
"Being a new mom, I had been using blankets and worrying whether my baby was warm when we went out.  I observed other moms with this and went to Babies R Us and found it.  It is so easy to use and functional.  I live in a very cold area and this garment keeps my daughter very warm.  Sometimes when it is snowing I tuck a blanket around her as an extra precaution.  Regardless of whether I use the extra blanket her toes and fingers stay warm and she sleeps very soundly.  I highly recommend it.",1
Great price and great quality.  Picks up the sound and absolutely no white noise.  The two way radio thing is pretty cool too.,1
"We have had this stroller for 2 years. I power walk with it 5 miles a day, 5 days a week year round (except snow/ice) so it gets a lot of use. My children are now almost 4 (35 lbs) and almost 2 (25 lbs). We have been using it since my 23 month old was born with her chicco infant carrier. I am so happy with the durability of the stroller for the price that I paid. I would recommend it to anyone. It has been on several airplane trips (I always detach the front canopy and pack it in our large suitcase) and it has been used everywhere from Disney World to the North Carolina Beaches to the mountains of Utah. I have had not problems with any parts not meeting my standards and at 5 miles a day, I feel that I am putting it to the test. We use two JJ cole bundle bags and a double tandem stroller weather shield in the cold and rain. I purchased the weather shield from one step ahead. It does not fit perfectly, but does the trick unless it is really pouring. Hope the accessories are helpful for anyone looking. I highly recommend this stroller!",1
Great service what expected to be love this product Great serviceGreat service Great service Great service. Great service. Great service,1
My soon to be 4-year old wanted Spiderman wall decays because his twin sister had Princess Tiana decays on her wall.  His was so excited that him and his sister proceded to open the package and rush to his room to put up the decays.  They peeled them off and placed them on the walls themselves.  So now his room has his own personal touch.,1
"Tried many different seats to potty train my son.  This has been the best.  The splash guard is great and the seat is soft.  My son likes to play with the race button on the handle.  Also easy to clean.  As he got older, we removed the splash guard to ease him onto a regular seat.",1
"Easy to clean, move and use. Love that it cleans so easy.  Washed the cover and it came out looking like the first day I purchased it.We have two little grandchildren, 9 months and 2 years.  It works for both of them.  I love this high chair.",1
"This is a great product at a really,really great price! I plan on buying another one. Love it! It's made very well.",1
"I gifted this product to one of my friend's, she loves it",1
I love mine and I always buy these as gifts for friends baby showers. I've used mine for 3 years now and it's held its shape and softness/firmness very well so far. The removable cover washes fine. I love this nursing pillow!,1
"This medical kit is very cheap. I tried using the dropper, and it was terrible. I threw everything away after realizing they were not worth keeping.",0
"Best Carrier.....my little one (16 months) is now 25lbs and I can carry her on my back no worries whilst grocery shopping and more. The padding and support is great. Also a life saver to keep her where I can see her, out of harms way so I can get on with it. Plus she loves the ride! =)Don't bother with the cheaper brands save up for this and use it from birth to.......2 years and beyond-definitely worth it.",1
"One of the best vibrating seats i found! Works well when they are an infant and now that my ten month old can hold her own bottle, its perfect to sit her in during bottle time. Its good up to 40lbs so it will be her chair for quite some time. A must have!",1
"I really like this piddle pad, its very soft and fits into the seat like it is part of it.  My daughter has not ""used"" it yet but the way it sits in the seat apears that it would hold the ""liquid"" very well.",1
"These bowls are a good weight and depth in pretty colors.  Perfect for snacks or cereal.  They are dishwasher-safe, but not microwaveable.  Great bowls!",1
"I watched this item for several months and hesitated ordering it because of the reviews stating that it was to small for Target shopping carts. In March 2012 I noticed some new colors were available so I decided to give it a try. When I received the box it had a sticker on it that read - """"New & Improved Larger Size."""" I brought it to Target and it fit the cart with plenty of room to spare. So far I'm very happy with it.I've posted photos of the box and the cover on a Target shopping cart in the customer photos section.",1
she is gettig ready to crawl and this would be a fun toy for her. i didn't like anything about it. i would recommend this toy for crawlers.,1
this pink owl pillow is so cute.. it is so soft and with a good size.. my daughter love it..,1
I really like it ! :) it looks nice.in my room ! I bought one for my sister and she loves it ! Seems she loves hello kitty. So I really recommended it !Yall should buy it !,1
"My twins were born at 35 weeks weighing in at 4 lbs. 7 oz. and 4 lbs. 10 oz.  After spending nine days in the hospital, we prepared to come home.  Unfortunately my smaller twin failed the mandatory car seat test.  I was devastated, but our hospital came to the rescue and let us borrow a bed car seat similar to this one.  We were allowed to leave that day as planned even though my baby weighed only 4 lbs. 2 oz. at our time of departure. I immediately bought this car seat online since we had several drs. appointments we had to go to. This truly saved us and allowed us to travel without worrying that our little one's breathing would be compromised.After a month, our baby passed the car seat test and we were able to switch to a regular seat.  It was a good thing because our baby was already growing too big for this seat.  Glad to have it for the time we needed it.",1
This was washed twice with fabric softener both times before even attempting to put on bed and it is still a really rough texture. I would not sleep on this myself. Terrible product by Carter's. Very disappointing. I suppose I can use this for cleaning the garage instead.,0
Well worth the price.  This is very durable.  My little guy had 8 teeth by the time he was 7 months and has gnawed on this thing like you wouldn't believe.  It is in the same great condition as when we got it.  The legs of the giraffe allow little ones to localize teething more efficiently.,1
"The second time I wanted to use the tent, I was setting it up and the pole snapped.  The poles are made of cheap plastic, so I wouldn't recommend purchasing this item lest your tent encounters the same fate.It is also virtually impossible to get the tent back into the stuff sack after the first use.",0
"This toy is made like a rag doll. The sewn seams are exposed. The fabrics used are dull, not bright like most new toys. It does appear well put together; the ears and tail and other protrusions won't come off easily. There's a barely reflective circular disc on the belly of the doll that will show changes in the color of objects passed in front of it and not much else. There's a small wooden ring  and a small plastic shape attached below the barely reflective disc.  A baby may become attached to this toy because of  all the different places it can be grabbed. It doesn't look anything like a giraffe.  The blue things on the top of the head don't look anything like giraffe horns.",1
"My son loves being able to use this. It's easy for him to move around the kitchen to watch me while I'm cooking. I used it once (hoping I wouldn't break it) and it seems to hold 250 lbs. well. Granted, I wasn't jumping on it or anything, but it held up and didn't break. Woo! :)",1
This bag has 3 full size outside pockets as well as the bottle holders on the sides.  Inside it has 2 smaller pockets so it's not so much of a 'black hole'.  Fairly durable and comes with wipe holder and changing pad.,1
"These were the first table-toppers I purchased and I loved that they helped contain messes and also kept my little one from eating food off of a table. But, I soon encountered a better solutions... there are other table toppers that are biodegradeable (the Pooh ones are plastic). The other brand also is mostly black and white, and my my older kiddo enjoys coloring on them. Overall these type of products are great for early self feeders, but I prefer the ones that will biodegrade.",0
Nice mirror for the gym or crib plus can hang with the velcro very colorful. like the way you can position it in serval ways.,1
I received this car seat as a gift and we just loved it! We found that it grew with our daughter very nicely and we were a bit sad that she eventually outgrew it completely after a year. This car seat is simple to install and use. It is well made and really handled being used and abused without any problems. We ended up buying two more bases so that both my husband and I had one as well as our daughter's babysitter. The babysitter was able to squeeze this car seat into her SUV in between her two kids car seats with no problems at all. I would definitely recommend this car seat! I just felt like my precious little package was wrapped up snug and safe in this seat!,1
"This was a gift for a friend with a new baby.  It's cute, soft, useable and loveable.  What's not to like about it?",1
"Great infant car seat. I had the same car seat for my daughter, and bought another one for my brother's son. It is comfortable, easy to use and light weight",1
Came with missing pieces and some of the piece or broken. Do not buy it.now don't know what to do.,0
It'll get its first trial this weekend ! Our 2 year old grandaughter will be visiting from Manhattan and she'll be sleeping inour guest bedroom'!  Seems like it could be a little taller!,0
"At first I loved this bag. The colors and style were very appealing. However I used this bag only a couple of times before the zipper gave out. I never overloaded the bag or pushed it's limits. It was just poorly constructed material and didn't meet up to my expectations in the least. I have had cheap diapers bags from Walmart last longer than this. Long story short, I ended up investing in a Petunia Pickle bag instead. Disappointed doesn't even begin to cut it. Save your money.",0
Purchased a second one for my second child. Great modern look and doesn't take over the whole room. highly recommend,1
"If you want to use this for 2 kids, with another monitor- don't buy it. If you are considering buying a second camera for two kids, think about my comments below.Here is why I like it:This monitor scans for ten seconds between my two kids. (I have two cameras.)The monitor shows the temperature. Didn't realize I was probably cooking my oldest until I started using this monitor.You can zoom in on your child to make sure he/she is breathing. (I do this. ;)Here is what I'm not sure about:You can play a lullaby or talk to your kid through the monitor. The lullaby and &#34;talking&#34; sounds like Darth Vader. It would probably scare my kid to death. Be your own judge.Here's what I don't like:It doesn't have much of a reach- in two different ways. 1. Unless the camera is only about a foot or two away from your child, the picture is grainy. This means you cannot mount the camera across the room. We do this for my older child who would mess with the cord if we put it right by his bed. 2. The monitor's signal does not reach across the house very well. I have to put the antenna up and it still cuts out every now and then. Our house is 3500 square feet. I'm on one end, the boys on the other. (I might be stretching the range, but just so you know.)The monitor interferes with WiFi like crazy and any other monitor you might have. We originally bought this monitor with one camera to use with our new baby and planned on using an older, Summertime monitor for our oldest. You CANNOT use the two monitors at the same time. Summertime goes strong and this one shuts down. So, we bought another camera for this one and it works fine- UNLESS you are trying to use the Internet. It will cut out when I'm using my laptop or we try to use Apple TV, Amazon Prime instant video, etc.",0
"Easy to set up but took me longer than the 5 minutes it says on the box (hubby probably could have done it faster). But now that it's put together it is very easy to install on the bed. We take these bed rails with us on road trips and just toss them in the van. They fit up to queen sized beds and are easy to adjust. Great for the price too, nothing more I could ask for!",1
"Beautiful storage hamper for games and toys, it fitted just right! It is so cute, and my child loved it as well.",1
"Every mom needs stroller straps to hang the diaper bag, purse or shopping bags. This is the best on the market because it closes completely! No-one is going to steal your bag! They are the only one the market where you can choose your color. Its better than the hooks in that with them your bag can fall off, get stolen easily and the hooks cant hold a bag with a wide strap. Karima Mohamed, EXPERT SHOPPER",1
"My 8 month old baby loves to stand up in this crib, chew on the edges and look around at everyone.  It's great that the fabric is washable and the zipper opening allows me to put her in more easily when she's already knocked out.  The soft sides are also safe for her head because she is always falling all over the place.  Compact, practical and definitely recommended :)",1
"It works well...but just as a storage basket. It's not sturdy enough to actually sit on but is definitely a space saver. Easy pop-out design and really simple, but useful product. Highly recommend as a storage basket, NOT a seat.",1
"These cups are terrible.  The valve is fine, but within a month, the spout on the lid frayed as my 13 month old rubbed her teeth against it while drinking.  Now you can brush plastic fibers off the spout without hardly trying.  I can't imagine what a child would injest as a result!  I won't be buying Munchkins again - stick with Playtex.  After 3 children, those are still working GREAT.",0
"Grandson has loved it ever since he could sit in a bath.  It lights up, moves, and sprays water upwards like a fountain.  Great little toy in the bathtub!",1
"This swing was a lifesaver for our household!The swing can be turned to rock forward & back,or side to side; so if the baby gets restless,you can offer them a completly different view with the push of a button.The little globe on top changes color as it turns,which proved to be facinating to my son.My son was born with severe acid reflux,and was unable to lay completly flat,especially after eating,so this swing also served as a cradle/bassinet for the first few months of his life.We both slept much sounder due to the aqurium swing and the soothing water sounds it makes(as sound as you can sleep with a newborn.)Although there is a slight mechanical sound as well,its not too bad.Last,I do recall that when we first got home,the swing seemed to go a little fast for an infant-we simply layed a rolled up recieving blanket over the blue swinging arm to weigh it down a bit,and it was perfect!",1
"This shield is much more comfortable (for bigger nipples) than the standard one the pump comes with, but there is no barrier/filter between the shield intake and the hose, so milk sprays often cause droplets to end up in the hose, decreasing the pump efficiency. also the hose is a little tricky to dry afterwards.",0
i am such a fan of aden and anais swaddle wraps. the fabric is lightweight yet keeps my baby super warm. i love that the wrap is so big unlike other swaddle wraps that are small.,1
"amazing product for the price! colors are more vibrant than the picture leads on, it's so cute! the comforter is a little on the thin side, but i don't really think a baby needs a super thick blanket.",1
This is amazing! I've been using it from 3 weeks on. Five minutes in this and my baby falls asleep. I can't shop without it. Strangers are always asking me about it. Moms with strollers wish they thought of it first. Supports baby's legs so no crotch issues and it's cloth so no rash.or chafing issues like with other carriers. It's so easy to use! You Tube videos are great for learning how. Maybe practice with a doll first so your baby doesn't fuss. I use all positions but hug & adventure are my baby's favorite.,1
I ordered this cover up for my daughter believing you could choose from the various colors. The one I got was BROWN! I was not pleased at all!BB,0
That's why I really bought it. I don't want to put water in a big bathtub for a 6 month old. Even when he was a newborn I put his mesh sling in there while I bathed him and it fit with no problems.,1
"This is a great stroller.  I researched many different strollers before deciding on this one.  This is a newer stroller so I wasn't able to find many reviews on it, when I did find one online it was always positive so I decided to get one.  I love the way it looks and it is a very comfortable ride for my daughter.  I have gotten many compliments on it when taking it on a walk. You can use it from the time they are a newborn because it almost fully reclines and it comes with a cozy footmuff that you can zip on to keep you little one warm.  It also comes with a bar you can clip on so you can click in your infant car seat.  I think it works with most infant car seat brands.  I have a combi tyro and it fits onto the bar.  I was told this was not a jogger but more of a all terrain stroller.  I don't run but like to take walks often and needed a stroller that did well on rough terrain like bumpy roads, the sand, grass, etc.  This stroller is great for that.  I love the way it handles, it is easy to maneuver because the front wheel swivels which is key.  You have the option to lock the front wheel as well.  It folds down easily and it not to heavy to lift and I'm pretty petite.  I would recommend this stroller to anyone.",1
"I am grandma and baby's parents requested this by name. Works very well, washes and wears well, easy to use.",1
"Bought this for our granddaughter when she occasionally travels with us. Very sturdy, yet lightweight and easy to use, quick to move in and out of our car. I added a foam pad under the seat pad that comes with it, to give her a little more cushion. She finds it very comfortable now.",1
My grandson just loves this teether. It is soft enough all the way around but still bumby enoungh to help with the teething.,1
"I bought Mortimer the Moose, in part because of all the great reviews for it.  So far, I haven't figured out why so many people love him so much.  At this stage in the game, my 5 month old is mostly interested in putting things in his mouth.  The problem with Mortimer is that he's so big, that my baby isn't able to hold on to him for very long.  And Mortimer's antlers are pretty big, so I think he has teething toys that work better for that purpose.  This is the only Lamaze toy we have, so I can't compare the moose to any of the other animals the company produces.I could see that maybe he'd like the moose better as he gets older, but I wouldn't recommend the moose for small babies.",0
"our baby didn't like it.  Its well made and functions as advertised.  See other reviews regarding assembly as it is a little weird.  We had some sleep issues with our baby and took the advice of many in getting a swing.  We researched everything to make sure our son would get some sleep in this swing.  No matter what we tried, he would start crying minutes after being put in the swing.  Not really a testament to this product, as I really wanted the swing to work.  We ended up returning it, which was no easy task, since it is a nightmare to get unassembled.",1
"My 18 month old son didn't even want to hold this thing, let alone suck fruit out of it. He drinks out of 20 different kid cups, feeds himself with a spoon/fork, eats every brand of mash-ups, squeezable fruit, smoothies, etc on the market but he wouldn't touch this thing. Not sure why, but just didn't work for us at all.",0
This bottle was perfect for our little one.  She wasn't a burper and this bottle helped a lot with her spit up.  We tried Avent and Evenflow bottle and they just weren't as good.  Only troubling part was all the parts that came with it.  The bottle consistes of 5 different parts so when you was dishes you need to make sure you have all the parts before emptying the sink.,1
Bought this for my son who is 8 months old. He is in the 90th percentile for height and is still too short to use this product. I wish I would have read the other reviews before I bought this. I don't know why they would design a walker that sits so high off of the ground at the lowest setting. The box says that it is for 4 months or older. USELESS!,0
My Baby LOVES this! It was a great buy!,1
"I bought this for my baby's nursery, as I wanted something "" cartoon free"" and more like a princess theme. Her room looks just as expected. And just as the picture. Totally love it",1
"The Cosco Fruity Jungle Play Yard does not have ample padding in the bottom play area to protect babies from head injuries when they fall backward.  This is the third Cosco produce that I have bought or have been given for my grandson and ALL were returned for basically the same reason.  This product line is less expensive than most others , which is probably why people buy it.  But it is not provide piece of mind that it is safe.  When my grandson fell backwards in the play yard and his head made a sound that echoed throughout the room, I knew that this was not something that I would be keeping.He is only five months old but is very active, pulling himself up by holding on to the  rails of his crib and trying to stand up in the play yard.  I am looking for one that has more padding and that I feel is safer in guarding against head  and other injuries.If you are looking for a play yard.......do not buy this one.",0
Great comfort - eats batteries but we knew that going in. Go ahead and buy the corresponding batteries as you will go through one ever 2 weeks. Ends up costing about 10 dollars a month to operate but that is worth the improve in sleep/piece of mind.,1
The bag looks good and even better in real. We are using it for all our outing with the kid and it fit nicely his extra cloths and snacks.,1
"We have had this monitor for about 3 months now.  We love it!  It is sensitive to pick up pretty much as much sound as you'd like.  The video is incredible.  Even in a completely dark room, we can see our little one clear.  I'm not sure what the other reviewers are speaking about when they're describing the flashing LED's.  We don't see any of this.  They just stay on with a very dull orange appearance.  The only negative (if you can say that) about the monitor is if you use the video a lot on just battery power, it drains them pretty quickly.  You need to use the video on/off button to take quick peeks and then you're fine.  Highly recommend this monitor!!!",1
"Got this for a larger fit that some of our smaller coolers.  With the medela icepack (labeled as ""for breastmilk storage"" I can fit 3-4 regular playtex bottles.  I can't always seal the top, but in that case I do snap the handles together and that keeps it faily well closed for the short trip to daycare. This bag has lasted 4 years for us and although we wish it was a little bigger - it seems every bigger bag too big.  We love it.",1
"My almost four-year-old son liked a lot, now a week later he used by him self, is a great product and I higly recomended, easy to use, easy to clean, no mess around the bathroom and now he fell like a big boy now he know how to use a urinal.",1
I purchased this for my 8 month old daughter so she would have a safe place to play.  I followed the other people's advice and ordered 2 units instead of 1 with extensions.  It makes a large area and it is big enough for me and my husband to get in with her to play.  I especially like the fact that with 2 units there are 2 doors so you can have a door on both sides.,1
"We have had this mat for 4 months now. Our daughter has been using it since she could sit upright and she spends a lot of time on it since she has apparently decided to skip the whole crawling phase.We like this product because the foam is the right size, not too thick or too thin. She fell face down several times on this mat and did not hurt herself. She also fell back and bumped her head on it and despite the crying and all was not hurt either. So, it does the job. It is very easy to clean with soapy water. Easy to transport too which we did when we went away on a long vacation. Everything fits back in a small bag easily. The size of the mat is quite adequate too. We have seen mats in friends' houses that are way too big. To us it makes no sense to get big mats because either your baby does not crawl (like ours) and in this case this size is perfect, or your baby crawls and in this case he/she will definitively not stay confined on the mat :)Bad points: the paint does peel off after extensive use. It can be attenuated though by shuffling the mats around which is very easy. We have not seen any instances of that paint ending up on her hands or her clothes or anything such as suggested in other reviews. It seems to come off from rubbing against hard plastic toys and such.Another thing is that our daughter can sometimes reach the edge of the mat and is able to take the tiles off directly into her mouth of course.But all in all, it is a good product even if it is not very durable. We would recommend it only if you do not have the intention to keep it for a very long time.",0
It's not super high quality but it looks nice and for the price is a good buy.  Looks good in girls room,1
"We have a new baby boy that was born about a month ago. My wife and I have divided our duties and I'm the lucky chap who gets up at night and feeds him. She keeps a supply of breast milk in the fridge. Of course, I must warm up the milk and we purchased ""The First Years Quick Serve Bottle Warmer"" for that purpose. It's handy and easy to use, even in my sleep-deprived condition.I'm not totally satisfied with this product. First of all, the cap holder broke off the little measuring vile almost right from the start. There's no way to fix it. Oh well, fixing it isn't essential, but it gives me the feeling that this bottle warmer might be a cheap piece of junk. Secondly, the bottle warmer heats the milk too hot if the instructions are followed precisely. Experimenting a bit, I have found that if four ounces of milk are to be heated to the desired temperature in the bottle, then the little measuring vile for water (added to the warmer) should be filled only to three. Go figure. Once you get that little calibration problem worked out, everything seems to work satisfactorily. Using it is fairly quick and easy. Otherwise, the warmer is nice looking and easy to keep clean. Hopefully it will last as long as needed.Gary Peterson",1
"We got this stroller in anticipation of having 2+ children although we used the double attachment quite a bit even just with one child when we'd have other of her friends over for a playdate or such and could easily have a double stroller. The back seat is popular with the toddlers and can easily be taken on or off. We now have a 2nd child and are so grateful to have the double stroller that is so much more trim and compact than a double bob. We have had trouble with the wheels/rims (which other reviewers noted) but have had EXCELLENT customer service from phil and teds with them sending replacement wheels even after warranty had expired. We also have the travel bed and the travel high chair from phil and teds and have been so happy with all products. But, especially with the quick and excellent response we've gotten from customer service if anything has gone wrong when they have been quick to make it right.",1
I have had lots of pet nets as we called them but this is the best. Mainly because it is very large and can hold a lot of stuffed animals including the big ones,1
"This sleep sack is great! Soft and light, easy to get baby in and out of and makes diaper changes easy with the dual direction zipper!",1
Did not immobilize my LO enought for her liking. She likes to be swaddled tight. However I do use it for nap times but at night jave to use traditional swaddling techniques to get her wrapped tight.,1
This sling is the best! I have 2 of them and I use both all the time. I have been using it since my son was 3 months old. He is now 6 months old. I can put him in it in multiple positions and breast feed him in it when walking around. I get lots of compliments and people askng me where I got it. If its raining out I put him in the sling and the umbrella keeps us both dry and baby warm. I can't say enough good things about this sling.,1
"I usually use the take and toss cups and have never had a problem aside from possibly having a small drip from the spout after hours of it sitting upside down.  These leak everywhere through the twist on part.  My son complained about one of them not working and after checking it out I actually had to re-poke holes in the spout with a safety pin because they weren't done correctly.  Definitely not cheap enough for all of these issues, they are going into the recycle bin..even the ones we haven't used yet.",0
I ordered 2 of these gates and I am using one at my home and one at my son's apt. We are very happy with this gate since it doesn't mark the walls and is very secure. It is a great product and pretty easy to use.,1
"This is my fifth Britax car seat, and my second Britax Parkway SGL booster seat.  All of the seats are excellent quality and have the highest safety rating for car seats.  Britax has changed the positioning clip which the seat belt is directed through, and I have no issues with the seat belt getting stuck or not sliding smoothly through the clip.  The first Parkway SGL I bought about 8 months ago had the slot that the seat belt slides through in the center of the positioning clip, and like other reviewers have stated, the belt does sometimes get stuck or slip into that space when you are buckling or unbuckling your child.  We have that seat in my husband's truck, so it just gets occasional use.  The new Parkway has the slot in the back of the seat belt positioning clip, and I have had no issues with it.  Britax must have listened to it's customers.  I particularly like the LATCH.  The booster seat is held firmly in place, and this is great for getting in and out of the car as well as safety when the booster is not being used.  Contrary to what some reviewers have stated, the point of the LATCH is to hold the seat in place, this booster seat is not to be put tight into the car like a regular car seat with a harness. The seat is lightweight and easy to move from car to car.",1
"This is an easy to install gate. No drilling necessary, easy up, easy down. Solves the risk of little ones falling down the stairs.",1
"Baby gates are so expensive for a good quality gate...so when I found this one, I was skeptical because it was so cheap...but it's better quality than any others I've seen!!!! LOVE IT!!!!",1
"Could not keep my two year old out of the fridge and after he broke a jar on the floor it was time to do something.  After a brief search I found this latch and despite the negative reviews I ordered it.  Product arrived quickly, installation was a snap and I have had no problems with it coming loose.  Based on the negative reviews I chose to clean my fridge with acetone rather than the recommended method in the directions of using rubbing alcohol.  As a side note my fridge is white so I am not sure how this would do with stainless.",1
"I love how easy it is to put it in the car , very light one. Makes a perfect stroller with car seat.",1
"Like another reviewer said, it's a dumb block of foam...yes! However, I was able to install the Radian 100 with this ""dumb block of foam"" and have my passenger seat nearly all the way back in my 4 door 2012 Honda Civic! Easy to use and really effective. Pay the $10 and save yourself a few inches of space.",1
Con: it is a little small. It is about 27 inches long so my son gre out of sleeping in this fast. We got a Co-sleeper that he is using now. love having both items.Pro: It can sit up into a chair position. Even though my son is too big to sleep in it he still sits in it every day becasue in the sitting position the seat has more leg room.My son does not like the bouncing but if your kid does it works very well. I never used the mobile either.,1
Love these! so easy to use in a hurry which is important when little hands are trying to grab things!,1
This gate deserves a gold medal.  It was originally purchased to block off the kitchen from our 16 month terminator but proved its worthiness again as it keeps our new lab puppy in the kitchen.  It is also so user friendly. We are buying another one for the other end of the kitchen.  Don't waste your money on others!!!,1
We recieved this for a shower gift and it is by far our baby's biggest necessity! It has all the bells and whistles and I can say we use all of the features it comes with. The only thing I would change about the swing is to make the music last longer. It has such lovely soft music that lulls my baby to sleep! The cradle feature on the cradle swing makes our baby feel snug like she's in our arms. We LOVE this swing!!,1
"I'm exclusively breastfeeding so my doctor recommended I give my son Vitamin D drops.  These work great and he takes them without issue.  He opens his mouth like a little bird as soon as he sees the bottle :)My only complaint is how you administer it.  You are supposed to give one drop, but the bottle isn't very &#34;squeezable.&#34;  It's hard to get the drop to come out.  Hence the 4 stars.",1
"Need to find a faster system than filling with a spoon, but these work well.  Have to make sure they are expanded all the way before filling, otherwise you can't fit much in them.  Had a leak the first time I used them, cap wasn't on tight enough.  Good for the price.",1
"I am using this gate between my kitchen and dining room to stop the dog from going into the nice areas of our house.  I used to have an old baby gate there that looked really bad, so wanted to get something nicer.  This gate looks really nice and I am not embarrassed to leave it up when we have company.  It actually looks like it belongs there and I get compliments on it.Installation was quick but a little tricky.  If you don't have it lined up correctly or have it compressed the exact right amount, the door either catches too much or will not catch at all.  Getting it right took me adjusting and repositioning a few times, but I think the 48&#34; opening (the max size for the gate) that I was installing it in made it a little more difficult.  It also has some positioners that you can screw into the wall to hold it solidly in place instead of just relying on the compression to do so.",1
This is the second we have purchased we liked it so much the first time around. I really recommend it to help keep the records of your child organized.,1
I'm hoping I'll be able to use these when my baby is bigger (she's 6.5 mos now).  Her finger tips are too tiny for these now.  The Piyo Piyo scissors work much better.,0
"We bought a wubbanub for one of our daughters and loved it but it only works with the soothie pacifier. Plus the paci is sewn onto the wubbanub making cleaning a little cumbersome. This paci-plushie is absolutely adorable, fits many types of pacis, comes unattached for easy cleaning plus has a tiny rattle inside making it both a lovey and a toy. I'm so thankful we never have to look for a paci under the crib at 3am ever again-baby can find it herself!",1
"I love this blanket. I ordered it for my son who isn't here yet but will be arriving on the 9th. It is sooo soft and cozy, I'm really picky about fabrics but this blanket was well worth the price. cant wait to use it for my baby boy. good quality",1
"I absolutely love this car seat/carrier.When we brought her home from the hospital we used an additional headrest insert that someone had given us, and I would recommend using it until baby's head doesn't need as much support. My daughter is now almost 7 months old and weighed in at 17 lbs at he last appointment.It's fairly easy to move the straps & buckles too.This cart seat doesn't have any frills, but the handle & light weight are what I was looking for.The seat is so light, and the handle shape allows me to still carry her in this without much trouble.The additional bases are reasonable too so we have one in each car, and both grandparents have one too.I use the carrier with the Kolcraft Universal Cart and it is wonderful!",1
I purchased this for my daughter for her sons first b day. They loved it. It was perfect size for area from kitchen to basement. It was easy to set up and they love the bi-directional swing door.,1
"We bought this as a replacement pushchair when our original one was returned after 4 weeks. We actually made it up with nearly new and new parts. As many others have experienced, we too had problems with the front wheel locking up. However we ditched the wheel supplied with the pushchair and purchased an all terrain wheel - this was so much better and solved the problem.  I am glad we didn;t pay full price and don't have this as our main pushchair as I think I would have sold it by now (we also have an umbrella stroller). Going around the shops is a real pain; its far too wide and there is virtually no storage underneath. However, we use ours to go to local country parks and on walks - and for this the Buzz is absolutely brilliant.  If you can afford to buy a pushchair solely for one purpose, then I would recommend this one but if you want an all-rounder, look for something else.",0
"We recently purchased this booster to replace the Fold-Up Booster Seat that has gone to live at Grandma's. Since they are made by the same company, similarly priced, and this one has some added features, we decided to upgrade to this newer design. I am so glad we went with this one! Not only is it more compact than the other booster, it is easier to use. I love the retractable straps, as the straps on our other booster got lost, and we had to come up with new ones. Also, the tray attaches to the seat, so no more dropping it in the parking lot of the restaurant while carrying the booster, tray, diaper bag, and baby. The storage compartment is a little small, but it works fine for a few disposable bibs, and a sample-size package of wipes. They tray fits into the dishwasher, so no more scrubbing crusted food off the tray. I agree with other reviewers that the tray is a little snug, and probably won't fit a 4 year-old as the manufacturer recommends, but it fits my 2 year-old just fine with a little room to wiggle (and he's not a skinny toddler). I guess by the time he's 4, he'll be old enough to sit up to the table without the tray anyways.The only complaint I have about this seat is that it would be nice if the restraint straps were washable, but I guess they wouldn't be very secure if they came off the seat, so I can live with them the way they are. As long as you wipe them down with a washcloth or wipe before any food dries on them, they come pretty clean anyway. Other than that, I couldn't be happier with this booster. Just remember, you get what you pay for. This is an inexpensive, portable booster. If you want large, sturdy, and completely washable, buy a highchair! This is just an occasional substitute.",1
"I love the functionality and how cute it is, but regrettably it does not withstand a lot of wear.  The bottom plastic cover is coming loose and sort of traps water in it, and my daughter dropped it once without the lid which dented the top edge so now the lid is really hard to screw on and off. However, she loves it, and it keeps her lunch either warm or cold, and I would still recommend it.",1
"We've had this monitor for about 6 months and it has been absolutely fantastic. The video quality is great, I love that I can hook it up to the TV (have only done it once though - but it does have a picture in picture option which is fab. We just never use it because we were glued to watching her and didn't see the point in having a tv show on in the background ;-))The sound is great, and it works all throughout our house and even in our yard perfectly. The only thing off about it is the temperature display - it's about 10 degrees off. That doesn't really concern us that much, we just subtract 10 degrees from what it says.",1
"I went out of my way to register for the boutique versions of A&A's towels as the sets sold at Buy Buy Baby are very thin.  My daughter is now 5 weeks old and I am highly disappointed with these towels.  They leave white fuzz all over my baby!  They are not as thick as I would like them to be although the size and thickness is acceptable.  The only positive is that I do love the washcloths.  We ordered a bunch of these in Hide & Sea and La Mer.  They are so cute that I am sad to have to move on to another towel, especially considering how much was spent on them.  I plan on buying regular towels for baby to use since the towels the grown ups in the house use are thicker, softer and do not shed.  Love their blankets but their towels are a huge miss!",0
"I love this diaper pail. Yea, if you let poopy diapers sit in it for too long and don't change the bag on a regular basis it will start to stink but  c'mon its a bucket full of poopy diapers.As you child grows, or if you have older children watch out. The handle system fascinates  little ones and they find it amusing that they can put something in, flip it and it disappears,  which is good when it's a diaper, bad when it's,,, your keys.",1
"We saw this crib at Babies R Us but they only had it in black.  I went on the manufacturer's website and it said sold at Amazon.  I have ordered lots from Amazon before but not something so large.  It came in less than the amount of time it said it would, not damaged at all!  Very easy to put together and now we are just waiting for the baby to arrive!  The white is a clean white, not off white or antique.",1
I love my maya wrap and also my pretty momma sling from [...] my first baby didn't like the wrap she preferred the ring sling.,1
I had this four-dollar item in my cart for ages before finally getting sick of stepping on the bath toys in the tub (or having to clean them out and find a home for them in a very small bathroom).  I'm so glad I bought it!  It suctions easily onto the surface of the tub (wherever you want it) and keeps the toys dry and gunk-free between baths.  So convenient and simple - this goes on my list of must-haves!,1
"Great seat, i have 2 marathons in my car, but needed an extra seat for my husbands car so after reading other reviews I went for this one... It really doesn't seem too much different",1
"I know no one's ever heard of Spectra in the US but that will change soon. This pump is FANTASTIC. It's super quiet, could not be any easier to use, built super solid, and unbeatable quality for the price!Pros:-Pump is heavy enough I wouldn't want to pack it up everyday (a bit heavier than Medela PIS) but I would if I didn't have a pump to stay at the office. It's heavy because its made of solid parts so I can't knock it.-Parts are medela interchangeable. So fits M bottles and even the little pieces inside the bottle..the white flaps, etc. This is great if like me, you already have a bunch of Medela stuff. in fact you could use all your plastic parts from a Swing or PIS attached to this pump motor. It came with one adapter to enable pumping straight into Advent bottles as well.-its SUPER powerful. I used my Medela PIS and Swing on max suction. I use my Dew on 50-60% suction.-It can take a hit. My pump has been knocked hard by my toddler twice. Both times it still turned on and sounded fine but no suction. After contacting the US and Australia Spectra FB pages for guidance, I undid a couple of screws, took off the cover, reattached the internal tube and we were back in business.-the extra bottles, cooler, ice pack--all great.-it's hospital grade, no milk can get inside, its safe to resell-it looks like a big, well, boob.Cons:-Tote bag is a lil' ugly to my mind (like a fake fashion brand). It's not so well made or made for the pump specifically, its just some random bag and if I had to transport the pump every day I wouldn't trust it for that.-The 'horn' assembly is all one piece so you can't change the size of your flanges, change to a soft one etc. I have Pumpin Pals flanges and though they're supposed to be universal I don't think they work very well with this. Luckily for me this size is fine for me so it's not a problem but might not work for others.I would buy this again in a heartbeat.",1
Baby hates the taste. I drink it now and it doesn't seem to phase her as they claim the effects can be passed through breastmilk. It does help keep up milk supply though.,0
"Bought it in white and the candle itself it is a good size and height. I think the thing I dislike the most is that the part of the candle with the age and pictures is actually a STICKER, makes the whole thing turn into something cheap looking! Some may say ""well what did you think it was?""...Well I've had many candles before with decorative pictures and such and they weren't stickers! The candle is nice but the whole sticker thing is ridiculous to me. So after you burn down to the next age, you have to cut the sticker down because its just left there sticking up with no candle behind it anymore. At the time I bought this I didn't see any reviews letting me know it was a sticker, maybe I missed one because I never would have figured that was what the designs were on. So, oh, well, you've been warned....if you're okay with that then this is the candle for you! I'm a little bummed because I dropped $20 on this thing and my daughter will be stuck with it for 21 more years, not really worth spending this kind of money trying out a different one, they all have their faults of some sort from the reviews I've read.",0
We have a very capable 2 year old and he conquered everything else we used.These are great and they really work.Very Happy,1
I was having trouble deciding between this style and one that permanently attaches to the wall and swings/collapses. I'm glad I went with this; it's pretty easy to put up and take down though it needs to be readjusted every 3-4 uses by twisting the bar a couple turns.The fabric mesh is a good deal flimsier than what I was expecting; think of those collapsible laundry hampers and you'll get a good idea. I'm actually pretty surprised my dogs haven't torn through it. Yes I realize I'll probably regret typing that!,1
"This product works well.  It's small enough to be convenient, and the size of the water reservoir under the plate guarantees that hot food stays hot or cold food is gently warmed to a more palatable temperature.  Easy to use, easy to clean.",1
"Ever how they described this thing NOT. I would have sent it back but didn't notice until I had received it , it was a Non Returnable item. What?I willl be alot more careful when ordering next time. I swear I didn't see that statement.Would not , absolutely Not , reccommend this item to anyone.",0
It's really girly. I'm debating sending it back it looks different in the picture. THe content is awesome it's exactly what I want  I might just switch cover.,0
These cups were the perfect step after the bottle for our son. Easy enough for him to use by himself and leak proof,1
"I have 2 small children that I need to get accurate temperatures and this thermometer read surfaces & room temps with more accuracy than people. I used this thermometer on everyone in my house (3 adults, 1 toddler & 1 infant), multiple times & it read the same temp to the decimal place... it was reading an acceptable temp (98.1) however it is not accurate enough for my needs.",0
Love this bouncer for our babies(twins).  The music is wonderful and the caterpillar bar flashing colors and pictures are entertaining. I did not have any problems assembling it and it works great!,1
"A more advanced grab and hold toy.  Lots of things to discover such as; colors, textures, shiny mirror interior, safe moving parts that hide the happy face, and a rattle sound.  Just a great toy at a good price.",1
"Super cute chair, but the rockers are terrible. The chair sits way back and doesn't rock like a chair should. We took the wooden rockers off and just use it as a regular chair. Very disappointed.",0
"This is great!  My son's bed is a regular full-size bed and this still fits it perfectly as it is very adjustable (the two sides are connected under the bed but it adjusts for different size beds).  I like how the rail can be folded down for access.  It does get in the way of making the bed, to some extent, but any rails would.  These definitely keep him from rolling off of the bed.  We feel comfortable that he is safe with these rails in place.  I would buy this same product again.",1
"I love this high chair!  When she was little it was so easy to turn her toward us to feed her. Now that she's 18 months and feeds herself the removable tray is awesome and although the seat gets quite messy from time to time it is easily removed, can be thrown in the washing machine and I swear it looks brand new after I take it out!  It's kind of hard to figure out how to remove it and replace it the first time but after that its a breeze. If you're looking for a way to keep your little one involved in your family mealtime and save space in your dining room this is the perfect chair for you!We have a high top dining room table and were lucky that the chair fit perfectly on the underside with the fold away table leaves down there. We don't remove the chair to take with us but with another table that it fit easier on I can see how that would be doable. Although there are cheaper ones that would be just as good for traveling.",1
The product works well.  Everything from my medicine cabinet fits nicely. The latch is tricky to open so I don't think any little fingers will be getting into it.,1
I love the Crystal Clear Nursery Monitor. I buy them for all of my friends when they are having a baby. I can not wait til I get one for my new baby. I think every parent would enjoy one on there home. It's easy to use and works great.,1
This product has worked great and the life expectancy is amazing. My wife is happy and so am I with the product. So I would definitely recommend this product especially for the price.,1
"If you want an EXTRA FIRM mattress for your little one, look no further! The poor child might as well sleep on the concrete! I did give it two stars because it does seem to be very well made. BUT I will be returning this mattress!",0
"I tried this with an Alvababy pocket diaper, and my heavy wetter/overnight bottle feeder was dry for 13 hours overnight.",1
"Our baby loves this! She is 5 months old, and loves watching the animals projected on the wall. We like the voice activated feature too, which helps in the mornings when she starts to wake up...it definitely buys my wife and I more sleep time. We also liked how small the machine is, it actually surprised us when we opened the shipment. The product isn't too loud, and the music is ok. I definitely would recommend this product to others!",1
"I have cloth diapered since my daughter's birth, a year ago. She has consistently been in the 99th percentile for height and weight. Bum Genius and Nubunz are what I use most of the time, and these do not compare. The removable velcro is a nice feature, for sure, and while it is true that the liners don't get lost, you still have to straighten them out and tuck them into their pocket which ends up being the same amount of work as stuffing a liner into a Bum Genius diaper. The fit isn't so much a problem, especially with my chunky girl, but the major problem with these is that they leak in a terrible way. The fabric is not waterproof in the least and the liners are not up to snuff when it comes to soaking up a 1 year old's pee. I'm really quite disappointed with them. My only consolation is I found them on sale for half the regular price, so i'm not out that much money.",0
"Well we had already used this cup for our daughter and she took to it very well. We decided to try it for our son as well and he also took to it with no problem. Awsome cup to move off of the bottle from. As far as the shipping, I paid for 2 day and received it the next day!",1
"My 5 month old loves Sophie! We gave it to him for Christmas and she's been one of his favorites every since. A little expensive, but worth it!",1
"I love my Quinny stroller! I love the look of it (modern, simple and stylish) and I love the functionality of it, which is a way more important factor when it comes to babies and all their gear. Our son is three months old so we've started him in the Quinny Dreami Bassinet and he feels so cozy in it! It's got a PLUSH liner throughout the whole inside of it and a foamy cushioned bottom. More often that not, we put him down in it and he sleeps in it all through the night, and, sleeps better in it than in his crib. He seems lost in his crib and he's seemingly much more content in the cushy bassinet. Besides quickly interchanging the bassinet on and off (one button press on each side and off it goes!) it also interchanges wonderfully with the Maxi-Cosi car seat that we have. Soooo convenient!!!! And you can have forward or backwards versatility, again with the push of one button. It collapses super easily. And, I love how it unfolds automatically. No fighting with it in the Target parking lot! The brake system is well thought out and lastly, the turning radius is awesome. Turns really easily in small elevators and store aisles. My brother is having a baby in the fall and I've totally recommended he buy this stroller.",1
Great balls the kids love them and I'll probably buy more as they will power the balls out of our yard and lose them.,1
"I recieved the item fast which was good, but the size was not as expected",0
"My daughter is 2 & just in the beginning stages of potty training, but so far, we love this portable cushion.  So glad we purchased it!!",1
"I was a little nervous after reading the reviews, but these work well. Little One has not been able to pull it off yet and it has those little hands from opening the door. Overall I am pleased with the product.",1
I bought this product coz I was so against baby walkers.  My daughter totally loves it and it keeps her entertained for anywhere b/w 15-30 mins.,1
"My son hates being put down so I bought this swing hoping that he'd a similar feeling to me holding him (or at least he'd be moving around). So far, it's done well. The trick to putting my baby down to sleep in it was putting him on his side (he's not a back sleeper at all). I don't like that the swing is timed...luckily I have a baby monitor with a camera so I can see when the swing stops if I'm not in the room--I have to run back and press the button again to restart. This is very inconvenient with a light sleeper! I use it several hours a week and the batteries have lasted for over two months, which is great.",1
"I have these and another kind of reusable nursing pad -- I prefer these!  They are large enough and even though they aren't ""contoured"" like some others, I haven't had a problem with them slipping or showing through.  I like that there is an outer layer that seems to be water resistant, as I haven't had anything leak through like with my other pads.  If I were to go back and purchase again, I would get a second set of these instead of the other brand I purchased.  They are also far more comfortable and less itchy than the disposable ones I have tried.",1
I use this in my sons room tO just collectThe daily diapers and empty into my big wet bag at night. I would not recommend as your main bag - as it holds a handful of diapers/inserts but works perfect for my use so I just have to take the dirty diapers down at the end of the night. I hook the little pouch to my diaper bag as a pacifier holder (nice little bonus). The bags don't dont fully close so wouldnt recommend as main bag but were perfect for what I wanted and price I was looking for. I have had it for month plus and wash it every couple days with the diapers and holding up great.,1
"I bought this monitor in 2011 for my son.  I did a lot of research and chose the Motorola.  Everything was great...of course I was comparing it to an audio only monitor, but still, it was great.  I liked that you could add cameras, had night vision, temperature gauge, etc, etc.  Then, one night, I turn on the monitor and all I saw was a white screen.  I could still hear the baby, just not see him.  I turned it off, took out the battery, let it sit for a bit, replaced the battery and lo' and behold, it worked.  Long story short, I never called Motorola.  Once my son got out of the infant phase, we didn't use the monitor as much, so the problem didn't present itself as much.Long story short, the warranty has run out and now with my third child, the white screen happens all the time.  I called customer service and they were horrible.  Since it's out of warranty, there is no more conversation.  So now, at 1am or 4am or whenever, I have to unscrew the back of the monitor, take the battery out, and go through the whole process.  It's easier to walk across the hallway and check on my baby instead....Motorola's customer service is horrible...farmed out and I waited a LONG time before someone picked up.  He was very hard to understand.",0
So cute and soft for my 1 year old daughter. She loves to cuddle and sleep with it! I would highly reccomend it!,1
"I rarely ever leave a review but this product is one of the reasons I love Amazon.  I googled child proof lever door lock and this popped up.  I read the reviews, bought it and we love it.My son sleeps with my husband and me and was sneaking out of the bed at night and I was worried sick about him getting in to something that could hurt him.  We have lever door handles and the traditional childproof locks for them didn't impress me at all.  My son is 2 and can disassemble anything he can reach.  I am so glad I found the door monkey!  The door does stay cracked open but that isn't a concern for us.  I have been spreading the word about this product to anyone with small children.  Try it.  You won't be disappointed.",1
"Our son attends a public school in NYC that has plastic sleeping mats for nap time.  We've tried using small blankets and pillows for him to use on top of the mats but have often found them on the floor or lost in the cubbies.  I was looking for an all-in-one napmat that could do the job and insure my sons skin would not end up on the school's plastic mat during his nap with all the shifting and turning.  This mat was the answer!  It's the perfect size for preK or Kinder.  My son is about 42"" tall and his feet stick out a little under the blanket but that doesn't concern me since the kids nap with their shoes on.  The mat base itself is long enough to fit his whole body.  The mat is well made and the attached top (cover) blanket is super soft and wide enough to wrap around him completely.  He unrolled and rolled it back and found it very easy to store.  It's definitely made to supplement a plastic mat.  If it were placed on hardwood or another hard flooring it would not be comfortable.  Since our school uses the plastic nap mats, this was perfect to set on top for both comfort and hygiene.  We're so happy with our purchase.",1
They were perfect and my friend loved them and have them in his front yard.Even his Mom loved them.Would buy them again.,1
Got these bottles and figured they would work the same as the ones that we usually buy from Walmart/Target.  We had a problem with 2 of the seals not sealing enough and the formula would drip out of the bottom.  Bought some of the ones from Walmart and we do not have that problem at all.,0
"NOT SOFT OR THICK! Besides the pretty design Im not sure how this was meant to be a towel for an infant. As the previous reviewer said, it rough thin terry cloth which was packaged nicely and by the time you open it, disappointment sets in. I don't think it is long enough either, once I wrap my 4 month old in it the legs stick out. Will keep looking for something else.",0
I bought these valances and they are actually wider than i expected so I ended up with a couple extra which I combined with some mint green sheers and the room looks so beautiful. It is a must have to go with the crib bedding set.,1
"It takes up a lot of room, but this is a great drying rack for bottles.  I use the Medela bottles right now, and it's the perfect size for my day or two's worth I wash.",1
"Its my new bestfriend,I use it my five year old. She love to get her hair wash now!",1
"The installation consists of sticking the holder on the tank with the sticky tape provided. However, the tape came with barely any sticking power at all! Less than 10 seconds after I stuck it on according to the instructions, it was slowly slipping down the tank. I attempted to reapply it several times, and same story each time--fell right off in less than 30 seconds.I will be returning this to the retail store where it was purchased.",0
"These are the best bibs, they clean up so easily and fit my 13 mo son very well.  Highly recommend!",1
"There are some great things about this and some not so great. I love that it's BPA and Lead Free! Also, steaming is pretty handy. I don't like the directions, the food is over-cooked and too much water. For me, that's an easy fix, just have to learn the timing, adjust water amounts. I am still not positive about the blending portion of it. I do not cook my fruit, never needed to with my old baby blender but got tired of issues with it and thought I'd try the Beaba. If you put 1 single juicy peach, pear, etc. in the container to blend, it can't do it. More food is better but still not sure about the texture. If I need to add more than 1 item then I can just use my vitamix, kinda defeats the ""all in 1"" purpose of buying a super expensive item. Hoping its made well and holds up! I've only had it a week so keeping my fingers crossed.After continuing to use this, I am not happy with it and returned it. It does not blend the food fine enough for new eaters, very gritty!",0
"There are two height adjustments, which made this more appealing.  I love that there is storage too.  You can hide some of the bath clutter.",1
This is the best bath toy. Our baby is 5 months old and he can grab and play with this toy in the bath. Water flows through it. It's loved by baby and mom alike.,1
"Right out of the package, the Skip Hop Forma Pack & Go Diaper Tote Bag is beautiful.  The peacock color is so attractive without screaming, ""BABY BAG!""  The bag is large enough to pack enough diapers, supplies and clothing for a weekend with the grandparents.  The pockets are plentiful and well-placed.  I am disappointed that there is no shoulder strap option.  The tote straps are basically long enough to carry the bag on your shoulder, but it isn't really comfortable ... especially when the bag is well-stocked.  I also don't understand why the stroller shuttle clips are attached to the interior lining of the bag.  I actually don't feel secure attaching the well-stocked bag to the stroller because I feel as if the fabric is going to rip where it attaches.  I also found it troublesome that there were so many loose thread when I opened the bag.  I hope this is not an indication that the fabric is going to fray.  The included changing pad is generous and fits nicely into the large rear pocket.  The included insulated zip pouch and mesh pouch are great for organizing.  I love the fact that the bag is constructed and stands upright on its own.  The bag is very light weight which is appreciated more and more with each item you stuff in.  Overall, I don't think this will be my everyday diaper bag because it is rather large and bulky; but I think it is absolutely perfect for packing up for trips to the babysitter and the grandparents.",1
"Daddy likes to let our first daughter explore with the best of them. She climbs, cruises and wants to get into or onto everything and daddy lets her. This thing has saved some headaches for both daddy and daughter when she falls and goes boom. She has wacked her head like every other kid and the crying could be heard down the street. With this on, the shock is on her face but the crying is minimal at best. Love it",1
"I travel a few times a year, so I'm usually looking for better ways to pack necessary items.  This is small enough to fit in my luggage.  I like to add my own dusting powder to it and not store bought.  Thank you for selling this product without the powder!",1
Really like these bottles they are nice looking and durable. I also like how you can run it under hot water and will heat liquid. The only issue I have had with the bottle's is that one of them leak which I believe its just an issue with the nipple other than that enjoy these bottles for newborn.,1
"If you use ""time-out"" as a method to deal with your toddler, this is a helpful product because it's portable.  The portablity allows you to use the mat outside the home and ensures consistency when using time out since the child is used the mat.",1
Only negative is the music which is really really badly done...we just turned it off.  Otherwise it was a very nice purchase.,1
"This is a pretty fabulous stroller frame with only a few drawbacks. I bought it second-hand while I was pregnant because I wasn't sure how much I was going to use it, but I envisioned the convenience of being able to put a sleeping baby from car to stroller without having to wake him/her up by taking the baby out of the carseat. Turns out, my son was a fairly high-needs infant who I pretty much had to wear in a wrap or carrier for the first 3 months straight. When I put him in the stroller, he cried. He didn't end up liking the stroller until about 2.5 or 3 months, after which he enjoyed it.Anyway, I still think the use is great for just putting the carseat right into the frame. I have a Chicco Keyfit 30, and while it doesn't snap in, it sets right down in the frame with ease, and then you can just snap a buckle across the carseat for safety purposes. My carseat's sunshade is useless, and because the carseat sets right down in the stroller, my baby's face was pointed right up at the sky with really no sun protection. For that reason, I moved on to using my bigger stroller on sunny days (but that is not the Easy Traveller's fault, really). So, I keep my full stroller at home and this one in the car in case I need a stroller while I'm out, since my baby will obviously always be in his carseat if we're in the car. The Easy Traveller swivels and turns amazingly- but, surprisingly, my relatively inexpensive Joovy Kooper stroller gives a smoother ride over bumps and cracks than the Easy Traveller. The fold of this stroller is so easy- I can do it one-handedly while holding my baby, and then I can pick it up by the handle and walk while holding both it and my son, and my big diaper bag slung across my shoulder (it is pretty lightweight). The basket underneath is gigantic. The folded-up stroller takes up little room in my car's trunk or my closet. It is wide when open, though, and holds the carseat relatively low (to the point where you need to take the carseat out of the frame in order to get anything out of the basket, which I found to be a huge pain, especially if I was trying not to wake up my light-sleeping son...the whole reason why I bought this stroller in the first place).Overall, I would recommend this for someone looking for the same conveniences out of a stroller frame as I was.",1
It was a life saver in the hash Chicago winters. I had to insert an extra folded blanket inside and zip it to make it warmer. It performed well under snow and mild rain but you might need a plastic wrap during heavy rains. My baby was not a fun of the product but it was necessary.,1
I love my stroller and car seat!! Haven't quite used it yet but it looks just like the picture did!! I didn't want anything pink and brown since that color combo seems to be overused. I wanted something feminine and chic but not baby-ish and that's exactly what I found! I would recommend this to anyone! I also bought the matching play yard as well.,1
"This is the best gate we've ever owned!! Super easy to install and works great for keeping our boxers in their area of the apartment :D I love the easy to open door and the fact we never have to take down the gate when we need to go through...also works great for my 3year old, the foot release requires quite a bit of pressure to open the door so only the adults are able to do it...even though my child and dogs have tried :3 The only thing is our chihuahuas are able to squeeze through the gate but they are only 2-3lbs..if you have dogs this small then you may need to reconsider this one..but it meets our needs hands down, Excellent product!!!!",1
"Useful ToolsThey come handy for washing and cleaning narrow items such as bottle straws, machinery and guns' parts. They are not heavy duty but they will do the job.",0
"The main weakness of this diaper for us is that it does get easily damp/wet at the bottom near the edge of the leg openings, so we had quite a few incidents of leaks in spite of a proper fit. When I examined the problem, it seemed that the inserts that come with the diaper are too narrow, leaving the inside edges of the bottom unprotected. Furthermore, because the inserts are super soft, they also tend to bunch up all to the middle, exacerbating the above problem. To fix the issue (we had quite a few unsuccessful initial trial and error), I ended up altogether replacing the inserts with my own version: one insert from my Kawaii Baby Good Night Heavy Wetter diaper plus one trim hemp fleece liner underneath (BabyKicks Joey-Bunz Premium brand). This combination (i.e. wider and firmer lining) fixed our problem and now we can successfully use the diaper without any leaks during the day. I haven't tested this at night, though, but I'm guessing with the addition of a second Kawaii insert, it might work. Our baby is also very sensitive to feeling wet, but seems to tolerate the micro-fleece inside on these as well as our other two favorites, Kawaii Good Night and Bumgenius 4.0, which is a plus. Otherwise, the diaper is sturdy and a bit on the bulkier side (ironic that it's called ""Tiny Tush""), which means we'll be able to use it till potty training. Velcro is strong and has held up well thus far as well.",0
"These cups are fantastic for teaching your toddler to drink out of a real cup. The rubbery texture makes it 'stick' to smooth surfaces so they are very hard to tip over, and they are narrow enough that kids can put their little hands around them easily. We would fill them about 1/3 with milk and our daughter learned very quickly how to drink from them, and at 2 years old she hardly ever uses a sippy and rarely spills with these. My only complaint is that the yellow got stained permanently somehow (we may have put blueberry smoothie in there once or twice!) but otherwise they are great,very durable, and clean easily.",1
"OK, I know this seems like an idiot gift, but if you're a new parent it's hard to remember ANYTHING with the lack of sleep going on. This thing pretty much ruled our lives the first few months. It really helps you keep your baby on a regular schedule (good for babe and you)and helps you figure out what's wrong if the baby's upset since you can just check the time to see when he last ate, slept, or was changed. And if you're nursing, good luck trying to remember which side you started nursing with last (i never could) so this was GREAT.The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because it would be awesome if they made a feature to track the times that you could hookup to your computer to look at trends, etc... then again, who has time to track trends with a newborn!",1
my son got this for christmas at three months. is now six months. he loves this toy. very tactile. good stimulation. not overwhelming.,1
"This organizer works great with our Baby Jogger City Mini.  Holds two 16+ oz water bottles, small teething toys, cell phone, keys no problem.  Collapses nicely when stroller is stored without having to take it off.  Velcro straps make it easy to change from regular stroller over to jogger when we go outside.",1
Our little guy had bad reflux when he was born and his food would come out of his nose. The hospital one's are good but don't get everything so I ordered this and it was awesome! It sucked everything out and my son could breath. I get it for all my friends having babies and they love it as well!,1
"Definitely keeps the odor in, so the room does not smell.  Easy to open with the foot.  Looks nice.  Solved our smell problem",1
My husband finally installed the magnetic locks and I absolutely love them.  I can't comment on the installation as I stayed away for that part but the locks work great. I love the fact that you don't have to open a drawer or door and smash your finger in the process of trying to unlock it. I believe this is item is well worth the price.,1
"I ordered two of these for our two story terrace in order to keep my 1 and 3 year olds out of harms way.  I've read some negative things about the edges, but I seriously do not see a problem.  The netting is made out of a very strong transparent material.  You can not see the netting from a distance, and the product is quality in my opinion.  We are very pleaseed with this product.",1
This little bag is perfect to carry to the pool or beach to hold your wet swimsuit and/or towel. It's a great size - small enough to fold up and stuff in your purse or bag and yet big enough to hold a swimsuit and decent size towel. I generally use it to hold both of my kids' wet suits after we swim. The bag doesn't leak and keeps wet suits from making a mess in the car. Love it!,1
"I have the Apple & Bee giraffe changing pad and wanted to get the bib to go with it.  The bib, while cute, cannot be put in the washer or dryer but needs to be spot cleaned.  What mom of an infant has time to spot clean a bib?  The bib has a cloth trim and terry backing.  I can't imagine how nasty a that bib is going to get along the neckline and on the back with only spot cleaning occurring, and length of time to air dry a terry cloth-backed bib would be far too long to make the bib useful for anything other than a photo op.",0
"I used to have the Peg Perego Prima highchair, fancy namebrand and high price tag, but, it was crap.  This one is really easy to clean, no tiny grooves and the fabric wipes clean easily.  I highly recommend it!",1
"I received this as a gift two years ago with my first daughter, who loved it.  Now my second daughter has adopted it and loves it even more.  Excellent quality, easy to clean, and both my girls love it!",1
"When you are a mom or dad you know products that make your life easier are usually over priced or you feel you can just 'deal' with it.  Bobee is an amazing product, I love it.  It has made my life so much easier, not to mention my husbands too.  Waking up in the middle of the night for a change and feeding, this made cleaning up the dirty diaper a breeze!  Thanks!",1
"I ordered this item based on the other reviews here and I'm really happy we did.  I liked the functionality and the look of this changer.  I didn't like the idea of having to use covers and many reviewers said they used this for light bathing in the first few weeks.  Plus, it just looks awesome!  Our baby is due in a few weeks, so we have yet to use it, but it seems like a solid purchase so far.  I was skeptical about the material not being cold, however, it sat outside in sub-0 temperatures all day and was still warm to the touch when we opened it!  I had read the reviews about it taking the finish/paint off some furniture, so I bought some clear contact paper and put it down under the changer, just in case. I'll edit my review once we start using the item, but so far I'm really happy with the purchase.UPDATE: We LOVE this!  We love that the material is so warm and our little girl doesn't scream when we put her on it.  It's really easy to clean and comfortable for our baby.  I would certainly recommend this product.",1
Awesome quality.  I think it is excellent value for the money.  It's darling and unique too.  I highly recommend it.,1
"This blanket is great for the outdoors. I take it to the beach, parks, picnics, etc. I am very pleased with the quality of it. It's a perfect size for 2 people to lay down comfortably on the beach or 3-4 people to sit down. Either way, I love it!",1
"My baby started teething early, so this was absolutely perfect for her.  She didn't have great aim to get things in her mouth, so the length and the softness was perfect.  Every time she sees this toy she gets excited, it's one of her favorites.  It's easy to keep clean.  Worth every penny.",1
"This toy is adorable...... My son likes to bang on it with his hands and the stick.  My only complaints are really that he is constantly shoving the stick into his mouth like a lollipop and I keep having to pull it out.  Also, I think it's genious that the stick is attached to the xylophone, but the string attaching it is not quite long enough to pound the keys correctly - especially the smaller ones on the end.  I understand this probably has something to do with the fact that if the string was longer, it may pose a strangulation hazard, so I can get over that.  Also, the sound itself isn't quite right, but whatever - it's a baby toy and he enjoys playing with it!  :)",1
"My sister loves this, and uses it daily with my nephew that can't seem to get the food to his mouth!",1
"I just noticed this morning when I caught the end of the movie-in the emotional taxi scene towards the end, this is the last thing he gives the baby:)my son loved teething on this and it is great for reaching both the back 2 year old molars and the tough front canines-my son still likes to play with his giraffe!",1
"I did not read the spec when I bought this toy, I thought it would be a regular size toy. To my surprise this and other toys I bought was a nice size and nicely made.",1
"I travel a lot and was very excited when I found this online for my second child.  Tried several times to use but my son would refuse it.  Ended up using the bottle as a bowl to make oatmeal for him.  I read the reviews prior, so I had packed bottles.  Suggest order one pack first to try out before a tip.",0
I'm surprised by how sturdy this thing really is.  We bought this for the grandparents and another for almost twice the price for ourselves.  This is actually more stable/robust then the more expensive chair.  The tray also seems huge.  Great value for the price Amazon is selling this for.  No bells and whistles but it will definitely do the job.,1
"i love this brand of diaper bags, i feel they will last me the longest b/c they are more versatile than the ones that scream baby -- i can use them to go to work, etc and not worry about it looking too diaper-bag-ish.  i have to admit, i have a few diaper bags, a few timi and leslies also...and this shape is my favorite of the 'casual'/canvas group.  it has a lot of storage and pockets, the height and width of the pockets would be good from early on.  many of their bags are better for certain ages, but this one is good from the beginning.  the puffiness which usually gets me with their canvas bags doesn't bother me so much on this bag...probably bc its wider than the rest of them and each outer pocket is already larger. *maybe* if i had received this bag first i would have stopped looking at others...well, ok not me.  since i have always loved bags and accessories - but you get the idea.",1
"I would recommend this to anyone, our 6 month old loves this teether!  It is easy to clean, easy for him to hold and every inch of it is useable for him.",1
"This worked alright to give our infant some medicine for thrush and her probiotics but if you didn't use it just right it would leak all over, which is not fun with sticky meds or limited prescription meds. It was the best way we found after trying several syringes, medicine cups, and dropper style dispensers, but still not perfect. It also was a little big for our 4-7 week old.",0
This is a very helpful accessory for my stroller. I have two as I feel two hold my shopping bags more steadily.,1
"We really do love these cups. Our son has been very interested in drinking out of our cups but never really got the hang of the hard spout sippy cups or the straws. I thought since he could sort of drink out of a regular cup with help that these would be a great fit. He definitely picked it up much faster. He still is more interested in playing with it and really doesn't drink a ton out of it (we only put water in them which could be the reason) but he definitely gets some out of it and he is so proud of himself when he does! They are also super easy to clean with no little pieces to worry about, just 3 pieces, no hole or valves or anything. The only downside is they are not entirely leak-proof but as long as you put it back together correctly it isn't too bad and it mostly leaks a little if it is thrown. I think it's worth it though. these are a winner in my book!",1
"I received this blanket as a baby shower gift, along with countless others. However, this one ended up being a stand out! In fact, I bought another one after I saw how much we were using it once the little man arrived. The size and shape are so much better than the standard rectangular type that you often see. This one makes it easy to swaddle, and with the instructions right on the tag, even first-time parents like us will get the hang of swaddling right away. It washes well and is large enough to also serve as a carrier cover when little one is sleeping while we're out and about. It is nice and thick, so we used it a lot more in the fall and winter, but I think it will continue to serve as a nice little blanket for years to come.",1
"I gott so many bibs from people. this is my favorit. It is large and covers my 6 month old fully, unlike a lot of other bibs which are much smaller. It is smooth and waterproof. Can be rinsed off and air dried. An one of my favorite Dr. Seuss books. The bib graphics are really cute!",1
We bought these to replace old high chair straps on a graco high chair and they worked great! Even better than the original straps that came on the high chair and easy to install!,1
"I had my first son in 2009. Like others, I had heard from mom friends that the Madela pumps were the leaders in pump technology and comfort. But because I was able to drop my work schedule down, I only needed to express one or two bottles a day. I had no need for a more hefty double pump.  The Madela Swing was new, and since other brands back in 2009 hadn't completely converted to BPA free, I decided to get the Swing, a Born Free Adaptor, and Born Free bottles.The pump was easy to assemble and use. It came apart easily, and I liked that the pieces were compatible/exchangeable with the hand pump version. The dual stage pump system with the fast start then slower longer pumps were comfortable and effective.  I was able to pump quickly and efficiently. My husband happened to watch once and was amazed at how milk was ""shooting out of my nipple.""However, after a couple of months of use, I noticed that it was taking longer to pump out four to six ounces and that the highest setting just didn't seem to work. I called Madela customer suppor  and they suggested that I get a replacement tube. (Note: I had already replaced the little plastic valve/flap that creates the barrier between the pump parts and the bottle.) I went ahead and ordered the tube, ordering through their website after looking up part numbers from my manual. This seemed to work. But after a couple of successes, I felt the pump wasn't working again. I called again.I tried using the neck piece from my hand pump to rule out that, tried refitting all of the pieces just in case I had a leak in the joints - sometimes pieces warped if boiled too long or they sat on the bottom of the pot.  After calling customer support and replacing every piece possible except the pump, it became obvious that the pump wasn't working. Per customer support, I checked the internal black sponge to make sure that was dry - I had never accidentally sucked milk up there. The sponge was dry.If you are still reading, you can see that this is not going well. I struggled along for another three months, knowing that the pump was not working well. But it worked enough that I could stave off tears of frustration and power through.  By the time my son was five to six months old, he could wait for me to come home to nurse and he was eating other foods which made pumping unnecessary.Fast forward to 2013...I have a second son. After establishing a good nursing routine, I took out my old Madela Swing, cleaned it all up, put in all new replacement parts since I had stored all of them from the last time. Of course, since it was the first time I pumped this time around, I knew it would take longer. But after twenty minutes and getting only 5-6 mLs, I was upset and frustrated.  My husband went out and got me the Avent Single Electric just so I could compare. There was no comparison. The suction was much stronger and I was able to pump an ounce in seven to ten minutes. Not bad for a first pump.All-in-all, while the Swing worked well to start, it lost suction and power over just five months of using it once or twice a day. For the price tag, I find this absolutely unacceptable. I tried multiple fixes, contacted customer support - who were always helpful to suggest fixes -, and just muddled. Honestly, it was the price of it that kept me from just getting a new one, but after a while the cost of all the replacement parts soon added up and I would have been better off investing in a new pump.  In for a penny, in for a pound...I would say, that unless they have changed this pump's design since 2009, be weary of it losing power overtime and don't second guess yourself if you notice a change.  I will see if the Avent pump has a similar issue overtime. If you have a different experience with this pump purchased after 2009, please post to the comments so that others can see if this issue has been corrected in subsequent versions of this pump.",0
"After the very 1st wash they were nice and soft, I was amazed! I thought they were very affordable too. I need to get another dozen soon! Highly recommend them...",1
"I bought the frog before my baby was born because I heard amazing things about it.  Once my child was born, it proved far too bulky to place in the backseat of my subaru outback (forget shopping with this item), yes this is a car designed to haul a lot, so I was shocked.  I ended up purchasing a universal car seat carrier so I could place her carseat in it.  I barely use the bugaboo because whenever I go shopping with the frog, there is no place to store bags. (I love the storage in the snap and go!) Even after I got a bag clip from buy buy baby, the stroller tips over if you clip anything more than a small purse on it.  It's very flimsy.  Additionally, the basket underneath is a joke.  If you put anything other than a bottle in it, it drags to the floor and the fabric hits the wheels.  It is very hard to steer when this is done.  On the bright side, for the first 3 months, we were able to stroller her to our house of worship and to parks while she would sleep away in the small bassinet. I wish the bassinet had a seat belt to secure her in though. I felt it was unsafe to take her in stores this way. (Maybe that's just crazy overprotective me.) However, once she got to be 13lbs, we had to use the seat feature (she wanted to sit up and explore the world when not sleeping and well her feet started to hit the end of the bassinet).  It's too hard to take the fabric on and off, so this became a permanent decision. If you want the flexibility of moving between the bassinet and seat, get a second seat frame on ebay.  Don't pay more than 140 for that.  Forget buying a cupholder (it doesn't come with one), because if you do, it will make it virtually impossible to shop in any clothing stores without bumping into things between the aisles.  Also, it tilts at an angle that you would have to have a closed bottle in it and hope it doesn't fall out.  The seat has a weirdly placed folds below the knees of a 4 month old and it is uncomfortable for her.  The straps are good, but she doesn't have any head support.  Additionally, the weight limit on this stroller is incredibly low for the price.  My child is now 6 months old and I am noticing it has a pretty narrow seat.  I plan on buying a maclaren quest or techno (55lb weight limit) to use daily and just use this one for occassional walks.  It does work well on grave, but realistically, I rarely go on gravel.  I live in the suburbs and we have side walks.  Although, you could easily hike with this or jog.  After test driving about 30 strollers in buy buy baby and babysrus,  I decided the UPPA is what I should have bought.  Sure it might not be the popular choice, but it has a much bigger basket, folds in one piece (not taking up my entire trunk), and seems to be more sturdy.  I think for the next kid I will get that.  Oh and don't buy it in black, it looks nice, but it attracts heat and well on a hot summer sunny day, that is not what you want your kid to have to deal with.  Not worth the price!!!",0
"Good size, lots of compartments, area for wipes, bottles, clothes, etc. backpack style great & convenient for Dad! Thought it wouldn't have as much inside areas but it is well equipped. Very satisfied with sturdiness & make of bag.",1
"I echo the other reviewers comments. The lid does not stay on at all, I put that in the closet a long time ago. The potty leaks every single time my daughter uses the potty. I think it leaks down between the seat and bowl and then pools in the bottom or leaks onto the floor. The seat is difficult to remove to clean. The flush mechanism held no interest to her and just ended up being something to mess with. I bought 2 of these chairs, one for my house and one for grandma's. They both leak. We are just about finished training, otherwise, I would spend the money on a different potty chair. Also, the bowl does come out easily and now my 2 year old tries to pull it out and empty it herself, leading to even more mess.",0
Nice toddler bed sheeting set for the money. I like that the flat sheet has elastic to keep it on the bed.,1
What can I say - these are great bottles that serve many different purposes for breastfeeding and bottle feeding. I'm a fan.,1
I ordered 21 of them for work open five packages and every single one did not work. I would not recommend buying them.Now I have the fun of trying to return them and get my money back,0
"This is a very solid piece of kids equipment.. No plastic parts here. The frame is made of real metal, and is extremely sturdy and well built.Its like a real miniature workout bench! I do wish the bench was adjustable, but its no big deal.My son is only 2 1/2 so its perfect for him, but I can see it being a little small for bigger kinds.But well worth the price.. I highly recommend!",1
"I bought this for my 4 month old -- who is now almost 11 months old -- when we began practicing Elimination Communication (early infant potty training).  The one piece design is great for easy clean-up and also to minimize the baby playing with it when it's not in use (we have a toddler seat that has several pieces and our daughter likes to take it apart more than sit on it).  It is nice and low so the baby's feet can touch the floor even when she's very small.  The inexpensive price is also great for trying it out.  The only criticism I have is that it tends to slide on a wood or tile floor, so I place it on a hand towel.  I also wish they made a clear plastic version so I could see when my baby ""goes.""",1
"I decided to get these when my baby started on iron supplement and her poop got less solid. They are a dream come true. I researched several kinds of liners prior to deciding on these.Pros:- They work really well. First of all the size was pretty impressive. They fit whatever kinds of prefolds or liners that I use, no matter how long they are. Sometimes I pull them lengthwise (ever so slightly) to elongate if I need to. These could easily work on newborns by cutting them in half (yes, they are that big).-They are actually strong enough to hold the poop. We no longer get stains on our diapers. It is easy to lift these off with the poop and flush them down the toilet. We have never had any kind of problems with flushing them.-They are unscented, which we like.Cons:When the baby pees a large amount, they can leave a bunch of lint on her skin, which is easy to clean though, while changing her diaper. This has happened mostly when she has had her diaper on for a while after peeing such as when she pees during her afternoon nap.",1
exactly as pictured  matches the rest of the room perfectly  nice size for a close up picture  I love them,1
"I had never heard of Lansinoh  so I did a little research.  turns out they have been around for about 30 years and their focus is on feeding utensils that help with breastfeeding. BPA free of course. The shape of the bottle is really nice, less likely to slip in your hand.",1
"I love these, my son loves these, it's a win win.  I can attach his toys to his car seat, stroller, etc, so he doesn't drop them and he can chew on their them and enjoy their texture.  Everyone wins.  I wish that they were a bit stronger though as the gaps seem to be getting wider everyday.",0
"Nursing was really messy for me, with milk spraying everywhere.  I used this on top of my boppy or breast friend to protect the pillow.  Unfortunately when you are nursing every 2.5 hours, you need 10 of these a day and with the price, I couldn't but enough of them.  I had to use hand towels the rest of the time so my baby wasn't lying on old milk smelling pads.  I took away one star for price.",1
"My daughter loves it, it fits her well, and I really like the elastic cup holders (which is why I picked this seat over others). They hold a much bigger array of drinks than the dinky little round plastic sort. Juice box, anyone?",1
"We have always been a Britax and Recaro family. Love those seats. But when my 40# 2yr old outgrew his Roundabout and was so heavy that picking himup to get him into the Marathon was a chore I started looking for a 65# harnessed alternative. ( We have the Recaro Young sport but it only harnesses to 40#) After much research and checking them out at the store I found this seat. It is wonderful and my son loves it. He can get in & out easily and loves the cup holder, which is far better than any cup holder on any seat I've used. The only thing that I wish they'd change is the front buckle doesn't have an attachment to keep it from falling back. So when he gets in the seat he is usually sitting on the buckle so I have to dig it out from under him. A minor inconvenience for such a good seat at such a great price.",1
"This is a very heavy package and both times it was delivered by UPS, the box was severely damaged and gouged...my guess is that it was a result of the box being so heavy that people couldn't handle it properly (it's all particle board...very heavy!). Anyway, the first time, the damage was so bad that it actually ruined a couple pieces of the bookshelf so we had to return the whole thing. The second time, the bookshelf wasn't damaged thank goodness even though there was a huge gouge in the box.Anyway, we opened it and started putting it together. It wasn't too difficult but I would say some of the pieces are somewhat cheaply made and when we were trying to connect a couple pieces to each other, one of the metal screws broke. This resulted in the unit not being put together completely perfectly (there's a small space between two of the wood pieces now that is a bit annoying). Also, there are a few shelves that are basically built in and a few that sort of slide in after the unit is put together. Well, the ones that slide in are just a bit shorter in width than the built in ones which again is just a little annoying to the eye. I'm kind of OCD though so this may not bother most people.All in all, I really am pleased with the overall look of this unit but there are some things that could be improved.",1
"Bought this to use with out 9 month old son.  The old plastic one we had wasn't working very well anymore.  He would cry in his old one because it was uncomfortable.  This one is great.  He is comfortable in it, loves to be in it too.  The only problem we have found is that is slips in it easily.  Not that we don't keep a constant eye on him anyway in the tub but you really have to be right there incase he slips and goes into the water face first now.  We don't use the front pockets though because as you will know yourself if you have a little one they enjoy grabbing anything other than their own bath toys.  What ever bright person though it would be convenient for parents to have these on the front in babies line of sight must not have ever bathed a baby before.  For these reasons I give it a 4 star.",1
"This bra in concept seems great but they incorrectly advertise that it works with all double pumps which is not entirely true.  I have the Avent twin pump, and the bra kept creating issues with the suction of the pump.  The bra would cause the petals to come off of the horn, which is what created the issue.  When I contacted the manufacturer for suggestions, they said I would have to either remove the petals or purchase different petals in order for it to work.  I tried pumping without the petals and it didn't feel comfortable.  I ended up returning this bra and used the rubber band trick with my existing nursing bras, which worked a lot better.",0
"We have no complaints other than we should've gotten the bigger size.  We make this size work for holding 12 Dr. Brown bottles (including all their inside bits), but it would be nice to have more space.  If space is a big concern on your countertop, then definitely get this smaller one knowing that you can easily pile up a lot of stuff on it.  But if you have room for the bigger one I'd definitely treat yourself to it.  Overall, the rack is cute and you can prop just about anything on it securely.  We even store the syringe that we use for our son's gas drops on it.",1
"I love using the Medela bottles with the Medela Pump in Style Advanced, they attach directly to the pump and the nipples attach directly to the bottles! Excellent, easy to use and also easy to clean!",1
Appears to work well.  It is nice to not have to worry about ice packs and taking them in or out.  Just put the bag in the freezer and use when needed.,1
"We love this monitor!! Reserched and researched before finally deciding on Foscam digital baby monitor. You really are getting way more then you are paying for. Every feature works good. Video quality is good enough. Not like HD TV like some people seem to expect to get from a baby monitor. I was not expecting that but I did want to be able to see everything clearly and I was not disappointed at all! I've had this camera running for a couple weeks now and it works flawlessly.  As far as long term, I will update but I feel good about this unit lasting. Love it. Highly recommend",1
"Beautiful, hand made product. My baby loves this simple good old fashioned made in the USA toy. Makes a great baby shower gift.",1
"I originally had another carrier when I had my son, I hated it. I was a pain to put on and it gave me a back ache, when I was pregnant with my second child I bought this one and I love it!! I wair it every time that I go grocery shopping and it is wonderful. I can safely take my daughter in and out and carry her around without feeling like I'm going to drop her. Since it adjusts in severel different places I can adjust it correctly and I don't get a back ache. It's a must have for any mother who wants to hold her baby and still be hands free!!",1
"I received a SwaddleMe as a gift.  The first problem I discovered was that even with the small size I had received that when I wrapped it around my son, the velcro pieces didn't meet.  In other words, the wrap was too large.  I attached the velcro at the tightest position possible but my son still managed to squeeze his little arms out the neck - not a pretty sight. The next problem I ran into is that while the bottom of the wrap is supposed to support the baby's feet like a womb, my son out of frustration to get out of it would just bust the bottom completely out so that his legs were completely exposed.  In fact, he tore the velcro that secures the bottom pouch to the top.  A friend recommended the Miracle Blanket and although it looks like a straightjacket it works and he has never busted out of it.  It is one size fits all because of its design which is helpful as well.",0
This was Less expensive the other  baby floor gyms. My son likes the patterns when he's on his tummy and I like that it doesn't have big doofy fisherprice looking characters on it.,1
This is the second one I bought. The first one broke the first week and the second one broke 3 months later. I gave up and bought a different brand.,0
"I cannot begin to tell you how many times this little thing has saved us from a kid's meltdown.We'd fill one container with one kind of snack, another container with another, and so on and so on (variety).  It was a very good thing to have for the toddler.Now for the baby, we found this idea pretty good.  If we were going on a long airplane ride or a long road trip or just out all day, we'd pre-fill each of the little containers with cereal or oatmeal (dry) and close them up.  We'd also throw a bottle of water (or milk) in the baby bag.  When it came time to eat, we just opened one of the containers, poured the liquid in, and voila! You have a meal prepared with no immediate cleanup (it's its own bowl, too!).  You have these pre-packaged meals for the kid all ready to go, and when you get to your destination, you can rinse them out.  They close up when done and it's just so. darn. perfect.",1
This does a fine job of keeping the oven door locked.  Adhesive seems to be solid.  Nothing to complain about.,1
"We used this diaper pail and thought it was great...at first.  Our son is now 9 months old and the smell from the dirty diapers has permeated the plastic and now it always stinks.  We tried deo disks, baking powder, carpet cleaning powder, pine-sol, plug-in right over it...but nothing has worked.  We even tried putting each messy diaper in one of the sassy bags and that helps with the new scents but nothing will get rid of the old.  May work well if you use the scented bags for each diaper combined with this from the very beginning.  And to whoever said that baby poo doesnt smell bad...just wait...it will :)",0
"I use this daily and love it. I was given the duck thermometer at my shower and hate it, used it once and threw it away. I recently purchased another  turtle meter for a friend.",1
"I'm 5'5"" and wear a size 10, and this carrier was not comfortable for me or my son. Even when tightened all the was, the straps still seemed too long, and while wearing my son on my back, he seemed to ""hang"". Carrying him in the front was better, but not much. I'm returning this and trying something else.",0
It's a pretty cool item and helps when you are in the middle of doing things around the house or on the go and the baby needs to feed. Just make a bottle and hook the bottle holder and my baby is comfy drinking milk whether on the bouncer or in the stroller. 4 stars only because it falls over every now and then but that's when the baby is sleepy. Other than that I'm glad to have it.,1
"This item does whats its suppose to do, i guess if you have a surprise massage its fine lol lol",0
Purchased two of these rails for a twin bed that can't be pushed against the wall. My three year old son loves the design of his rails. The rails stay in place and are sturdy enough to hold when he leans against them. Would recommend.,1
Bought this for my 2 and 5 year old grandchild.  The 5 year old loved it and so did the adults.  The 2 year old was a little freaked out.  It truly is a flying monkey that screams when it lands....hours of fun for ages 5 to adult.,1
I haven't seen the product but my friend I had it shipped to seems to like it.. it looks to be cute..,1
My son loves going on walks but the stroller that came with our travel system rattled too much on the street. This stroller is perfect for long walks. My son loves the smooth ride. It is very convenient to be able to move the seat back... perfect for when my son falls asleep during the walks. This stroller is durable and very easy to maneuver.,1
"I apparently have ""flat"" nipples and had trouble breastfeeding my first child.  This time, I attended a breastfeeding class and it was recommended that I start wearing SoftShells around 34 weeks to ""draw out"" my nipples.  They are perfectly comfortable, but that's probably because I can only wear them around the house.  They are SUPER obvious under clothing; the outer dome is hard plastic (not Soft, as the name may imply).  I think it's helping, but I won't know for sure until my little one arrives.",0
"It cost a dollar.., I can't complain to much. I got what I payed for here although it serves its purpose. Item is made out of a strange Styrofoam like substance that easily tears. this item is adjustable and comes with buttons located on the back.",0
The Baby Bjorn One is great for both newborns and older kids. You can carry the child in both front of back and it even offers a neck support which is great for newborns but it can be folded down for older kids. It does weight more and is a little more difficult to get on than the original Baby Bjorn Overall the One is definitely an upgrade from the original and we love it!,1
"My daughter has absolutely loved this product. However, 16 days AFTER warranty ended the projector as well as the night light  completely stopped working. Because of that, and returning the item for replacement not being an option, I would not recommend this product.",0
This high chair performed just like I expected. The fabric is removeable and simple to launder. Wiping daily with a wet cloth works fine between washings. Our baby loved this chair and it pulled up to our table nicely. The adjustable heights were nice. We folded it up often to stand it in the corner when not in use.,1
"This is one of my son's favorite toys and one of mine, too.  It's cheap, quiet, great for teething, portable, and can entertain him through an hour long church service.  Can't really ask for much more!",1
"We have a 4 door Honda Civic and 3 boys; 6, 3, and new born. We couldn't fit 3 car seats in our car. We bought the BubbleBum for our oldest and he loves it. We can fit all three boys in the back of our Honda Civic and still have room to go camping.",1
"We got these bibs because: we love how easy they are to slip over the head, the baby cannot pull them off, and they cover her entire shirt front from getting dirty with food. My only complaint is that one of the bibs ripped around the collar seem the first time they were washed.",0
very poor quality...it can't steam after using for few times only.  The steam and blend mode was out of funtion at the beginning.  regret to buy it. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,0
This is perfect. It was really hard to find a round shaped fitted sheet for a bassinet mattress. This one is perfect. I love that its organic and the little bird decal is sweet as well. I ordered two! This is the best bassinet sheet I found!,1
"I have purchased two of these for my daughter's bedroom hamper.  The first one lasted a bit longer, but the second one had a handle break the first time we picked it up with clothes inside.  The price and design are good, however.",0
"I got this for my daughter. She said it works great! She uses it for errands, much easier than pulling out the stroller.",1
"Bought this for darling son when we were planning a trip to WDW and I didn't want to deal with carrying bibs around. I thought this would be easy to pack and then just use the restaurant's napkins, etc. as the actual bib. The problem is, Darling Son was 22 months, and this thing wouldn't even get CLOSE go around his neck in the way the picture shows....and he's a normal size kid, not a giant! Ended up never being able to use it and it went to the Goodwill. In my opinion, if the child is big enough to sit up and eat (and therefore need this) then it is likely too small to fit that child.",0
"I think I received a returned item. Still, I like the gate and I've been using it for 6 months.  I purchased this mainly for looks and not much of the features (1 - it works as a baby gate 2 - you have to push in and down a button to open the gate 3 - its held by tension).This gate is installed between 2 stairway banister posts.  I contemplated purchasing the stairway banister post adapters but decided to make my own.  I purchased 8' cedar 1.5&#34;x1&#34; strip at my nearby Menards.  Cut it to length and stained to match my posts.  I cut it so that it would come level with the bottom of the ball at the top of the post.  Next, I screwed the tension feet cups to the wood strips (this is important for the top as the banister post does not provide a tension point near the top) and did the same for the bottom (for uniformity).  Next, I secured the gate between the banister and wood strips.  Using conduit c-clamps that was screwed to the wood strips and secured to the banister with zip ties.  I used black zips to blend but its still noticeable.  It's a trade-off between secure and non-damaging to the home vs. looks (remember, I have 3 kids and they make a daily mess of the house).I made sure that the tension was tight and the gate was secure to my satisfaction.  I was surprised that the gate opened very easily and after a short while (instructions were not in the box) I figured that the top of the gate had to be expanded (i.e. more tension) to close the gap across the top of the gate and frame.  Later I found out this was by design and not a defect of the item I received.Now its works great as a stairway gate.",1
Everything I expected. Super warm material that doesn't pill. Worth every penny. I wear it around the house as much as I do outdoors.,1
"Buddy Bear is huggable and very soft.  My grandson was just born on Sat. 9/5/11 so he won't be playing with the bear for awhile.  It is very cute and I know he will love it.  It seems well made and if it is anything like the one I got my granddaughter 4 1/2 years ago it will last a long, long time.  She still loves ""Pops"" and plays with him all the time.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a cute bear to give to a child.",1
"The HydroGel pads cools upon contact, however, the cooling sensation dissipates rapidly. I only wish the cooling sensation lasted longer.",0
"We live in a rural area, and share a lane with our neighbor who lives behind us. Our neighbor's friends like to use the lane like a drag strip, and we have two young sons who love to play outside. Not a great combination. I bought this cone to alert visitors that my children are outside, and that they need to slow down to a reasonable speed and have their eyes open as they drive past. Its been wonderful. I've seen many a visitor slow down or even stop and look for kids before driving past! Serves its purpose well!My only complaint is that it is very lightweight, so you have to put a big rock or brick in it to keep it in place, or it will blow away on a windy day.",1
These were the perfect bag to give as favors at my daughter's third birthday party; I put a new Curious George book in each along with one of those &#34;mini&#34; bananas.  Festive and fun and nicely sized to hold the books!,1
"For some reason, I was expecting this to zip (QuickZip) or have some other method of sticking to the bed, which it does not have.  But it is an okay mattress pad and stays in place pretty well under a fitted sheet.",0
My 1.5 year old loves these. They don't have the small magnet like her previous ones which were not safe for chewers. The magnet is the entire back and the front is not just paper so it can withstand chewing. The animals and colours are great.,1
Our little girl loves this playgym.  She is now 2 1/2 months old and loves to lay under and watch the lights...she also bats at the toys hanging down and goes crazy when she actually hits them:)  It keeps her attention for about 15-30 minutes at a time...nice to be able to get some things done:)  Would definitely recommend this product!!,1
"I started my son on Dr. Brown's wide neck bottles which he always liked and did really well with but by the time he was about 6 months old I was so sick of hand-washing (no dishwasher) all those pieces that i started looking for alternatives.  Unfortunately, my son didn't want anything to do with any of the other bottles i tried.  I tried all different types including Avent but my little man was not having it.  I finally tried Bebek (now evenflo) and he didn't even seem to notice they were different bottles, the nipple is exactly the same size and softness.Bebek used to have a slightly different style of bottle that was more boring looking but personally i liked better and the cap wasn't such a pain to put on like these new ones are but i own and still use both styles.  They're terrific bottles especially if you're sick of washing dr. brown's.",1
"I bought these 9oz bottles because I was pleased with he 5oz bottles I used previously.  Be aware, even though the picture shows packages with slow flow nipples, they come with medium flow nipples.  I actually wanted medium flow and bought extra because I thought these came with slow flow.",1
"I purchased this bag for the day care teachers' to put my potty training toddler's soiled clothes (instead of using disposable plastic bags). This bag is perfect! It is waterproof, large enough to hold a days worth of toddler size 4 shorts & undies, and it's machine washable AND dryable! It holds the odor pretty well--no more torturous drives home with stinky clothes! It's also great for trips to the beach to put wet bathing suits. Definitely recommend. Love the plaid design too!",1
"Let me start by saying that I love the style of this crib and would purchase it again in a heartbeat.  My two small gripes are that the wood shows EVERY nick and scrape (my son also loves &#34;chewing&#34; on the top rail and that looks horrible) and that the mattress height is a major pain to adjust.  You can obviously take steps to prevent the first gripe, but just be ready to set aside some time and roll up your sleeves every few months when you have to adjust the height.  Otherwise, there is no other crib in this price range that looks this modern and this stylish, so the minor annoyances shouldn't stop you from purchasing.",1
stays on table and makes me feel better about my grandson eating on strange tables he loves the colors.and cars,1
"I love Britax car seats, but this was way too big and wide for my old Dodge Caravan.  With a second child in a booster seat, and a third child who's husky, there simply wasn't enough room to accommodate all three kids on the 3 person bench. The standard Britax Roundabout car seat leaves the other 2 kids with plenty of room.",0
"With great anticipation, I recieved my lamp today that I plan to use in my daughter's nursery. It's just what I expected via the picture however I was very dissappointed after opening the box to find no ribbon! After reviewing the product description I realize that it doesn't specify ribbon included. Buyer beware and pay attention; although the ribbon makes the lamp if you order from Amazon you won't be given the option of ordering with the ribbon.",1
this is a wonderful way to store baby food. the cubes are the right size and becasue they are individual containers they are very portable...great for sending baby food to daycare. as our baby has grown we have combined a couple of cubes to make inventive mixes for our baby. its also a great way to carry around cheerios and other snacks.,1
"No more food thrown in the car :)  Its perfect for my sons little hands, he carries it everywhere.  Very durable",1
"I purchased these and some of the cheaper alva brand pocket diapers. The alva's were horrible but that's for another review. Baby as born at 7lbs, and i found these to still be a little too big around her legs the first 2-3 weeks. She is now just about to hit 8 weeks and they are too big (haven't been to the dr so don't know her exact weight :/). They fit well under NB clothes, a little bulky, but definitely worth it. I found the prefolds to be easy and stay in place well.  change her every 2-2.5 hours and had no problems with leaking. I am writing this review as i'm looking to purchase a kit for the next size. Worth it even for a part time CD user like we are.",1
"Our 9 month old has had this on basically all of her life.  She seems to sleep better with the white noise.  That's really the only thing that we use, but it works well and it has a very large range for volume.  All of the options work well, and eventually we may use the projector as well.  The blue night like works well to, though we don't really need it, it would come in handy if we did.  Recommend it to anyone!",1
It wasn't listed on amazon that this is really just up to 9 month size so luckily my 15 month old is on the smaller side so this still works for her. We use it as an extender for her overnight diaper and so far so good.Probably won't be able to use it much longer.,1
"Sent me a faucet cover instead...so I can't say much about the actual product.  Keeping the cover as I will need it eventually, but that means I paid an extra $2 for it.",0
"My girlfriend absolutely loves it. I wanted to wait to have our baby before reviewing, and now that we're using it everyday, I can finally say that it's a great product. Tons of pockets and space, great fashion design.Only reason it's not 5 stars is that there is not really any easy way to attach it to the stroller. There should be one little clip/strap on each side to attach to the stroller like I have on my diaper dude bag... So to put it under the handles you have to just ""hang"" it there by the shoulder strap but it's not ideal.",1
The Cacalo Ellie Sherpa Blanket is an adorable soft blanket.  This blanket will go well with the matching Ellie fitted sheets.  The whole set is very inexpensive and the quality is great.,1
"I bought this because even though my breast are larger I apparently dont have big nipples and needed the smaller fit. I don't know if most of the population had gigantic nipples, but I was not able to find these in the store at all, yet they did stock the large and extra large. This fit was more appropriate for me, but I wish that the actual part that fits over the breast was a little larger,",1
"I have heard a lot about this so I decided to try it for my little one.  So far, so good!",1
Easy to assemble and keeps our 10-month old grandbaby happy for a little while.  He is very active and plays with a number of the &#34;toys&#34; with gusto. Not as many features as some other exersaucers and two of them on this unit need batteries ... which I chose not to  install.  Our little guy definitely loves the bouncing feature -- the springs do make the bouncing more fun.,1
These were impossible to install.  We ended up returning them.  My husband builds his own furniture and is very handy with tools.  He could not get these to work if his life depended on it.,0
"Yes, this carrier already has tons of 5-star reviews--and it deserves another.I resisted buying it at first because of the $$$ pricetag, but our six-week-old would only fall asleep while being held or carried. Our hand-me-down Bjorn hurt my back and she couldn't settle in the Moby wrap. I finally bought it three weeks ago, and it has already been worth every penny. At first she would squall for a while when I put her in it, but now she's so used to falling asleep in it that she settles down almost immediately. On bad nights I've even resorted to propping myself up and falling asleep while wearing her, although I'm pretty sure that's not a recommended use. It's great outside the house, too. By now, popping her in it is as a quick as getting the car seat onto the stroller, so I take it on all our errands.Everything about it is well designed. The cover is great for sun protection, sleeping, keeping grubby hands off of our infant, and protecting her little head from ice cream and salsa drippings. I stash keys, pacis, and my wallet in the zip pocket. Everything is easily adjustable, so my husband can use it too.The infant insert, however, is not worth the money. It's a clever solution, and the baby seemed nice and cozy in it, but I found it too bulky and awkward for daily use. Instead, I wrap up my baby, put a folded burp cloth in the bottom of the carrier, and seat her sideways. Everything snugs up to keep her nice and secure. Sometimes I put her in facing me with her legs frogged up, but we both like the sidesaddle better.Highly, highly recommended.",1
"It's made of the same fabric some of those cheaper throws are made of, so the material ends up wearing in the same fashion. It's a really cute pillow; the only problem I have with it(and the whole line) is that the arms are sewn into the body/legs to the point where they cannot be separated.My son enjoys it, because he likes everything Yo Gabba Gabba. I use it as a bumper in case he wabbles walking/crawling/sitting.",1
"We have been using this highchair for our son for about 6 months now.  It is a wonderful product!  The fabric is EXTREMELY easy to clean, just needs a wet paper towel.  Love the double trays that can be removed.  This is a great option if I don't have time between meals to clean one layer of the tray and want a clean area for my son to eat.  We love the adjustable levels.  Fits perfectly under our granite counter top on our island bar, great height for our dining room table, and also great to take into the living room and feed my son while sitting on the couch.  So many uses!  High chair was not complicated to put together, took about 10 minutes and in baby toys(stuff) that is nothing!  Love, love, love this product and would buy again and again.",1
What more can you ask for...we needed a step stool for my son AND it has the Yankee logo! Win-Win situation!,1
"I so wanted to love this travel crib, but I just can't. After copious amount of research I purchased the Lotus (at the hefty $200 price point) for a trip to visit family alone with my 8-month-old that involved flying. This thing seemed like the perfect solution since it was compact enough to fit in an overhead storage bin. The compact size is the ONLY thing I ended up liking about it. Below are my major disappointments and reasons I am selling it after about 4 months of use:- velcro straps take forever to thread through the base to secure the mattress and sheet (all while hunched over at a very uncomfortable angle since you have to have one arm in and one are out of the crib to do it).- the mattress DOES NOT LIE FLAT once the sheet is over it. It pulls the mattress to a point that baby has to lie on it (uncomfortably I'm sure) to flatten it out, and even then it still pulls up on the ends. I have no idea how they got it to lie flat with the sheet on it in the product picture. Mine will not do this.I find myself envious of my friends' bulkier pack 'n plays because they are SOOO much easier to assemble and take apart and their babies look so much more comfortable in them. For the $200 price tag, the lotus should have a more efficient assembly and the mattress should lie flat!!",0
Bought this for my car so that my wife and i can alternate taking and picking up our child from day care.Works just like the one that comes with the b-safe car seat. No complaints!,1
very good price and works good for my kid. still using it now after baby is 9 months. love it.,1
My 3 1/2 year old daughter sleeps in a queen sized bed. As we try to wean her from pull-ups there are always a few accidents and this cover has not let any moisture through to the mattress.  It was a great buy!,1
"While the toy box looks good once it is assembled, it took my husband 6 hours and it still is not totally put together.  The hardware was cheap and broke and pieces were wrong, had to drill.  We didn't have it ready to take to our grandson's 1st Birthday party.  Not the end of the world but something like this should take so long to put together.  It should have been a snap with good hardware and the right pieces.  He had to go to the hardware store 2 times.  ugh...",0
Did not receive all items listed in description. Baby bath was not the one in the picture. Not satisfied. Disappointed.,0
"These tiles are wonderful! I bought them when we first started physical therapy for my daughter. Her ability to sit independently is limited and she often falls over. We wanted something to help cushion the falls and would allow her toys (ones that roll) to be used as well. I researched several other brands and these were the thickest ones I could find. They are GREAT! The stay together very well, are soft enough that even adults are comfortable sitting on the floor, and have provided peace of mind for those unexpected tumbles. I highly recommend this companies floor tiles! I know they are a bit pricier than other versions, but are well worth the extra expense. I was given some of the thinner ones and they are not comfortable and don't provide enough cushioning.",1
"I purchased these prior to a 5 hour plane ride with my son.  They came in handy to distract him and play with.  He is 14 months old.  He hasn't played with them much other than that, but they were a perfect quiet toy for the plane.",0
"I bought these Ronrono deglingo's for my friends baby girl for her 1st birthday. After reading the reviews I decided to order a bigger size because other reviews said they run on the small size. I'm glad I did! They would have been too small if I would have ordered her ""regular"" size. For a girl that just turned one year old, the size 18-24 months fit her great. She loves them by the way--can't take her hands off them!",1
"Absolutely love this stroller!! Was looking at a city select stroller at first, then find this one and couldn't pass up the price and I'm glad I didn't! my kids are two and one and they love it too!",1
"I was really nervous about taking my daughter on a plane because she is a very difficult eater and it's usually a fight getting her to eat, so my search to make the plane ride easier was on. A friend of ours gave us this product before she was born and I thought it wasn't a very good idea. Then yesterday I took it out of the box and gave it a try. She downed 8oz in 15min(it would usually take about 45min-1hr to finish)!! I can't believe I didn't try this sooner! I mean, it does take a while to wash and at first the formula wasn't coming out so well. I tried taking it apart and jamming the tubes in harder, but then I realized that the part that screws into the nipple lid needs to be really tight so there isn't any air. Then, BOOM, no problems! I am now confident to take her on ANY plane. I am definitely one happy momma :)Now for the reviews on smaller babies, I wouldn't know. My baby is 4 months and has always been a great sucker. Although when I tested it, I didn't have to suck that hard for the formula to come through(yes, it tested it. I needed to make sure it would work!)I would recommend this to EVERYONE. Even if they didn't have a baby lol.",1
my 1 and 4 year old love this bath toy!  My one year old drink a lot of bath water because of the little cup...but he really loves that there is on going water coming down.  my 4 year old is also mesmerized by this toy and play with little cars or figures along with this toy.,1
"I bougth for my 2 years old girl she love and me too, you can washes so many times and still like new",1
"We have had these since our son was 2 weeks old. He may not have fully appreciated them at that age but they have certainly kept him entertained on many car rides and shopping trips over his 7 young months.  The rattly, bobbly crinkly bee is his favorite but we have at least one of them attached at all times to the handle on his car seat (Chicco KeyFit 30) so they are within easy reach.  I haven't put them on our Chicco Cortina stroller yet because 1) J is still usually in the car seat and 2) I can't quite see how to attach them anywhere useful for him on the stroller. Anyone have any ideas? They do attach nicely to the front bar on our Phil & Teds stroller tho.Would have given 5* if there were more attachment options.",1
I got this after reading a mom blog that mentioned it. It works sooo much better than a baby nail clippers! I ordered several to give as gifts and an extra one for me so I always have one close by. I would HIGHLY recommend it to everyone who has a baby in the family!!,1
"I like how large and wide of a view this mirror gives us, and it's big enough for baby to notice as well. There's a two-part harness that attaches to the headrest, but it loosens a bit easily when handled too much or when large items in the trunk cargo area jostles the attachments from behind.Otherwise, great mirror!",1
"I purchased this for my daughter for when my grandson arrives in June. She would love to carry him around with her while she does housework, shopping or just to get the feel of wearing one of these. I wish I had one when my kids was babies.",1
"It's pretty small and the reflection is distorted. I wouldn't recommend it for keeping a close eye on a passenger, but it is good for a quick glance.",0
"Our daughter loves to be rocked and bounced to sleep (at the same time, so the rocking chair only works part of the time). After a couple of weeks of taking turns, our knees were DONE! We got the swing hoping it would satisfy her. It actually didn't work when she was fussy and tired, BUT it works great the rest of the time. She naps in it and hangs out with her older siblings in it. She was too small to use the tray when we bought it so we didn't put it on. We can sit up the (very easy to recline) seat so she can see what everyone is doing and she's thrilled. The GREAT thing about it is it takes three BIG (D I think?) batteries. We've used it everyday for three months now - maybe two or three times a day for 5 to 20 minutes at a time unless she falls asleep, then up to two hours...and the batteries have lasted. I just realized today how long it's been. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is that it's really got a big foot print. We have a tiny house. If it weren't for our failing knees, I never would have bought it. I'm glad we did and would recommend it to anyone. The sounds it comes with are a little wierd. But since we didn't even know it had sounds when we bought it, I didn't let that factor into my review. We never use them...the swing by itself is well worth the money we spent and the floor space we've lost!",1
The bowl is fine but I was expecting three as there were three in the picture. I'm sure it says somewhere that there is only one but I didn't spend that much time reading the small print of a plastic bowl......,0
This is a great car seat! It grows with my child. I love the arm rests and cup holder and the soft pillow. The material is nice and soft and not to clean up messes. It reclines which is useful for when they are young but the car seat grows with them.,1
"This car seat is being used in car and has been used 4-5 times when we travel and need one for rental car. We love that is lightweight, the folding portabilty, and even came with a travel bag. My daughter loves the cup holders, and says it is comfortable.",1
"""Excellent"". Just what I expected and in the right time. I bought it to make match the crib set with my toodler  Olive Kids Trains, Planes and Trucks set. Just perfect!",1
"We requested this system for the arrival of our first daughter, Grace, and received it as a baby shower gift. The facet seems to work well for a girl as the blue is more of a turquoise color than a definitive blue (we'd like to keep it for our future children, so we picked the most gender neutral color). Also, my husband said the extra base that is ordered separately is easier to install than the one that comes with the system. Here are the pros and cons as I view them:pros:-This system is easy to figure out, even for someone as mechanically disinclined as myself-The wheels have held up against soft dirt, loose rocks, and bumpy asphalt thus far with no problems-The umbrella on the seat can be moved from up by the head to down by the feet, which is a great help with the sun (the umbrella on the stroller does not do this)-The seat fits in most shopping carts, and even ""locks"" onto some carts as it would in the car seat base-The carryall at the bottom of the stroller is or decent size and has held a backpack on several occasions, as well as a diaper changer, bag of groceries, and a chihuahua on another occasion-The compartment on the top of the stroller is large enough to hold my wristlet/wallet-The car seat itself is curved on the bottom, so you can literally rock your child while he/she is in it-It's pretty easy to maneuver with one hand-When the seat is in the stroller, there's a space at the foot-end of the seat that is big enough for a purse-When the seat is in the stroller, the umbrella from the stroller and the umbrella from the seat nearly fold over one another, which makes it dark for her to sleep in and protects her well from the suncons:-Like the other review said, neither the seat nor the stroller is padded very well. I have been experimenting with different towels/etc in an attempt to pad the seat. She is unable to stay in the seat for longer than 1-2 hours and will start crying; I then take her out and carry her, which can be difficult when I am out running errands. Because of this discomfort, she has quite a bit of difficulty sleeping in the seat. The padding is the hard foam one would find encompassing a fragile item inside a box, and the seat covers are no more than 1/4"" thick at best.-I don't believe that the stroller has shocks- if it does, they are very poor-Unfolding the stroller takes two hands. Try as I might, I am unable to unfold it with one (folding, however, only takes one hand)-When the seat is placed on a shopping cart, the height of the seat is often higher than my head and I have bumped into a couple of people in the motorized disability shopping carts because I did not see them-I could not find the instruction manual on the website (perhaps that was just me though)Overall, I am fairly pleased with this purchase and will be more pleased once I am able to make the seat more comfortable for my daughter. I give it a 4 out of 5.",1
"So this product just broke again for the second time in 9 months.  My daughter is 9 months old and loves this mobile.  After the first 3 months, the piece that attaches the music dial to the mobile broke.  I love the style of Skip Hop, so contacted the company and was content when they sent me a new mobile.  But now it has happened a second time.  I am very careful to hold the base of the music dial while I turn it, and it still managed to break again.  My daughter is not at a stage to be able to move from the crib sides to the mobile, so I know for certain it is not her pulling on the mobile.  I am completely disappointed in Skip Hop at this time.  I have a lot of their other products e.g. their playyard and play mat and they tend to get pilly right away.  Love the style, but don't think they are very well made.",0
"I purchased this kit to make a belly cast during my first pregnancy. I am a bigger girl, so I actually bought 2 to make sure I had enough strips. I'm going to now return one full kit because there was PLENTY of strips in just one of the kits.It was very easy to do. My husband wet the strips as I stood there. They recommend sitting, but I thought it would look funny, so I stood. The strips dry fairly quickly, so it wasn't that bad.I wanted to make sure I was almost as big as I was going to get, so I waited until 38 weeks to do mine. It turned out beautifully! This is such an easy kit! I also suggest looking to see if warehousedeals.com has it. This is Amazon.com's warehouse discount site. I bought both of mine on there. The only thing was the box was a bit damaged, but who cares!It would be difficult to do this one by yourself though. You need a partner/helper to apply the strips. Partners/spouses like it because they get to see you with your top off (if you include the breast portion of your body), and it's a great keepsake. Fun for all involved!I'll recommend this to anyone and I'm sure with my next bundle of joy, I'll use this brand also. Great kit & great fun.",1
"I ordered this for my daughter on Feb 8 and it arrived at our door step on Feb 11th. We were so excited that we put it together right away and put her in it...immediately she figured out that putting her hands on the buttons made sounds and she loved it. Her eyes were filled with wonder as she inquisitively explored the various toys. Everytime we put her in it she'll spend the first 5 mins playing with the toys. Once she's had enough of it then will she look up and look for us & tries to move around. Because she is only 3.5 months old & her feet don't quite touch the floor completely even at the lowest setting so we padded the adjustable component with rolled up cardboard so that the walker sits lower to the floor just a bit more for her feet to reach. (We put a good amount of weight to the test to make sure the card board would not give into the weight since we would not want the walker to all of a sudden fold down while she's in it...we eventually replaced the cardboard with a paint stick) We've probably put her in it a hand full of times, and yesterday she actually walked in it!! We couldn't believe that a 3.5 months old was roaming the house in this walker. We have hardwood floor on the whole first floor so she'd slide around very easily, we'd have to rescue her whenever she runs into the corner of the wall and puts herself in timeout though. But even when that happens she just plays with the toys when she's stuck. She loves this and we'd highly recommend it. 6/18/08 Update: she is now 7 months and is already trying to walk. She climbs everything in sight and grabs hold and stands...I can't help but think if she is so advanced for her age because we started her off in this walker very early on and therefore she had a full grasp of the concept of walking and moving around. Needless to say from 3.5-7 months, she enjoyed the walker immensely, and it gave both her and I so~ much freedom. She would fly around the house estatic, and mastered reversing and turning quickly. Now at 7 months and standing, she is not as interested in sitting in this walker so I'm on a search for something that will continue to give her the independence to explore and learn with little or no help from me...maybe the ""walking wings"" next?!?",1
You cannot beat the price of this jumper and it is worth every penny!  I love that it's pretty basic and not too much of an eye sore since it lives in the center of our house because our son loves it so much.  I can easily move it from one doorway to the next if I need and it gives me time to actually cook or clean!  I looked at several jumpers and landed on this one because of the great reviews - I was not disappointed!,1
"People make fun of me for getting a helmet for my baby.However its such a peace of mind that I don't care,it has save us from a lot of crying and possible runs to the doctor.The ears are very cute and the helmet is made of good quality materials.The only down size is that makes my baby's head quite hot.I also got the ""NO Shock"" helmet from OKBABY a italian company.Its ligther ans fits smaller heads.I don't thing you should use the helmet on the baby ALL the time,but when and you are by yourselve is a great help.",1
"My daughter who is almost exclusively breastfed only takes to these bottles with medium flow nipples. They have a cute design and are by far the easiest bottles to clean. However, I just found out that Amazon overpriced these 8 oz bottles. At Target online, you can get the exact same thing for only 23.99+tax. Too bad I already sterilized all the bottles. At least next time I know where to go for replacements.",1
"My favorite gift for a baby shower or newborn gift.  It may not be the most useful gift, but it provides an endearing memory item.",1
What a nice sheet this is. The material is so soft for the baby and the sheet fit is perfect. We will be ordering another because we are so pleased with this one,1
"I recieved this tub as a gift at my shower. The first time I went to use it, I was alone with the baby. I put the baby in the tub and water started pouring out from the hinges. It was horrible. I tried it again and it did the same thing, even with a tiny amount of water. Please, don't waste your money.",0
my little boy loves this stool!  it's sturdy and he can move it around easily to put it where he wants.,1
"This color is reddish, but it's a deep cherry.  It still looks very dark.  And I was okay with a little highlight of cherry and was prepared for it based on other reviews.  Super easy to put together.  I did it myself 7 months pregnant in 30 min.  Solid, sturdy, beautiful!  Exactly what I wanted.  Arrived in great condition.  I haven't used with a baby yet.... I will try to remember to update review later once it is lived in.",1
"If this tape is double sided, i don't know where the second side is. The foam is nice and cushiony, if only i could use it. I don't know how this tape is going to work with the foam. If and when we figure it out, i will update my review",0
"This is one nice mobile (the actual name of it is Fisher-Price Rainforest Friends Musical Mobile) - with all the bells and whistles.It is made out of heavy duty plastic and has a very substantial feel to it. It fastens to the side of baby's crib, with the mobile hanging and spinning above, until baby is big enough to grab hold of it. Then the mobile detaches and a kangaroo musical nightlight is left, playing music or white noise, and serving as a nightlight.The monkey, lion and elephant figures are very cute and brightly colored. One negative - I never did see much use in the ""funhouse"" mirrors put on children's toys. Are our children supposed to think that's what they look like? Music, white noise, light, movement - all come together for baby's entertainment and help for baby's caregiver.It was easy to put together, very intuitive. I do wish it had come with the three ""C"" batteries included, at least short-life demo ones. And I'm glad there is a volume control for the music/white noise features.",1
"I have square-ish bowls and this didn't fit, but I bought a couple round just for it, so worth it! The bottom actually sticks to his high chair! I know I could of bought plastic bowls but they scratch and keep bacteria! Bought two more at a store as they were on sale defiantly worth it if you have a toddler like mine who lovessss to throw his food dishes!",1
This is a great toy that encouranges interest and strengthens kicking with good visual motor skills coordination.  Babies love this and it keeps them content.,1
I have been using this for about 2 months since my baby was born and it has been a great buy. I was about to purchase one of those expensive ones for about $100 but decided to give this one a try and it has been worth it.,1
While we finally wore out our old ones was looking for a close match and these fill the bill while not as soft as our older ones.  I can see that they would fill the bill for babies as well.,1
"We bought this for our 2 year old daughter (she turns 2 in 5 days)! I was worried since this was a booster/convertible car seat it would be too big/advanced/not secure enough (all the factors that go through our mommy brains) but the Recaro Performance Sports Booster conforms to her beautifully, she is SO secure and snug plus very very well protected with the side impact protection pads. I was also worried that the padding wouldn't be as thick because in the picture it does not look as 'thick' as the Recaro Proride car seat but let me tell you I also purchased that one for our 3 month old daughter and they are BOTH relatively the same amount of padding. I was so relieved to get them and see how beautiful the color was in real life, the pink is not so hot pink as it looks in the picture it is a nice soft pink. For the Proride we got the purple color and it is also a very nice deep purple. We had previously the Britax for our 2 yr old and In comparison to buckling and pulling the straps tight or loosening it is basically the same set up (you push down the little lever/button in the same spot on front of car seat just like the britax) but I would have to say the Recaro feels smoother to me. They are virtually the same in the aspect of getting them buckled but it feels easier to do so. In comparison to the Sport and Proride the only major difference I see which may be a factor for you is the strap protection piece for there neck is sewn into or part of the straps on the Sport seat and are removable on the Proride just like the Britax ones.Overall I was trying to debate whether or not to get the Sport or two of the Proride car seats for both of our daughters but I am so happy I chose to get her this Sport booster one for my 2 year old as it conforms to her perfect, she's comfortable and well protected PLUS she can grow with it! And by the time she is out of this, we can move our baby into this one... But that won't be a long ways down the road. I particularly love that these are higher then other car seats as we are not short people. I am 5'9 and my husband is 6'2 so our kids have always been in the 80-90th percentile for height! Happy car seat shopping, you won't be disappointed by this purchase!!! :)",1
"If I had to return all my gifts and keep one, this is the one I would keep.  I got it as a baby-shower gift and have used it until my little one was ready to sleep on her crib at 3 months of age(actually, that's when I was ready to let her go to her crib.. :-).  The co-sleeper was very easy to put together and very simple to attach to our bed.  It was great when my daughter would wake up for her middle-of-the-night feedings.  I would pick her up, feed her and place her back to sleep without ever leaving my bed.  The only thing I was not too thrilled about was the mattress it comes with.  I found it to be a bit hard so I purchased a little pad and cut it to fit.  It worked great!  I highly recommend this item to all mothers, especially if you plan on breasfeeding!  :-)",1
"I've never written a review but Im so frustrated I had to jump on and warn people not by buy these!!! I cant even get one screw in, the heads strip right off, and yes Im just hand tightening them.",0
"Not only do these work great cuz it's a three pack for my triplets, but they really do help keep the cereal off the floor! They are great for breakfast in the morning, snacks in the car, snacks in the wagon. Easy to toss in a bag. Love 'em!",1
"This is a great little potty seat.  Plain and white with a simple design (it doesn't get them used to going potty on a throne) it's easy to keep clean and has an easily removable vessel to make emptying it simple.  I would definitely recommend it.  The only thing I would advise is if you're potty trainee is older, this seat is fairly small.",1
"I love the material, it's nice and soft. I washed them and they still have the softness and quality. Happy with the purchase.",1
"There is much to like about this trainer. The sizing seems accurate, it holds a whole pee and a poop (hate to say it) while many other trainers do not. Plus, with the side-open snaps, changing said poop is less disgusting. But with all that said, there are a few TINY complaints. Because of it's built-in absorbency, it takes forever to air dry. I've always preferred to air dry my PUL lined items, but I gave up on the trainer and tossed it in the dryer. Also, for some reason, maybe the angle of the side snaps, this is very hard for my son to pull up on his own. Now that he's really getting the hang of pottying, this has become more of an issue. Do I recommend it? Sure. But just consider all the points about a trainer with built-in absorbency.",1
"She wants play once a day .she all the things on one tile, she do's like a puzzle.She roll on it.",1
"Love love love love love this product!  I have two very expensive swings, but this product tops them both.  I can bring my newborn with me anywhere in my apartment, and set her on surfaces that are higher up (with supervison obviously).  This was great to have after my C-section when bending over to pick her up was painful.",1
We refinished a dresser for the baby's room and needed a changing tray top. For some reason the only ones we could find were a couple hundred dollars - made no sense. We found this one and ordered it just to see -- and we love it! We actually painted it to match the dresser and it looks great.,1
I have not found much to complain about with this high chair. It is made well and I like the leaf design. As an added bonus it is gender neutral. It converts to a booster seat so I'm sure it will give us years of good use.,1
"This diaper bag is worth the extra money! The built in changing station is completely amazing, I've used it countless times. And when we unexpectedly had a second child, this diaper bag a place for TWO different diaper sizes. GENIUS.",1
"I love that it's made in the USA! Not designed in the USA and manufactud in China.My baby loves chewing on this, it seems to really soothe his gums. Also it's easy for him to grip (he's 4 months old) the only complaint is that it doesn't stay cold. I had one In The freezer over night. When I handed it to him it stayed cold for about 5 minutes.",1
My sister gave my son this rosary as a Baptism gift and it is beautiful! Perfect for a baby boy. I highly recommend it.,1
"I received this monitor for my baby shower. This baby monitor is functional but I have a few issues with this product. For Some reason the receiver, the one for parents to listen onto, wouldn't work when the Ac adapter is plugged into to it. The red light seems to turn on every time. But it works just fine with battery. I move the baby monitor back and forth from my room to the baby's room and it seem as though I get the same results. Loud static noise, and some places in my house just makes it even worse. It make it hard to watch tv when it's on. After reading some reviews on not having anything else plugged in the same wall adapter it seems as though the static has been reduced, but not eliminated. I can hear my baby when he is making noises but not clear enough to hear him breath, like other reviews say they can. I've been using this monitor for four months now and from day one I had to use batteries and had not had to replace them yet.",0
"For the first 3 weeks of our daughters life (before we knew about the Halo SleepSack Swaddle) she would sleep about 1/2 hour at a time.  As soon as we started using the Halo SleepSack swaddle she immediately jumped up to 3 hours of sleep at a time.  The only reason it wasn't longer was that I had to wake her up every 3 hours to eat.  At her 2 month appointment I brought in the sleep sack to the pediatrician's office because it seemed like it was too short for her, but she wasn't big enough in the chest to move to a size small.  The doctor told me that it was actually good for babies to sleep with their knees bent so I could continue using the newborn size sleep sack until she was big enough in the shoulders to transition to the small size.  I also found that the Halo SleepSack was much easier to get her in an out of than the SummerInfant brand sleep sacks.",1
the shipment was received in great condition. The quality of the product was excellent. My great- grandsons really like it.,1
"This toy box is sturdy, neutral and just the right height for my 15 month old son. We don't let him sit on the top of it, so I can't comment on how well it holds up. So far, we are pleased with this purchase.",1
I have been doing so much research about plastic bottles and finally broke down and bought these. They are great and so easy to clean if you have a dishwasher! I am so glad that I made the decision to switch they are great and so much healthier for baby! I wish that I would have done this with my first child!,1
All my baby's feedings are though these nipples and Medela bottles. My son is so comfortable with them that he will not change to anything else. They are easy flow nipples and NOT recommended for those who are nursing and also bottle feeding. Babies could find this very easy and stop nursing. I sterlize them with hot water on the stove for around 10 mins after each feed. Pretty easy to clean and lasts a long time.,1
My 15 mo old son wore this last weekend for Halloween and we literally received about 50 comments on it. Strangers were stopping to take pictures of him.  So many people told me it was the cutest costume they have ever seen.  My son has really wild hair and everyone told us he had to be Elvis for Halloween.  After searching the web for hours this was the cutest costume I found.  It came with a cute scarf and little cape also. I didn't think there was quite enough Elvis flare to this so I did glue a bunch of rhinestone on it with fabric glue and also on the belt.  The only thing bad is that I thought it fit really big but my 15 mo old son only weighs 21 pounds and is 31.5 in tall.  Since it was so long I had to use a bunch of safety pins so he wouldn't walk on it.  Also have to wash by hand but all the dirt came out really easy when I did wash by hand.  If you are looking for a cute and unique costume for your baby this is it!,1
"Love the crib. Very durable, study, and beautiful to look at. We have no problem putting our child in it confidently.",1
Not what I thought I bought this for over night use and twice my little one wet through it...with the bamboo insert and a mf....but during the day it's fine.,1
We are really pleased wit this stroller. It is at the same time strong to carry two big children (in our case of 4 yr and 1 yr) and easy to fold and unfold. I recommend it widely.,1
"As a breastfeeding mom, I couldn't live without my boppy. This boppy is very soft and quite comfy!  It is also nice for tummy time.",1
"We bought this one for our baby before she was born. She used it for about 3 months (she is 13 months now). It is sturdy but tiny, so no chance to use it for too long, unless maybe if you use a bumper which isn't recommended the first 6 months at least.  It has the size of a cradle. Actually we were able to buy a replacement mattress looking for a cradle mattress, same with the sheets.  It is a shame that it is so narrow... with a few more inches wide would be perfect por smaller spaces.",0
Just what I wanted for my office since I am a huge Disney fan!It came packaged neatly and it was a breeze to apply on the wall.Highly recommended!,1
"I love these and feel safe giving them to my baby. They are a little larger than expected so they're not the greatest teethers for little babies, but my 4 month old loves to hold them and feel the different textures and he can manage to chew on them with his front gums.",1
"After reading several reviews of this toy, I purchased it for my 5 month old son.  He spends a couple hours, everyday scooting around in his walker.  The Magic Cube is a fixture on the tray of his scooter.  While investigating all the rooms he will touch instruments on the Cube and make it play.  As always, when the Cube falls off of his walker he stops in his tracks and cries until either my wife or I pick it back up and put it on his tray again; then he's off to the next wonder of the house.  It will be interesting to see how he evolves with the interaction of this toy.  I'm glad I made this purchase.",1
"My 2.5 year old daughter received this from the ""binky fairy"" as a subsitute for one of her two binkies that she required each night. It is SO SOFT and she absolutely adores her ""Monkey""...I had to order a second one to make sure she always had a clean one available. It really helped to wean her off the binky -- once she was used to using her monkey & just one binky, then we were able to wean her off the other pacifier too.",1
"Now they don't even last a washing -- which is sad because my son asks for his ""doggie poon"" at ever meal. Then he points to the spoon and says ""owie"" because the doggie's face is nearly completely scratched off. I have all of the characters, and only the owl seems to hold up. We bought the bee set a while ago, and that one has seemed to hold up ok. I think Skiphop must have a new manufacturer.",0
"I tried it on my umbrella stroller and the cover looked hideous. It looked like I was pushing a big, grey, box. The fit was very poor and there wasn't much ventilation.Unable to refund this junk since I removed the blue film on the plastic panels.Waste of 50$",0
The best investment so far of my twin pregnancy! I can sleep so comfortably with this pillow! I get a great nights sleep EVERY NIGHT.,1
Our daughter was completely against the transition to sippy cups until we found this one. The pink is especially cute for girls. :) We've been using them for about 3 weeks now and I love everything about this cup.,1
It's a simple book and my niece loved it because it makes crinkling noise as she interacts with it.It was well worth the buy!,1
"My daughter suffered from colic and the pacifier would sometimes calm her down but it was hard to keep in her mouth. This helped to hold it in place and she liked to try and grab it, if she'd kept using her pacifier she would have been able to use this to pick it up a lot faster than if it had just been the paci, but she seemed to outgrow her paci at about 3 months.",1
"We purchased this jumperoo after reading reviews of many models online. This by far has been the best baby gear purchase we've made! My four month old son LOVES to jump and play on this. It took him a few days to get the swing of it, but once he did, he's been a bouncing machine ever since! We started out having to put a box underneath so his feet would reach a flat surface. He is highly entertained by all the toys, loves putting the butterfly in his mouth to chew on, and can easily move himself around from station to station in the seat. I can see him increasing his hand-eye coordination as he reaches deliberately for the different toys. I HIGHLY recommend this jumperoo!",1
I'm pretty sure this mug will get me promoted.  And its goldilock sized and the black interior hides the fact that it doesn't get washed.,1
"My son loves this lunch box, it has the perfect size for him to carry it. (he is 2 1/2 years old). I like the colors and it has a really good quality.",1
My wife uses these under the bra as she is still nursing a 4 month old.  The pad is thin enough that it is not really noticeable through to an outside shirt.  She likes them so I give them 5 stars too.,1
"Add a set of battery operated twinkle led Christmas lights and you have a light up necklace for the bars that on one else will have.  It just take a drill bit and 10 minutes to complete.  Now off you go, go have fun!",1
Fits standard changing pad well. Not very thick but made of soft comfortable fabric. Used almost 9 months with no complaints.,1
"I like these pouches because you can open them from the bottom and therefore you can fill in the puree manually without the infantino squeeze station. You just scoop you puree from the blender and into the pouches. Done.I wish they make a bigger version of these pouches though, 6 oz is too little I think. But anyway it's a brilliant idea these pouches!If you are on the budget, skip the infantino squeeze station and just order some of these pouches, trust me you don't need the squeezer it's just gimmicky.",1
"Easy to put on, doesn't fall out of place, color is beautiful (blue/aqua), saves city select seat from crumbs and spills, makes the stroller more comfy for my 18 month old (he's already slept on it). Will buy another one (probably in Platinum/Silver) for my other son when he is old enough to sit in the ""big boy"" seat! ;)",1
I ordered this tub for my 15lb 4  1/2 month old.  I was disappointed that he barely fits in it and he is only 4 months?!  I am not sure how a toddler could fit in this tub at all.  If it were bought at a store I would surely bring it back.,0
"I purchased the p3 in Java after researching many different strollers. In this price point there is nothing better. It rides very nicely, has sturdy construction and nice material. I like the way my son sits up in the stroller, it seems very comfortable for him. It has a nice tray for his snack. It is fairly light yet does not tip back when you put bags on the handles. I love the canopy, when sitting upright the canopy goes as far as the tray, no sun in this baby's eyes. Easy recline feature and good basket under stroller. On the down side opening and closing is a bit awkward at first and the PARENT CUP HOLDER STINKS!!(have lost a few drinks) Overall it much better than my Graco Metrolite and I wish I would have spent the money on the Peg stroller and car seat to begin with. You get what you pay for.",1
"Compact, great straps, adjustablesecure, rubber protectors on bottom,fits on chair perfectly,and folds down. What more can you as for.",1
"My 22 month old grandson loves this bed.  He has gotten too big for the play yard to sleep in.  It is easy to inflate and easy deflate.  It is very comfortable and cozy.  When he sees the bed, he runs to it and jumps on it on says, ""my bed"".  Great purchase at a great price!!",1
"I hate giving bad reviews and I really wanted this chair to work for us but I because I think this chair is unsafe I am sharing my review.Like other reviewers wanted a chair with a minimal foot print also we were concerned about the plastic trays on most high chairs containing BPA, phthalates, and lead. This seemed like a reasonable solution. We got it when my son was 4 months old, he was an early sitter and even though he was not a very sturdy sitter we loved that he could still sit up at the table with us while we had meals. The sides of the chair kept him balanced and we placed a folded up blanket in the bottom to bring him up up to the right height. When he started actually eating (at 7 months) my love affair with the chair quickly ended.* the triggers that hold the chair to the table stopped working. They just wont stay up and tight any more. They now randomly fall down leaving the chair just barely hanging on the table.  By 8 months old my son could put his feet on the table skirt and push back. This is a real safety concern because essentially he can just push himself right off the table. Several times I have put the chair on the table as tight as I can (tightening the pegs all the way up as much as possible) but when I go to lift my son from the chair one side or both comes unhooked from the table. This is just not safe and we stopped using it for this reason.* The chair only has a 4 point restraint not a 5 point. The tightness of the straps adjust over the shoulders but my son could get his feet up under himself and then start to stand up. The straps would then loosen as he put pressure on them and nothing restrained him from standing up in the seat of the chair.* The brads that attached the the strap that runs between the 2 metal legs quickly gave out from my son leaning forward against it leaving it very lose and making the space for the legs even wider. Several times my son got both legs though one hole with out us knowing it and then started slouching down in the seat. Since there is no 5th point in the restraint he could simply slip out the leg hole and fall to the floor. Luckily we were all at the table both times this happen and we quickly pulled him out.*for practical reasons this chair does not make a good everyday chair. There will always be a gap between the chair and the table and even with toddlers it is inevitable that food will accidentally be dropped down this gap. Because it is fabric it washes well but you can't simply wipe it down. It is totaly impractical to pull the cover off after every meal and wash it.I wish I could say that I just got a bum chair but my mother bought this same chair for my son to use at her house and when ours stopped staying clipped to the table she gave us hers and we used it until all of the same issues surfaced.I am recommending that you not buy this chair because I really feel that it is not safe. We recently got a minui handysitt and are much happier with it so I would suggest that as an option for parents who want a travel seat or a low profile chair for every day use.Good luck to you.",0
"One of the two doesn't cling to any window, and neither of them block much sun at all.We bought these to use in our sunroom, above the computer desk when working in the morning. They don't really help much at all.",0
"We've been using this for two weeks with our 11 month old and so far, this has been a fantastic chair!  This was my spurge purchase, because generally more expensive than most high chairs, but we are totally happy with it! Like a few other reviewers, we have wood floors and it's working out well. Seems like it might be even better when she is a litte bigger - she has some trouble sitting up, but that could be her and not the chair.  Either way, love the cushion, the tray, the wheels and all the different chair settings.  Also, really happy I purchased this on Amazon.  At a local baby store, this chair was selling for $50+ more.",1
"Use them to protect the seat back from my son who sits in a booster seat.  Not sure what people in other reviews talk about with having the strap going across the seat back. Just push down into the bottom of the seat cushion.  Problem solved.  Expensive for just one, but all I needed.  Seems very durable.  Time will tell.",1
"This item is exactly what I expected and it goes well with the stroller and car seat. My son is not born as yet, but I am sure he will enjoy it.",1
Very light material-perfect for Arizona summer sleeping. My baby kept &#34;hulking&#34; out of it and would get mad.. so we eventually stopped using it.,1
"Baby Gate- was to keep our new puppy from going where it shouldn't. Worked very well, holds tight on door frames.",1
"I love the convenience of not having to worry about special bags, that's why I rated this so high. However, when I first started using this diaper pail, the velcro from my daughter's diapers was getting stuck on something inside the lid.  Needless to say, getting the diapers unstuck was disgusting.  Once I yanked out the fabric that the diapers were getting stuck on, I really liked the diaper pail.  The dirty diapers still stink, so I put each dirty diaper in its own sack and throw them out in the kitchen garbage so that they go out every night.  Now my house never stinks like a dirty diaper.",1
"I loved these sippy cups because they nested, unlike most sippy cups.  However, most of the lids have cracked.  I bought six cups in May 2012 and 6 in December 2012.  More than half of the lids have cracked.  I always hand wash them.  I'd like more but not sure if they'll crack again.",0
"But I'm assuming anything waterproof with a plastic lining or layer between fabrics will do that. We use it between the mattress and sheets, but she still sweats on it.",0
"I bought a fancier brand that was almost double the price, It only lasted for few months. I had to throw it away and buy this one. The padded one I throw away didn't stand the washing and bleaching regularly. It started to crack and the sponge absorbed the water. This is perfect. Clean as much as you like. Clean as new every time.",1
"These are nice training pants. I like that they are waterproof, but sometimes we have leaks. They are a little pricey, but a nice tool in potty training.",1
"La verdad es que son excelente, de muy buen material,buen dise&ntilde;o, comodas y facil de usar, pero algo caras en comparacion por ejempl con las lansinoh que son muy buenas y la relacion precio valor es menor",1
The bottles do the job they are supposed to do. Milk doesn't leak from the space between the nipple and the ring and the flow seems right. But the most important thing is they are BPA free. I read about it in parents magazine and I'm happy that I picked this inexpensive bottles over pricier and better looking ones. BPA used in plastic bottles is considered a potantial hazard to children's health. Though more research is needed for a definite verdict. Anyhow you won't go wrong avoiding it I guess.,1
"My Grand daughter loves this! She enjoys the tiny night light and she and her sister enjoy the constellation display so much! I would recommend this to any parent with a little one! Actually, I would say even a teen would like this cuddly little bug!",1
"I love this crib! It is modern and adorable! I am 5'1, so it's easy for me to lean over it...the only problem I have had are: finding bumpers that fit! For some reason bumpers don't fit it correctly, so you will have to cut the strings off and resew them to where the bars are - also, the skirts don't fit right either, I made my own of both, I got so tired of trying different bumpers/skirts...Also, I don't know if it's from the wider top, but I couldn't get a crib mobile to fit, so I found a mobile that mounted to the wall, even better! I didn't have to scuff up the crib! The drawer is awesome! Not flimsy at all! But I only store blankets and swaddlers in it...also, it does stick out a tiny bit from the crib, so your skirt will have to be tucked behind it, not in front of it...I have uploaded some pics of what I did! Also, the crib is a VERY bright white, it matches perfectly to the Koppang dresser at IKEA (we are using as a changing table) It VERY much clashes with the popular hemnes line and that really bothered me! So, please know that most baby bedding/furniture is a cream color, so it is a bit hard to match, if you are as OCD about your ""white shades"" as I am ;)Also, as far as the mattress, it fit perfect, I ordered it from Walmart and it was 52"", the Safety 1st - Sweet Dreams Crib and Toddler Mattress- and it fit perfect! So, I'm pretty sure standard crib/toddler mattresses will all fit great!",1
"My daughter is 18 months old and she has slept on this mattress since she was 2 months old. It is a little soft but I think that it is still safe. It's not like she ever sunk into it. She loves her bed and she actually tries to get into it when she is tired. If anything happened to it, I would definitely have to replace it.",1
"They are perfect for my son, who refuse to drink out of Nuk silicone sprout (it worked well for his older sister). I hated all the sippy cups that are not microwave safe, I had to heat milk up in other containers and pour it in. What a pain! My husband is also clueless and microwave them from time to time, it stress me out. Bottom line, these are awesome for being microwave safe and super easy to drink out of.",1
"This is a must-have for bathing baby.  We bought it together with the primo eurobath tub after seeing a recommendation for it and couldn't be happier!  Like some of the other reviewers, we initially used the safer bather on the counter top to sponge bathe our newborn, then moved it to the baby tub.  Baby was so comfortable and I had no worries about slipping.  From time to time I tried it without the safer bather, and wanted a third hand to hold him!Now, our big boy is ready for the grown up tub and uses the safer bather there.  He seems so secure, and I think the familiarity might even help make the big tub less daunting.Well worth the price.",1
Its a perfect fit mattress for crib and my son is enjoying it. Delivery was prompt and quality seems to be nice. Local Babyrus had this item for 199. got it for good price at Amazon.,1
"My husband and I are VERY disappointed and shocked by how awful this bassinet is. We ordered it because we liked the color and it looked nice and simple and it was inexpensive. Well, we got what we paid for!!1. It comes in 3 parts so you would think assembly would be a piece of cake. EVERYTHING about assembling this is awful. There are metal wires on the back that you have to force into these clips which is almost impossible because the wire is way too long. I, 10 months pregnant, had to push the opposite side of the bassinet as hard as i could so my husband could try to get the wire into the clips that it comes with. This took us a very long time.2. Next we tried to pull the legs apart which were wedged together by all the screws and things attached.3. THE CANOPY! You would think this would be a sinch, right? The canopy wires (or wine as they call them in the instructions!!) was backwards. The canonpy is so flimsy that it hardly is worthwhile. Once we got the canopy wire turned around correctly, we pushed as hard as possible to insert the canopy into the base and twice in about an hour the canopy already popped out which clearly poses a safety issue if there were a baby inside!4. The wheels were very hard to insert to the point that they clicked in.5. The instructions were obviously written by a non-English speaking person. Not only is the grammar horrific, there are spelling errors and the instructions tell you NOTHING. What does, ""Pull forward to open, pull afterward to close"" mean? This is all that is given on how to insert the canopy. Which again, you would think would be self explanatory. But when you are trying for 20 minutes to get it to insert and the wire is backwards, you look for some sort of instruction. The only instruction they do give is the obvious. Again, open canopy? Ok, thank you. that's great. HOW DO YOU INSERT IT PROPERLY???6. Finally, the color is very weird. I wouldnt have even mentioned this if it wasnt so awful in every other way. I thought it was going to be green, but like a previous review said, its blue and yellow plaid with green ruffles. The sheet that comes with it is a very rough material. The basket beneath seems impossible to get into as there is just a very small opening on the sides. All of this I could have lived with.I am so frustrated with this because we are having our baby in 3 days and the bassinet just arrived. I was excited, assuming we would have the bassinet in time for the baby. Now it appears we are going to have to return it because it is so awful.(If we can figure out how to get this thing apart!!! and no wonder it is out of stock everywhere!!!!! no one wants to sell junk like this!) I was going to keep it and make do with it until the canopy continued to pop out. I can't put my baby in something this unsafe. And now its to the point where I am so frustrated with how poorly made this is that even though it was only $60, it's the principle that I want something that will last through future children. I have no idea where we are going to put our baby for the first week or so during the most exhausting period of motherhood!! Thanks a lot Dream on Me!!!!!!!!!",0
My great grandson was born early and was 3 lbs 6 oz.  I knew they would need something to keep him safe in his car seat.  The reviews for this were very good so I bought it.  When he came home he was 4 lbs 4 oz.  My granddaughter loves it. He looks so cute in it.  I think he'll be using it for sometime.,1
I got my son the frog and it is cute but the stitching started coming apart in three places after the first wash. I would have expected more from a relatively expensive towel. Not worth the time or expense to return but I am very disappointed in my purchase. I will not be purchasing others.,0
"A formula dispenser is a very convenient item to have on the go and at night to store premeasured powder formula that you can just pour into a bottle. However, I do not recommend this particular dispenser.I never got a chance to use it because I sterilized it before using. It came out of a steam sterilizer all warped and smelling like plastic. Then I looked closely and it said ""made in China"" and ""do not sterilize.""I had nothing else to do but to throw it out. Also the smell made me feel uncomfortable. I really didn't like the plastic it was made with. It does say BPA free though.The next day I bought a formula dispenser by NUK. I like that it is made in USA, from a much better quality materials and it was written on the box, ""sterilize before first use."" People who do not understand why anyone would sterilize a formula dispenser probably do not use it for an infant. If you sterilize the bottles you may want to sterilize the dispenser as well.",0
"I could easily give this product 5 stars if it just stayed on. I tried slightly wetting the suction cups and that helped a little bit, but baby still was able to rip it off. Nonetheless, she still got tons of entertainment out of it.The chair itself definitely gets 5 stars from me. We used it as an infant seat, a high chair, and a bath seat for when she outgrew her infant tub.  It's attractive and compact.",0
"I bought the Snuza about a month ago.  When I got it, it seemed as though the battery life was depleted, but I went with it anyhow, about 2 weeks ago the alarm started going off for no apparent reason, when the baby was awake.  I took the cover off the back of the Snuza and discovered that the battery was not snapped in the slot all the way, so that would explain the alarm going off so randomly.I have since bought a replacement battery and haven't had any issues since.  I like that it has a ticking sound option, I use the ticking at night and during naps just use the snuza with out the ticking.I would have given this product 5 stars had the battery not been depleted when I received it.  Plus if the diaper isnt' hooked tight enough or there are gaps the alarm will also sound.  Or if the diaper gets too full overnight, the snuza will come away from the belly and alarm goes off.  Have had this happen twice.Overall a great product and would recommend it to anyone.",1
"It can only handle small portions at a time, not for making huge amounts of baby food to store, but wonderful for making up a small batch for a couple of days.  Purees the baby food very quickly.  Of course, I have only used soft and cooked foods in it so far.  It is a bit noisy, but what food processor isn't.  The assembly is quick, once you get the lid on the container and plug in the unit, just touch and go.",1
they do not leak and are very durable! they have been thrown and dropped numerous times and they are still good as new!,1
"This bottle has a softer nipple than most which really does make it more &#34;natural&#34; for babies that are also breast-feeding. Because it is softer, I recommend when cleaning it, use warm soapy water and use your pinky to wash interior surface if you don't have long nails. This will help protect the nipple to last longer as sometimes sponges and brushes are too tough for the delicate nipple.The shape of the bottle is also nice because of the contour - it makes the bottle easier for older babies and toddlers to hold on their own.",1
"I got sick of constantly throwing bags out after my kids brought home their lunch.. these are great, cute monster designs which the kids think are fun, the zips work great too and the bags are nice and roomy.. kind of wish they were see through but they are a-ok as is.. Will definitely reorder.",1
"I purchased these ""potty covers"" for my grandaughter to use when she needs to use a public restroon.  The design of these are adorable and with the sticking labels on the underside it stays in place so I don't need to hold her up while she's using the potty.  Also, I can put a couple in my purse and have them for when we go out unexpectly.  I gave it four stars because they cannot be flushed down the toilet.",1
"I ordered this for my granddaughter, who is now two months old. She likes to be swaddled, but also likes to kick her little legs and move her arms. Also, since we live in Texas, she needs something lightweight. This wrapsack blanket perfectly fulfills our needs. It is very lightweight, so she doesn't get too hot, and it makes swaddling her very easy, instead of the usual protracted process of rolling a screaming, squirming child up n her blanket. The legs are loose enough that she can kick and there is room for her little arms to come out and wave. I would definitely recommend this for parents of new babies!",1
I love this plate.  It is perfect for feeding my little one.  It is very easy to use and easy to clean up.  It keeps my daughters food warm throughout her eating time. It also does away with the microwave which breaks down some of the essentioal nutrients in the baby food.  It also warms baby food from the refrigerator.  Great product.,1
I bought the set for my 3yr old nephew and it's fantastic.  The plastic is sturdy and I love that it's made in the USA.  Will pick up the other color for my niece.  Makes a great gift item as well.,1
I have a city mini GT stroller. This shade didn't seem to work with it so I had to return it.,0
"When I was looking for a step stool for my kids I was astonished at how ugly so many of them are. The Babybjorn is a nice and simple design an adult can live with, and a cute, but not cutesy-ootsey, graphic--just enough to look ""kid-friendly"". And the step stool works excellently.I've noticed a number of reviews talk about 2 or 3-year olds using it. And I'm guessing from what they said their kids are using it as a potty step. I guess some 2 or 3-yo could successfully use it, but I wouldn't recommend it in general. Mostly, I see it as a sink step, for kids who are using or beginning to use the sink to wash their hands or brush their teeth, usually around 4, maybe a bit earlier. Personally, I think most 2-yo kids are not ready for this type of stool, especially around toilets, which are pretty unforgiving if you slip up near them.A nice thing about this step stool is its light weight. My 6-yo happily carries and uses it wherever she needs it. And yet it is sturdy. Even my wife and I (~200 lb) use it sometimes (but not together;). It's survived 2 years of use, and still looks fine.",1
I looked at a lot of bed sets and I am very pleased that I purchased this set. It is really cute and good quality!,1
"I chose this set because I just HAD to have the &#34;flying doggy&#34; print.Three of the four blankets are excellent. One went straight to Goodwill.The striped blanket is stiff and awful. Even after numerous washes in fabric softener it is not a fabric I would use with a baby.It could maybe, maybe, be a picnic blanket, but not a baby blanket and no way would I swaddle with it.That said, I'm happy enough with the other three to keep the set and take the loss of one of the four.",0
I liked the Happi Tummi concept... the warmth and the pressure really helped my son's colic (and helped to keep him warm during the cold winter months)  The only disadvantage for me was that it was too big for my kiddo...they need to make smaller ones for small babies and preemies.,1
"These cups are the best - they have thought of everything. They are attractive, have grippy material on the outside making it easy for little hands to hold on to, are in a real cup shape so they are getting used to holding a cup (and not handles), have a cover to keep the mouthpiece clean when not in use, and the mouthpiece is nice and soft. The only problem? These are not $18 cups!! Amazon usually has the best prices on everything which is why sometimes I do not price compare. I should have. I bought these from Amazon a few months ago and then just this week. I went to Babies R Us and found that their regular price is $7.99!! So I have been paying $10 more each time I bought them. NOT cool! So get them at Babies R US b/c they are awesome.",1
We we're looking for a cup holder that would work well with our stroller that didn't have the standard round bars most strollers have. The Velcro strap mount works really well on a variety of locations and contains two rubber attachments that work for different types of strollers.It works well for most stabdard sized bottles  some of the larger style water bottles won't fit.,1
This unit fit in mt Jetta and holds my Grandson securely and safely. Satisfied with product and seller. Highly recommend both.,1
"It barely held 5 toys without falling apart. Sometimes they wouldn't even stay on the hooks that came with the nets. I am sure I could find different hooks and find another purpose for them, but for toys, it rarely held up to its purpose.",0
"Wanted something wood, sturdy for the occasional sleepover by my grandson.  Goes with the decor.  Heavy.  Use with the crib mattress that I already had.  Happy.",1
I like it . I love the simplicity of it but my son is not comfortable on it at all .,1
I bought this for a day care and it really helps to prevent the kids from sticking their fingers in the door.,1
"My 2 year old LOVES this matching puzzle.  She has to play it at least 3 times per day!  It is great for teaching them colors, textures, and similarities!  Highly recommended",1
"I gave one of these to my daughter when she had her first child.  She loved it.  When another baby came along in 17 months, I purchaseda second one for her.  It is nice that she can use one handset and switch between cameras to keep an eye on both babies.  When shehad a problem with the last one, the manufacturer sent a replacement within a couple of days.  Makes a wonderful gift.",1
"At times I have gotten a different temperature depending on which side of  the head I use. If I get a high reading, I always check it again on the opposite side. In general it is pretty accurate.",0
"My son loves animals, and he loves this skip hop zoo backpack. The quality is good and the design is cute. They have many other cute designs too.",1
"Cute - yes, but I really bought this for me, it helps me keep track of the binky (pacifier).The colors are bright and our 3 month old is able to grab it and pull the bink to his mouthall on his own.  I like that it is super lightweight and there are no beads for a possible chokinghazard if a seam opened up.  The wubbanub won't get lost in a seat crevice or hit the floorand roll under a sofa and it is easily seen even at night.  We spot clean the dragon as neededand wash the soothie on a regular basis and have had no issues with pilling or fading.  Noregrets on this purchase.  $16.95 and free shipping.",1
"I agree with the other reviewers.  I bought this thermometer because it reads temperatures quickly and is easy to use.  However, as other reviewers mentioned it gives completely inconsistent readings.  My son had a cold and I took his temperature and it read 100.4.  I took it again a minute later and it read 97.5!!  I then took it a couple more times to try and get a consistent reading and got 98.1 and 100.7.  Thankfully I had another thermometer that I could use that gave me a consistent temperature.  I'm going to return this item.",0
"I was hesitant about these because of the ratings but figured I could send them back if they did not work for me.I bought one for my daughter and one for me since we both have showers that have a fiberglass surround with basically no ledge. I read the instructions about attaching to a dry clean surface and did so the night before. First hers fell off and woke everyone up with the huge bang that sounded like the house was being broken into. And about the time we recovered and went back to sleep, mine fell off - NOT a great evening for sleeping.None the less, the next morning while in the shower, I reattached mine and this time it held. It has been holding for a few months now and works great. I think they should change the instructions to a clean &#34;damp&#34; surface because that is what works.",1
"I bought this carseat for our first baby in 2004 because it had the 2nd highest rating after Britax which was $299.  Back then I bought this carseat for $100.  It's easy to install and easy to buckle in my son and a lot easier to take him out just by loosening the harness.  Last year I was rear ended by a van and my 2.5 yr old son was fine and safe in his Triumph carseat as well as his 8 mos. old brother.I had my parents buy the Evenflo Titan which was cheaper and came in 3rd on Consumer Reports but it's a pain getting my son in and out of the Titan. Six months ago we bought another Evenflo Triumph for our then 14 mos. old son.  We installed it rear facing in our """"03 Honda Odyssey with no problems (just slide the honda seat back and recline it a little to give the baby leg room.)  There's plenty of room for the driver's seat to slide back or recline.  I highly recommend this carseat for your baby's safety.",1
"These work in an emergency. For really gross bathroom situations they did the job. However, they aren't that great. I found them hard to position and use. Wouldn't purchase again.",0
EVERY parent should have one of these!  Our son is 5 years old and we have been using this since he was a baby.....now I buy one for every baby shower that I go to.  Its easy to use and easy to clean!,1
I had this item for my 1st son and it's the only thing I will use for my new born when his teeth come in. I was amazed at how well it worked. I have told many friends about this item and they have bought and used it for their kids. Don't waste your money on ointments.,1
Your Mamaroo isn't a mamaroo till you own this. My daughter took many naps with this insert. plus it so cute!!,1
I wanted to get a chair for my youngest grandchild and made a list of about 20 to send to my son and daughter in law which ranged from $50.00 to $200.00.  He said they liked this gingham best and it did rate well although it was one of the lower priced ones. I think it was around $65 or $70 when I bought it.  I talked to him last night since she has been using it since before Christmas and he said she loves sitting in it and can get a lot of books on the seat with her.  This makes her very happy.  He said it seems very sturdy and doesn't wobble.  Only problem he has is she likes to shove it on the hardwood floors but so far it has not scratched them.  He now has it up against the wall.  He said the fabric looks like it will hold up well too.,1
Didn't want to spend a fortune but wanted one not side by side. This had really good reviews so I purchased it. Really liked it and is easy to push. Also has great storage below!,1
Loved the panda forms and the different angles of the bears. The mobile is exactly what I wanted and is very pleasing to look at. I only hope the baby likes it as much as I do :D,1
It is well made and fits just right. You get the hardware with it. It really goes great with a jungle themed nursery for our son.,1
Just the right size to hang over our sons bed and keep all his stuffed animals close by. No problems with this transaction.,1
Best Christmas present my husband ever got me while I was pregnant ;) Love the versatility of the pillow. It does take up some space on the bed but me and baby deserves it haha.,1
"been using it for about 3 months now, and it works fantastic.  My daughter is almost 2 yrs old, and not a single molecule of odor escapes.  Bags seem a little pricey but actually last for quite a long time.",1
"I bought this sling because I was looking for a convenient, safe carrier for my eight-pound newborn. Even though this product is advertised for 8+ pounds, the sling is way too big for an eight-pound baby. When I put him in it, it totally swallowed him up, making it seem awkward and maybe even unsafe, as his head was covered. The warnings for this sling tell you to make sure the baby's face is visible, and to keep the baby upright, but that is impossible to do with a small baby. Also, I'm petite, and the sling seems too big for me, as well. I'm hoping that I can get some use out of it once my baby can be carried on the hip. If you're looking for a sling for a newborn, I would go with a ring sling instead.",0
"I needed an inexpensive umbrella stroller for a weekend trip to the Big City.  This is the perfect umbrella stroller except for the canopy.  It really shouldn't even be called a canopy as it covers and shades abolutely nothing.  But aside from that it's easy to open and close, my child was comfortable and it steers smoothly.  The front console is wonderful!  It holds drinks, sippy cups, keys, cell phones, boarding passes, everything!  And the little underneath basket is handy!",1
"Like many others, we started with the BabyBjorn Air - which worked very well for us from 4 days old until he was about 6 months old.  We had a BIG baby, and I think that helped us to fit the Bjorn right away.  Fast forward to 6 months old, and our little guy was SO heavy that mama developed a couple herniated discs in her back from all that baby wearing!  I had to have epidural steroid injections to control the pain and pretty much stopped baby wearing shortly thereafter.  The baby's delivery also broke my tailbone, so I've been hobbling around like I'm 80 for a while now.I noticed that my baby's behavior started to change as I started to carry him less, and he became more clingy and uptight over the next few months.  He's always been a cuddly guy, but it got to the point where he just seemed bored and fussy much more often.  In fact, he became downright draining and difficult - I was taking MANY more deep breaths than ever before, and I'm a REALLY patient lady!Finally, our physician suggested we had a ""high needs"" or ""difficult"" baby.  I got online and saw that many moms see improvement with some of the high needs stuff if they wear the baby.  That's when I realized his behavior had changed when I stopped wearing him.  I wasn't sure how I'd do it with my busted back, but I wanted to at least try.  I decided to go with the Bjorn Comfort because it had lumbar support and could support my big boy (many of the bjorns have limits around 26lbs, but the comfort had a limit around 30), but was unable to find the bjorn comfort at any retailer within 200+ miles of here (I live in Portland, OR), nor any of the 6 second-hand stores I tried.  I resigned myself to ordering the Bjorn comfort from amazon without trying it on first, but made one last stop at Target.  They had the Ergo in Galaxy Grey.  I gave it a try and HOLY MOLY, what a difference.  I can now wear my 25 pound baby for over an hour and nothing in my back hurts.  I could probably wear him longer, but he does get a little grouchy if I push it without giving him a break to run around - he's learning to walk and VERY excited to do that as much as possible.Given how ""spirited"" he is, I thought he'd be so frustrated facing me, but instead he just relaxed right into it and gave me many hugs while we walked around the house and neighborhood.  My legs are a little sore because they have to get used to carrying that much weight around again, but at least it is muscle pain and no longer something more severe like herniated discs!  The cloth used in the Ergo is softer and cushier than those Bjorn uses, so the whole thing feels so cozy.  As usual, my boy loves to chew on the straps (he's got very sharp, piranha-like teeth) and they seem plenty sturdy for this.  It does get hot and sweaty between us if I wear it in temps above 78 or so, but then again, so did the Bjorn air, which was supposed to be the most breathable.  I like things that look more utilitarian/simple/plain and have less hipster style, but I gotta say, this thing is pretty darn cute to wear with just about anything too because it is so neutral.  I would highly recommend this carrier!",1
"I bought this chair for our second child after seeing the great reviews that it had. It seemed wonderful at first--all the features that you want--easy recline, two chair inserts, two trays, easy to fold BUT after using it a month it started to go downhill.  The seat belt is a five point BUT BEWARE it is joined by metal ""O"" shaped clasps that rip the seatbelt and make it hard to adjust and then finally it broke entirely.  Next, the tray did fine in the tightest position but when we were ready to move it out a little it wouldn't stay put. MAJOR PROBLEM--we now have a one year old with a broken seat belt and a tray that he can push right off.  I called the company and they would NOT replace the high chair.  They wanted to keep sending me parts without knowing for sure what would fix it.  I was not going to jeopordize the safety of my child until they found the fix.  In addition, they wanted me to take pictures of the chair and send them to them???  A lot of my time when they were willing to do very LITTLE to insure the safety of my child and the satisfaction of their product.  Get rid of this highchair before you need the seatbelt because it will break (we returned two due to this problem).  The problem is that a lot of people buy highchairs before their babies are born or early on, when you don't need the seatbelt and by the time it is needed and doesn't work it is too late to return so BEWARE!!I have since bought the Polly by Chicco. . .a litte more money, but well worth it.  The seat belt is wonderful in this one and it has all the same great features and is even a slimmer fold!",0
We picked he colors for my daughters room based off of these plaques. They ate absolutely adorable. Will definitely recommend!!,1
"I no longer have to grab multiple items to change my baby's diaper.  When I'm out of the house, it is so easy to grap my Diapees and Wipees and know that I have everything that I need.  It can fit wipes, 3 diapers and a disposable changing pad.",1
"I agree that it washes bottles.  The bristles got hard after a month of use, but haven't fractured yet.  We stopped using it.  It washed the bottom of the bottle ok.  The ouside of the nipple just swell.. it's really kinda a terrible brush for the inner part of the nipple.  It reaches nothing.  The bristles are too short.  I do happen to get a lot more wet than with the other brushes I purchased, though all of them leave me kinda sprayed.  This washes pump parts TERRIBLY.  Again it just doesn't get into the hard to reach places.  So if you're all formula and don't hate that the end ""nipple cleaner"" of the brush is really just a hard nub without any scrub to it, it's ok.  Don't buy if you have pump parts.",0
"We used this stroller for Disneyland. It was great! It is easy to push and has a big storage area underneath. We also loved switching the seats around so our kids could face different directions. We liked this much better than a sit n stand, because both kids got to take naps if needed. The only cons would be that every time you fold up the stroller, you have to detach the seats first. They are easy to detach, just a hassle when you are getting in and out of the tram at Disneyland. On the other hand, this is one of the smoothest rides for a double stroller, easy steering. Glad we bought!",1
"Great valance!  Goes great with Nautica Emma's Bedding!  Looks great in my daughter's """"big girl room""""!",1
"I was concerned about the size due to other ratings, but it worked great for my niece, which is a petite little girl.  I think that she will be able to use it for at least a year or more.  My brother's family travels frequently and it has worked great for them.  It folds quickly and easily and takes up little space.  They plan to fit it into a suitcase for their travel out of the country.  This is a great little starter bike at a great price.",1
"This cuddly, well made Croc innocently wears mismatched socks and holds the mates and more in his ... claws. He also has a gentle rattle inside. Of course the socks are really for baby. The whole thing is adorable, safe, excellently crafted. I love it... and so did everyone at the shower.",1
"This item is really cute, my daughter loves it. However its small enough to fit inside the &#34;big&#34; mail box (when they leave you a key) so its not big at all, for the amount I think it should have been much bigger",0
"Excellent product! It came perfectly organized in the box. It looks like the one in the picture, it's white so it can be for either boys or girls.",1
The smell is really strong and the painted parts of the toys are sticky. It feels like they have been made too long ago and are starting to disintegrate. I will not give this to my baby.,0
"i love this product lets face it blankets,bumper pads,pillows and all deco in babys crib is NOT safe ilove the fact i can dress my baby in something that she loves and is SAFE and cozy she loves this when i put it on her she knows it is bed time and she starts rubbing her eyes and preparing to sleep please dont use blankets in babys crib its just NOT safe buy these they are GREAT!!!",1
Our little one has loved white noise since the day he was born. We were having to use simplynoise.com to get him to sleep or calm down and leaving our laptop in his crib has never been ideal. Also our LO does not like car rides very much. This has been a life saver! It might not have continuous play but our baby doesn't need it. He's calmed or falls asleep by the time it's finished. I love the velcro and that we can have it hang in his car seat or put in his crib where it isn't a danger. This and our swing are must haves for our little family!,1
A perfect addition to the nursery for my granddaughter who is due soon. Looks great with the other items purchased.,1
"I picked these up in another store, and so I didn't benefit from these reviews. The packaging implies that the plugs require two steps to be removed, which seemed to be even more secure than the ones that fit snuggly into sockets and sit nearly flush against the faceplate. In fact, the handle in the front makes it easier for them to be removed. Baffling. Skip this item!",0
Nice chairLoved the colorBig size to last my son most of his school yearsVery happy with the quality,1
"I bought it before my kid was born... Now we opened it to use, and it turned out all the cups have been used!!! They do not look fresh, and seems that they have been washed by hand (and not very well). Only one set of cups and spoons were clean as new. I have thrown away all the others. I would give 0 stars if it was possible. Don't waste 10$, it's a gamble.",0
This is very cute but a lot smaller than it looks. I am glad I bought it on sale. Its overpriced (not on sale) in my opinion. I got several of them for about $11 each. Would not be a good shower gift where you pass around the gifts - looks pretty small and cheap. I am reserving them for gifts for acquaintances from work etc. I am satisfied for the price that I paid but dont be fooled by the picture - check out the dimensions.,0
"I bought this thing for my new nephew and I'm satisfied, his parents told me That was the best gift they received, I recommend it, excellent product.",1
This helped our daughter so much. Lots of different feel to it to help get those little teeth started. Would suggest getting!,1
Product was delivered promptly. Assembly easy and installation went smoothly.This booster seat is also adjustable to position seat belt as child grows.,1
"Such a help to entertain and create a comfy position with entertainment and gentle vibration.Goes wherever the action is, from floor to counter top.",1
"I bought this carseat to use in my car for my granddaughter.  Her mom and dad bought the same one and told me about it.  After searching intently for one, I bought this one after my daughters' suggestion.  My granddaughter loves this carseat, it's easy to put in and is very well padded. I would highly recommend this carseat to any one!!",1
"We bought this stroller last year before our trip to Disneyland and we use it quite a bit!  Very sturdy, good size wheels, nice small under stroller compartment and we really like the cup holder/zipper container at the top by the handles.  Holds good amount of things. Highly recommend this stroller!",1
"I was going to buy that ""other"" brand crib soother that looks like an aquarium that has gotten good reviews... but I didn't want to spend that much money.This one was a lot simpler than I expected. Nothing moves in it (For some reason, I was expecting the animals to move), it's basically a very simple diorama with flashing lights, but it serves it's purpose. I was able to place my crying baby in the crib, turn this thing on, and she would immediately quiet down and turn to stare at it. It only runs for 5 minutes before turning off, so sometimes my daughter would start crying when it shut off if she was still awake.My daughter eventually figured out how to turn it back on by pressing on the fabric ladybug, so now she can play it to her heart's content.",1
I got this for my 15 month old daughter for easter and she loved to play with it in the bath tub.,0
"These wall decals have pretty much """"made"""" our nursery. I love how it gives the room a nursery appropriate theme without being permanent. I can easily remove the decals and place them in different locations. The only downside is you really do need atleast 2 if not 3 sets of the decals to properly decorate a typical size child's room. But overall very pleased with this purchase!",1
I just hate when they send at random a color. I was hoping for something girly and got a blue monkey and blue heart. The heart can work but not the monkey. I am unable to return being home bound disabled sure wish they would change there ordering ways even yellow would of been better. Other than that the product is fine.,1
"I was so excited when I found this Bc I was looking for a good and dependable pink camo diaper bag. It was shipped and arrive ahead of schedule which was great! It seems very well but together and isn't cheap. Definitely worth the money! I am a little cautious about the inside pockets, it seems they are a little fragile Bc they are made out of the same material as the lining. I will only put light items in the inner pockets. The other pockets are sturdy and fantastic! I love it so far and will be ordering one for my friend!",1
"I bought 3 of these wet bags.  I have used them for three months and washed them as advised by Planet Wise and have 2 of the 3 with broken zippers.  I have contacted customer service, where they made me take pictures and print reciepts for them, which I happily did.  Then they told me that they would only send me a replacement after I sent back my wetbags to them, however I emailed and explained that I needed to have at least one more wetbag if I sent two in for daycare, so I could do laundry every other day.  They never replied.  I called them, never got an answer. Finally returned to amazon and asked for a refund.  Will never buy their product again.",0
I though it would have been made better but it's good for the price! But I did find myself buying another diaper bad this one doesn't zip afraid of things falling out,0
THIS PRODUCT IS  MAKING GREAT JOB ON HARD CODITION.BUY U WILL NOT BE SORRY,1
"I bought this dresser thinking it was a similar style to a $1000 one that Pottery Barn Kids carries. While the look may be similar, it stops there. Firstly, this dresser does not resemble white in any way. If antique white means ivory or cream, why don't they just call it by either? The size is also diminutive. The drawers are very shallow and will not accommodate a growing child or their accumulation of wardrobe. While the outside packaging seemed secure enough, the inside revealed many damaged parts. The assembly directions have to be the worst part of this dresser. The instructions very often skipped steps or assumed you had already performed the tasks necessary to connect so and so piece together. Also, the directions fail to adequately identify which piece is which- making the assembly a tedious and frustrating endeavor and I have put together many pieces. The pros of this dresser are that it is definitely better quality than your average IKEA piece. While it is still constructed of particle wood, the parts are adequately thick making it solid enough...though certainly not comparable to Pottery Barn's furniture. Aesthetically, it is a pretty good looking dresser.",0
"I purchased this for my grandson to use when he visits.  It's okay when using it for a small child, but as he has  grown, we find that it is a little snug and he is small for his age at 2 1/2.  The concept is great and stores compactly.  I think it would be great when travelling or when going out to eat.  It's certainly more sanitary to place your child in this seat and use the attachable tray, rather than placing him in a restaurant supplied highchair or booster seat and using the common table. Even with the chair being a little on the small side, I would definitely advise purchasing this chair for the occasional use.",1
"I got this set for a friend, but only after my daughter got one and used it through her worst teething years. The entire thing is soft and chewable.  She used the ring part for her back teeth and I used to refridgerate it for something cool on her gums.  Its also textured all over to help massage their sore gums.  Love it!",1
"My son loves this jumperoo. We got it when he just turned 4 months and it is his favorite place to be, besides beging held. It gives me a change to get things done around the house. Now that he is 5 months old he is playing with everything. The only thing I would change is that if the bird and frog that are hanging could be a little lower so he could grab them. This can frusterate him at time since he can not reach it. I love this product.",1
I got this for my chihuahua. I use it when I have to leave my dog alone for a while so he doesn't run all over the house and potentially make a mess. It's very easy to use. There's no assembly required. It works best over doorways. I tried using it over just a walk way but it doesn't stay too well. The gate is also very light weight. It'll hold up quite well for my dog!,1
"I like the pad so far. Has worked well after washing and some accidents in the bed (protected the mattress good). I wish it would lay more flat on the mattress, though I'm using it with a the Clouds & Stars QuickZip sheets, so that might be the problem. These flat crib pads are the best to use with those kind of sheets (not the fitted mattress pad).",1
"I bought 2 of these rails (in white) and the instructions do say to be used with a matress & boxspring. I had to use commonsense to install it since the instructions are of no real help. We have a twin size bed with a high matress for our 2 yrs. The square bar is just below the top of the matress so that it does not touch her when she's sleeping. She's been taking her naps in her bed and no roll overs or falling out. So far so good. The only con is the instructions. It does not say how to fold it down. I got it by looking at the image. When you have the lower bar set to unlock,each of the hidged bars have arrows on it. Pull them up at the same time and voila! it folds down! Sorry if my comment is long but I want to give out as much info for those who are thinking about buying it, especially those that cannot figure out how to fold it down.",1
"My 9 month old daughter has been using this jumperoo since she was 4 months old. She loves jumping in it and has a blast doing so! She also loves playing with the toys! The music is fun, and I like how you can choose whether you want the music to play continuously or only when the baby jumps.",1
sofia the first toddler bedding.  for our 4 yr old who sleeps in a toddler size bunk bed.  she really likes this.  now all we need is some jumbo plush from sofia the first to work as pillows!,1
"This crib is acceptable. I've had for a few years now. It is somewhat inexpensive. The DaVinci Emily scratches pretty easily. Most cribs are easy to assemble and take apart. Attaching the spring for the mattress is where you generally want two people during assembly. For the price, a Graco Lauren is a better deal and I think the Lauren is nicer. My wife prefers the Graco Lauren since it has a drop side. A drop side helps when a baby gets to about 20 pounds. Lifting a child into and out of a crib is sometimes awkward, particularly when they get separation anxiety.The fact that the Emily is convertible is decent. Many cribs are convertible. Many people will have a second child. You can reuse a crib or buy another one if you live in a two story house (one for each floor). A real toddler bed will look nicer than any convertible. Overall, I like convertible cribs since they give you options.Also, don't waste you money on buying a bumper for any crib for an infant under 1.5 years old. They are a proven safety hazard despite that it makes things ""look better"". I'd rather not risk a baby suffocating.",0
"This product is awsome the teething rings go with us every where my daughter (princess) loves them, also I can tell her the multi-colors in spanish and english. I am satisfied with this product",1
"This ball is great!  Colorful, rattle noise, small for little hands and light weight for easy holding.  Rolls for baby to crawl and retrieve, while easily picked up to toss again.I would recommend this product to anyone who has a 1 month to 1 year old baby to buy for.",1
"So, we bought this nifty nursery tool and have been using it for a while now! It's one of those items that doesn't really get on your nerves, but good to have and keep the wipes warm 24/7... I gave it 4 stars, because it does have a few quirks! If you leave the warmer open, it will dry the wipes and become cold... When you pull the wipes out, be sure to pull it out slowly and you'll have a continuous flow of ""Easy Grabs"".  If not, you'll have to open the warmer and just grab from there.  Which can get annoying, because the wipes are stuck together.  Lastly, the wipes on the bottom burns.  Makes it turn yellow and hard.  Over all, it's nice to have around and it's pretty decent.... Just not a 5 star rating item, in my opinion! It does make baby happy and ""Warm!"" (Even when I give her a whole body wipe down) Hehehehe.",1
Purchased with co-ordinating blanket.  Really sweet and not cheap looking.  It looks great in my granddaughter's bedroom and she is 2.5 yrs. now.  recommend,1
"Essential for cloth diapering. We paired this with assorted prefolds just folded into thirds. We've never had a blowout or a soak through. They do wipe off if there's a small amount of poop, and they wash very well.",1
"I have enevr bought anything of this brand and been disappointed! It was a shower gift. It was for a little girl. They were not looking for a bunch of pink, so this was perfect.",1
"Excelent travel system.... Light, easy yo carry, fold and unfold. I highly recomend it. It is a ver y good product.",1
Love it! It is basically an oilcloth diaper changing mat with no padding so it wraps up super small and fits great in my Lillybit diaper clutch with my cloth diapers,1
I was satisfied overall with this kit. I used it on my 8 month old grandson. It's easy to use. I used a large plastic cup to roll in out on the table. I didn't have wax paper. It worked fine. One of my kits the plaster was too dry and hard. I had 4 kits total and didn't trouble to return it. I had extra plaster and actually used one kit for two of baby's handprints.  You do have to press hand firmly which baby wasn't pleased about but results were really cute!  Would recommend!,1
"I bought the Lapinos version of this toy before my daughter was born. Shortly after she was born she started cuddling with it and now she absolutely has to have it to go to sleep at night! The poor toy has been washed, sucked on, spit up on, and much more and still looks and feels great! I highly recommend him for anyone looking for a great bedtime cuddle toy for their baby!",1
"This is a product that should be on every baby registry!  They are great for those changing table accidents.  Instead of taking off the whole changing pad cover you can quickly swap these out and have a new clean one.  This is a great product that not enough people know about. One piece of advice - after washing, allow them to air dry - the backs of them will melt a bit in the dryer (but they're still usable)",1
Baby luvs to sit in the Fisher-Price Jumperoo and laughs and smiles each time.  Headrest is great for smaller babies when they get excited and try to throw their head back.  Must have is the ability to wash the seat.,1
We bought this seat when my son was 18m old. He used it occasionally until he was fully potty trained.This seat is very comfortable and fits small butts.We got a second seat for his school because it is the only one he will use.,1
"Our son loves it, and I think it is hilarious seeing him toddling around chewing on a chicken wing. It was a hit at a family barbeque, too!",1
The description clearly states this is for the new generation Ergo carrier so I was very disappointed when it arrived and didn't fit. It would be perfect if it actually worked. Will be sending back.,0
I bought it for my one year old that was having trouble learning how to tip a cup to get the liquid out due to be a nursing baby. This really helped him learn to tip it. While it was messy it taught him the tipping concept so he now is using the soft top avent sippy cup and is doing great. I have now put this cup back for when he is older and needs to learn how to drink out of a regular cup. Awesome product.,1
"I purchased this car seat in May of 2012 for my newborn son. At first this seat was great--both when used with the base and without. My son is now 4 1/2 months old and we are purchasing a new seat. We were coming home from visiting family the other evening and as we turned the corner to our house (going under 25 MPH), the seat and base tipped over, with my son in it! We stopped to pull him out and check on him and thankfully he was unharmed. We double checked the seat and the base was strapped in correctly and pulled tight. We have no idea how this happened. We have since discontinued use of the base and are purchasing a new car seat for him. I have contacted the company directly to let them know of the problem. We even went to the trouble of having the seat inspected after installation, by an expert, to make sure it wasn't an error on our part. We DID have it installed correctly. WOULD NOT suggest buying this seat until this matter is resolved!In terms of the use we did get from it before this incident--it does not recline and our son seemed very uncomfortable in the position that this seat sits. We bought it because of the padding that the seat came with in comparison to other seats. THAT was the best feature. Would probably not purchase this seat again for another child.",0
Sops up the drooliest of kids output! And really adorable for them to wear all day (except during naps). Snap is nice so my baby's hair doesn't get stuck in velcro.,1
"My baby is 10 months and he weights approximatly 24 lbs. I bought this carrier because from all the reviews it was said it was such a great buy. However they never mentioned how big their child was. I originally had the moby wrap and my baby was getting too big for me to carry him with that and I needed more support and when I bought the Ergo baby there was a difference with how the baby's weight is distributed around hip and shoulders. Overall I can see this carrier is much better than what I had before, the reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because I have back pains after carrying baby for 30 mins. Maybe I'm not used to it. I am 5'2 and 125 lbs :) hope this helps. Also my baby never slept on the moby wrap and with this carrier he takes a good 20-30 mins nap.",1
These shells saved me from severe pain when my baby was a newborn.  They gave me some time to heal and relax.  We have a great nursing relationship because I was able to power through the pain in the very beginning.,1
Perfect for my 3 yr old......we both loved it from the moment we opened the huge box!!!!!! Will be able to  use for years to come.....would highly recommend b/c comfortable and safe!,1
"For my baby shower I got around 8 different types of pacifiers...my newborn daughter wouldn't take any of them.  I asked my friend & she recommended this one.  Bought it recently at Baby's R Us, 2 pk for $4.99 and my baby will finally take it! Yay!",1
"This is the second monitor set we have bought. We have two sets now. We really liked the set for our older child because it has a nightlight with it. This one does not. That being said, the range on this set is very good and the ability to work on two frequencies is a must for us.",1
Medela should package their pumpssupport with this size shield automatically. I really thought pumping was going to be a painful experience until I discovered that the shield size could make such a difference.,1
"I thought I'd try a fancy kind of breast pad and chose these. Usually I use Johnson & Johnson's plain ol pads. After trying these, ""Usually"" has turned in to ""always."" I could actually smell them after a few hours and the packaging is incredibly excessive.",0
"Horrible. I was using it with my Bugaboo Bee Plus mounted on the inside as other reviewers here were recommended. When you install it outside, as the manufacturer recommends, it takes more room and you just end up running into things all the time. When you install it inside then you constantly encounter a problem when tipping the seat all the way back when the seat is front facing. My daughter loves her Safe Sippy 2 which is covered with a rubber/silicon sleeve and we can't use it with the Bugaboo holder because it barely fits into it, first, because the holder is too narrow, second, because the rubber makes it difficult to put it in and pull out. Overall a great disappointment.",0
my little one loves these keys.  they're great for teething and general throwing and banging.  and they're good for him and the environment.  definitely recommend.,1
"I ordered two of these mattress pad overlays for my eight year old daughter who still has a bed wetting problem and often has leaky pull ups at night.  Prior to getting these pads, I was often up 2-3 times a week changing sheets at 2am.  These pads have been a lifesaver for me and have also given my daughter a bit more independence in dealing with her accidents.  She is able to change the pad easily along with her jammies and go back to bed without having to ask for help. She has appreciated having these pads as it makes her feel like ""she can do it"" by herself without having to ask for help with changing her sheets.  I wish I would have ordered these years ago.  Great product!!",1
"My son and husband are loving this! It has reduced my cleanup time as well. I had an issue getting my product at first, but the company sent out another set and it arrived fine. Great customer service! The stickers are staying on. I recommend wiping with alcohol or acetone and letting this dry before putting the stickers on, and try to put them in a spot that is mostly flat (not too curved).",1
I have three kids so I've been through a lot of these crib/toddler bed mattresses.  I got this one for my daughters new toddler sleigh bed.  It fits perfect. It's pretty bouncy and comfortable. I've had expensive toddler matresses and this one is just as thick and good quality as them.  Def. buy this if you're looking for a new crib or toddler mattress.,1
"My son loves his kitty towel. It is super soft.I wish it didn't have the pink collar since I think it's silly (why put a collar on this but not the bear or deer? Did it need to be more gender skewed?), but my son doesn't care and that's the most important thing.",1
"Perfect for a quick trip to the shops, a walk and for Dads to use instead of a diaper bag. It is far less cumbersome than taking my diaper bag to the mall when I have shopping bags to deal with.It's great having everything accessible. When going for a walk, I have my cell phone and house keys in easy reach.The product is good quality as you would expect from Bugaboo. The only comment I have is that it's flimsier than it looks. The weight restriction is correct. It doesn't fit right when overloaded with items and was obviously not designed for that. I can easily fit two diapers, travel wipes, my credit cards, cell phone, keys and one or two small items for baby.I have recommended this product to friends and am happy with my purchase.",1
"My hubbie surprised me the other day with this. It made a really nice ""youre a mother of a 1 year old"" baby gift (he makes up the most random reasons to buy me presents) and i am really happy with this gift! This is my second child and the second time we were in the market for a bunting. I'm coming from the quilted baby bunting (also made by comfy baby) and since my husband knew how much i loved it he was gonna buy me the same one but when he saw they had a new line with inner sherpa he splurged the extra 10 dollars and i am happy he did. This bunting is warm and breathable making me comfortable using it for my baby in any weather. also i dont have to bundle him up in a coat and a bunting like i used to (im a neurotic mommy when it comes to the elements) this bunting is perfectly warm and cozy, all i need to worry about is a hat! Once you go sherpa you never go back!!!",1
Really like this... was worried about the color (bought the vanilla which look really yellow in picture) but it turned out to be a nice cream color and matched well in nursery. Much better then the pad I had originally was going to get.,1
"We purchased two Prince Lionheart formula mixers for our daughter several years ago (the old style that look identical to this product), but found that one wasn't working well when we recently pulled them out of storage to use for our infant son.  I purchased this one as a replacement, but it was also ""dead on arrival"" as another reviewer also stated.  Seriously, brand new batteries and not a single ""whir,"" just completely dead!  Well, my husband took out the motor and swtiched it with one of the Prince Lionheart ones and now both work perfectly!  He said that he thinks the ""contacts were bad"" whatever that means!  I struggled with my rating because it was a completely useless product when it arrived at my door (which would have yielded one star), but now that my husband fixed it, it has become one of those little gadgets that I can't live without (a criterion that would have yielded five stars).  Seriously, when it works, this thing whips up formula like nobody's business, completely eliminating the lumps without creating all of those frothy bubbles.  On the downside, this things eats batteries!  After weighing all of the pros and cons of my experience with this particular product, I've decided to give it three stars.Basically, if you are at all interested in this type of product, I would highly suggest that you look for one (or a similar model) in a local store; that way, if there are any issues, you could return/exchange it without having to deal with the shipping process.",0
"I puchased this for my daughter through another vendor.  I am surprised at how positive the views for this modile are.  Visually, it is great; the sound/music is fine; and my daughter really liked watching it run.  So yes, it was entertaining.  My problem was that it runs ~3 minutes each time you wind it up.  I tried to use it to entertain my daughter while I got ready in the morning.  It ran long enough for me to brush my teeth.  Run back and wind it up as I got dressed.  It didn't run long enough to take a quick shower...let alone blow drying my hair.  Because it didn't work long enough, we ended up getting a second battery operated mobile.  While it clearly wasn't as cute and didn't match our design, it entertained my daughter for 10 minutes and would run for 20 minutes each time.",0
"This car seat is very nice looking.  Unfortunately when installed in our Subaru Outback (2009 model) in the harness configuration the carseat's seat hung over the car's seat by 2-3 inches.  This mean that there wasn't room for my son to put his legs down between his seat and the seat in front.  We tried the middle seat, but he had to put his feet on the center console and that just didn't seem right.Since this is mid-size car we were pretty surprised.  We love Britax and wanted it to work!  Interestingly, we installed it in our older Honda Civic instead and it fit better (hung over the seat by only ~ 1 inch) and was feasible.If you need a shorter seat, check out Recaro ProSport for a similar quality/spec product that will fit better.",0
"Fits great with the medela pump, love that it has extra parts. I use it daily and it is at least as effective and as good as a medela brand pump kit.",1
"I bought the rocker specifically to help my 8 month old daughter nap in the daytime.  She's not much of a napper, so when she napped at a friends house in the previous version of the rocker I immediately wanted to get one.The rocker is very nice, and I don't think it will tip like the previous version is reported to do, but my daughter also doesn't sleep in it.  So much for magic solutions.  But she will sit in it for a little while and play with the toys, so it's not a total loss.",0
"A good product, especially for the length --hard to find. I wish it where a little more ridgid when expanded out all the way, but otherwise it's fine. I use it for a dog fence and seems to work so far.",1
"The motor worked on and off from the day we received it and made it a total of about 3 weeks. Graco customer service was great and sent a replcement motor within 3 days no questions asked (this is a sign), the new motor did not make it through the first day with out failing. One word review... JUNK",0
"I bought this to my 8 month old daughter and she doesn't like it very much. It looks cute but the little balls inside are too small, can't really shake and feel it's weight or hear it's sounds. Would rather have bought a more attractive rattle at the dollar store.",0
I couldn't resist the affordable price and was so happy to open the Amazon box today! What a lovely blanket and packaged beautifully in cellophane wrap with a nice blanket hanger! It's thicker than the regular swaddle and has 2 layers of muslin and is so soft. The size is perfect for baby 44 X 44 inches.,1
"I have bought several strollers over the past few months, many high end and have chosen this one.  It's light, easy to fold and my little one can sit straight up and down and see everything.The basket is large and accessible.  The color is nice - seeing it online made me hesitate at first.So easy to put together - took minutes!",1
"glad I finally found wider nipple brushes now I don't have to use 3 diff brushes to wash the nipples, and straw things (dr. brown bottles)",1
"This is a cute item, however, the box arrived and it was crushed and looked used.  it was intedned as a gift so very embarrassing to have it look like a regift",0
"I'm so glad we bought this monitor. It's made being a new, first-time parent much less worry-riddled. We can see our son clearly no matter how dark in the room, thanks to the night vision setting. It's much clearer than other monitors, some of which go fuzzy or have static. I love that the sound only kicks in to turn on when baby makes a noise, saving batteries and not just unnecessarily playing our own white noise machine for us. We've found it easy to use and would purchase again.",1
"When I got this stroller I was amazed how well made it is! I had a quest before, I loved it, until I saw this, I was like: wow! You do get what you are paying for! I just wish maclaren can come up with some better colors! Also, I notic that this stroller  is quite big, I am 5&#34;6. I still think it is a little tall for me, it fits taller parents better for sure! I was going to return it because its size, however after I read more reviews, people seems really adore this one over other models, so I decided to keep it and give it a try! We will see.",1
"I gave this mobile three stars for multiple reasons.  First off it looks rather 'cheap'.  I bought this during one of Amazon's Christmas Sales for only $9.00 so it was worth it but if I would have paid $40.00 I would have been angry and returned it!  The music on it works but the tune of Mary Had A Little Lamb goes way too fast and at first it would not work at all, I had to thump on it several times before it would start playing.  I also don't like the crib attachment on it, it is way too big so I am going to suspend it from the ceiling over the babies crib and then it will be just fine.  My baby has not been born yet so I can't comment on how he or she will like it but I think that it will work out okay.  I also like the fact that it matches my nursery decor.  I am not using the nursery accessories from this brand, I am making my own.  But my nursery is yellow with an animal theme, so this looks good with it.  ....I will take some photos of this with my digital camera soon and post them so that you can see better the crib attachment and what the animals look like.",0
The backpack was the right size for the 3 1/2 year old boy.  It was well made and the colors were vibrant.,1
"I purchased these to give to my daughter-in-law and her sister who will be delivering for Christmas and March of 2013 respectively.  These were a great help when I had my children 20+ years ago. They are not widely heard of. I found that they were great in easing the discomfort of when the milk first comes in.  They can be put in the refrigerator for cool relief, and are great to ease the tenderness of the nipple area.(especially for first time mothers) Since they have not been used yet from this next generation.... I guess I may have to update this when I get their opinions.",1
bought this for  grand nephews and they love the toy. It is small enought for their little hands and holds their attention..,1
"I love it, it was a perfect gift for my daughter and her new baby. Beautiful Pepperpot Baby Record Book, Sweet Tweets Girl",1
"Convenient and useful and everyone knows it. Daddy loves them. They're his go-to 'bottles' for feeding LO. We reach for these when we travel, and bring only one nurser and a couple nipples. They don't take up much space as well, especially if you stack them in the nurser.",1
"This is a very sturdy product that will definitely hold a toddler and 200-lb parent for bedtime reading. The color is nice and the quality good. However, assembly was difficult for an individual because the slats slide out easily while installing. The process took 45 minutes, but would have been a half hour or less for two people. Overall good investment.",1
These are the best utensils for toddlers hands down.  They are the easiest for them to manage and my 2 year old prefers them!  This is the second set we bought!,1
"We have been using Avent pacifiers from day one, so we know they come in twos. So,a standard pack of Avent pacifiers is two pacifiers. So when I saw this advertised as a 2 pack, I naturally assumed I would get 4 pacifiers, especially when the picture shows 4 pacifiers!!! Not so. This is just a singular pack of pacifiers for way too much money. I feel duped.",0
MAM pacifiers are my favorite and these are very pretty as well as being functional.  The variety available in the stores are ugly and busy.  These are soft and tasteful.,1
"While I can't speak to this mattress compared to any others, I've had one for 2 years and just received a second for my baby on the way. It is firm without being hard. I definitely like the foam versions of kid mattresses. I did notice the latest mattress seems to fit much tighter than my original one, but this could be just from use. It fits in my pottery barn cribs very well, and leaves 0 gap. Another plus is that it isn't super heavy so changing sheets is easy. Overall, no negatives that I see.",1
"I was introduced to this sweet toy when my infant granddaughter received the &#34;girl&#34; version for a gift. It sits in her crib and gets played every night as part of the bed-time routine. I love the child-voice that recites the prayer. So when my great-nephew was baptized, I bought this for him. I understand it was shown around to all the guests, his parents were so delighted.",1
"So cute.  Baby doesn't love it yet (she's only 4 months), but I think she really will.  I like how the head bobbles and squeaks.  Not as good as the giraffe.  The long neck and legs on the giraffe help baby hold it and give lots of nooks to chew.  Still, a nice toy.",1
"What a great idea, to protect your power strip.  Wish i had one of these growing up and could have prevented a lot of nights being sent to my room without dinner.",1
This changing pad is the best changing pad you can buy.  It is a little expensive but you will use it for years and it will always look the same.  Very durable and very easy to pack in your diaper bag.,1
"My son is a very tall three years old.  We have been trying to get him to use the toilet for the past few months and we were meet with nothing but resistance.  I bought this chair because it was taller than most, it looked comfortable to sit on and most importantly, it would be easy to clean.  When the chair arrived he was excited that it was HIS chair and sat on it for a few minutes.  The very next morning he asked if he could sit on his potty chair.  So we did.  Nothing, but he was obviously enamored with it. (I had promised him that he could decorate it with stickers) He insisted that we take it to my mom's house and later that day, unprompted, he peed in the potty.  We were so excited! Now imagine how it was later that evening when he actually pooped in the potty, again unprompted.Now I do think that my son may have been afraid of our very tall toilets and didn't like the fact that he had to have help getting on and off. Little Mr. Independence is now doing it all by himself.  Yes! THIS is THE chair you need to get!  I am one happy, happy mommy!",1
So I've had both the original and performance models for about 2 weeks and I had the hardest time making up my mind which I liked best! The performance is MUCH more lightweight compared to the bulky canvas of the original. BUT I called ergobaby and was given lots of info from the actual person who answered the phone (not a recording!) and she told me the performance doesn't work well in the hip position since the arms are contoured...that helped me to make my final decision! We have a 2 month old boy- (14 lb) who is in the 95% percentile and I've been using just the pillow under his bottom from the infant insert which is just too bulky for my taste and too hot for us both!! He LOVES the original but not crazy about the performance!! But I on the other hand am only 5 foot and have a really short torso but felt the performance fit me better..........LOOONNG story short....I ended up buying the Original organic- I get it tomorrow! Hoping the different material but in the original design will meet my needs!Overall... due to large breasts...thanks Baby!! LOL!= I REALLY need good back support in a carrier and after wearing this one all day and feeling like I wasn't even carrying a chunky monkey....I've stopped the hunt for the perfect carrier. My ONLY con is I wish baby could face out in the front position. but I have a feeling we'll mainly be using the hip position once he gets older...for now...this seems to get him to sleep and calm him quickly! Ergobaby has a loyal customer here!!,1
"Baby likes to play, always with her little hands to try to let it turn up! Turn up watching the colorful, very happy! Thank you, let me so happy baby",1
"Wish I could give these 3.5 stars.  These blocks are good sized and stack-able. The smallest block (Green) has a textured teething ""apple"".  The Blue block has a butterfly with crinkle wings that stick out.  The Red block is just a basic block.  Each block has photos, artwork, and patterns--no repetition on any side or between blocks.  Each block is color coordinated and there are themes between the blocks.  I imagine some research went into the patterns and themes and it's designed specifically to stimulate babies, because Baby Einstein Toys are known for that kind of thing.  The blocks hold their shape well, but when pressure is applied they collapse on themselves so baby can't use them to climb out of a playpen.  They pop right back up when pressure is released.  The stitching forms a nice ridge along several of the edges to help baby grip the blocks.  They seem kind of pricy and my 11 month old mostly plays with the teether, but when he's into stacking, this set will probably get more use.",1
"I've been eying Skip Hop toys for awhile, they're all so cute. So I got this for my 6 month old, he doesn't seem to care much for it so far. It is really cute and well made, but I think I like it more than he does. He's not one to sit still for long periods of time so this might not be the right toy for us anyway.The 'book' has a crinkly page, two finger puppets, and a rubber teether. It doesn't have any words, though. It's a nice opportunity to make up your own story about the animals. I'm going to keep trying to get him interested. Hopefully he'll like it as much as me eventually!",0
"my daughter had this saucer since 3 months old. we would put her in there once she had head control with blankets around her and she loved the colors. as she got older she loved it more and more.and its nice to move the the toys around she loved everything on it for a diffrent reason great to teeth on the frog and flag. highly recomend it, it was also nice when we would travel to take it with with out filling your car the folding part is a snap!!!!!! i was somewhat leary at first lets face its not cheap in price but once you have it you will say its worth every penny. my daughter will be 1 on oct11th and she still uses it. she bounces that thing like i have never seen a child due thank god it can with stand it!",1
"It is the rights size for the 4x6 photo it advertises, and has a substantial texture. Did not notice if there is any glass. It is also padded from the frame, meaning that it does not look cheap. This was an excellent gift (for a brand-new grandpa, who else?)with a photo of my newborn in it. Highly recommend.",1
just what i needed to keep water out of babies eyes when washing her hair.thanks,1
so i bought this to put snacks in but my son ends up just playing with it. He is 1 so I hope to one day use it for it's actual use. Until then it is great to give him during meal time because it washes easily. I do think it is sort of hard to get an adult hand in and out of it and I wish it came apart to wash easier.,1
"My son got this as a gift last Christmas.  It lasted 3 weeks, and broke down.  He was so sad, and it was really cute while it worked.  He loved watching it as he fell asleep.  Unfortunately we couldn't find replacement bulbs or fuses. The sizes used are very unusual, and even online I had trouble finding what we needed. I even took the parts to two hardware stores to see if they could order them.  No one could. Such a disappointment!",0
"I bought the gate over a year ago. Gate was easy to install, is steady and strong. Great for kids and pets.",1
"Lids didn't fit securely and came off too easily, causing at least one milk disaster.",0
I bought these to keep toddler from getting into a stand alone cabinet and toilets. To date I have only used on toilets and they work great.  No exact measurements needed for install due to adjustable strap.  Stays stuck to a porcelain toilet side and plastic lid.  12 month old boy has tried to pry open with hands and has not been successful so far.  The latch is relatively easy release with a two button squeeze but does take some finger strength. Be aware during install which side will have the strap hanging from it.  I Have not been brave enough to adhere to nice wood cabinet because I am afraid of having to remove it in the future.,1
Good quality. Nice color ad features. Very practical. We are all satisfied with the product. It fit the windows of the car. It could be a bit wider.,1
"I received the packages and the items were well packed.  Recommend you wipe down before constructing as there is a little factory dust remaining on the item as to be expected.  The play activity center has its own battery already installed.  All you need to do is pull the tab on the back side to activate.  I like others who reviewed purchased two of these kits.  It fits nicely in the center of a room or can be customized with curves and bends to meet the required pattern within reason.  The gate latches are secure from child using them, but I rather hop over the sides but no sure it sets such a good example.  Will have to work the latches a little more to get accustomed to using.  I do not feel like it will tip over, but my 9 mos old at the first day in the play pen was able to push the panels a bit.  there are rubber feet on each of the panels and if you put them on a solid floor would provide a little adherence.  I choose to get the rubber mat flooring.  Oh yeah, if you buy two pen kits, you will most likely need two sets of the panels as you do not want the puzzle piece ends inside the pen.",1
"We had a Honda mini-van that had these type of shades built in, but our new vehicle didn't have this option.  My son missed this greatly and was very excited to get this shade.  It simply works.  We've had no problem with it, and it provides the comfort from the sun that my son wanted.",1
"I was waiting for the Fisher Price Luv U Zoo Jumperoo, but it has been out of stock for a while.  I wanted that based on the reviews, but I was worried about timing since my son seemed ready for one.  I was a bit hesitant since others noted that the Baby Einstein Jumper didn't have a lot of bounce, but I bought it.  I'm glad I did.  I see no problems with the jump factor.  My son is still getting used to using his legs, but he loves all the toys.  The extra loops to place your own toys are great.  The jumper is solid, and I'm sure my baby will love using it once he figures out that he can jump on his own.",1
My wife and I were skeptical at first because of the price. I mean $15 for a rubber Giraffe. Because of all the great reviews we decided to get it anyway. Our daughter is 5 1/2 months old and she will chew on Sophie's legs for a half and hour without a problem. Anyway needless to say we love Sophie and recommend it highly.,1
I purchased this item because I wanted good protection of our coffee table for our daughter -- and because I knew that she would spend a lot of time probably chewing on it I wanted it to be PVC free.  I selected this one even though it was pricy because the description said it was PVC-free.  I was upset therefore when I received the item in the mail and read on the tag that it is made of 100% PVC material.  What!  I'll return it for cheaper item.,0
"its a nice colour, easy to store and use, it handles great, the seat is comfortable and sits in place, although my son hates his car seat i absolutely love it, it was a great buy, worth every penny!",1
"Personally, I have a boppy and a cuddle-u, and I prefer the boppy. The boppy is not only fluffier, but has a removable cover. (I know that they now make reusable covers for the cuddle-u, but my boppy came with the cover.)But the BIGGEST reason that I prefer the boppy is the very reason I bought the cuddle-u: that incredibly obnoxious ""strap"" that holds the baby in.As it turns out, not only did I not use the strap, but I ended up in a constant battle with the thing. Every time I would grab it for a middle of the night feeding, the strap would end up out and spread across my bed, and I'd have to roll it back up and stick it back in the pocket. (Where it would stay until the next feeding, at which point it would escape again.)Needless to say, the strap lost the battle at about 2 months, when I cut it off with a pair of scissors after a particularly difficult night.It may be cheaper than the boppy, but I'd spend the extra money to avoid the extra fabric.",0
My daughter loves this. The quality is great and the toys are perfectly spaced for her to grab. Would buy again!,1
"While my daughter enjoys this toy at times, she never uses it as a teether. She always ends up getting the other side (the rattle) into her mouth and she enjoys sucking on that much more. But the toy is well made and the quality is excellent.I do want to point out, however, that water got into the rattle when I washed it. And needless to say, it never dried up.",1
works great for me and comfy for my baby. I'm very short and a full figured woman and its very easily adjusted,1
"My three month old was fascinated with the different colors and textures.  The lion made by Lamaze is still her very favorite, but this one is great too.",1
I buy this for all my baby shower gifts.  This pillow is more firm than any other pillow to breast feed.,1
Great baby album and the pages are easy for little ones to flip with the cutouts.  Only complaint is that the picture frame on the cover fell off and we had to glue it back it on.,1
"I bought this stroller because of its good reviews.Let me start with the Pros.1.  The stroller is very easy to collapse.  You can do this with one hand.2.  The basket under the stroller is very spacious, so you can put your diaper bag there.Cons:1.  The back wheels are wobbling already after only 6 months of use.  It first started with the left rear, now both wheels are wobbling.  Don't know when it'll fall off, but since I spent ~$250 on it, i guess I'll use it until the wheels fall off, literally.2.  Not enough space between the break bar and my feet.  During walks, you'll keep kicking the bar, which is a bit annoying.3.  Heavy.  My wife has a hard time putting it into the trunk.4.  Big even folded.  Good thing I have a van.  If you have a car (like my wife's camry, you can forget about putting anything else in the trunk once the stroller is in there.Overall, I didn't expect a $250 stroller to break down so fast.  I wouldn't buy another Joovy again.",0
"We got this travel system from BRU. I hated it from the first time i saw it. the infant car seat is not breatheable, the material made my little one sweat and cry excessively. the seat belt is poorly made . the stroller does not recline and the material is also not good.I gave it out and looking forward to get a better- even if more pricey car seat for my baby.I guess you get what you pay for.",0
"Love this, and it works well!! I cannot picture myself using anything else.  I am a person who hates anything out of place, and first thought that this will be a problem, it wasn't!  It slides right against the toilet and you don't even realize that it is there.  Hiding in plain sight:)",1
We were absolutely pleased with the unique design and soft baby colors of these tie on valances.  They look absolutely delightful in my new grand daughter's nursery!Crown Crafts How Does Your Garden Grow? Window Valance,1
"The packaging of new Playtex ""VentAire"" bottles proclaims that ""Air vents through bottom vent, so air doesn't mix with liquid as baby drinks"" and ""...virtually NO AIR mixes with the milk.""If you look at the bottle from the outside, it's easy to see how this should work.  There is a ring of tiny holes at the bottom, through which air could conceivably flow.  However, when I actually tried the bottle, a substantial amount of air flowed through the nipple as it was emptied, just like a regular bottle.  I noticed that there is a silicone ""vent"" inside the bottle, so I thought perhaps I needed to remove this before use to get the vents to work.  This stops the flow of air through the nipple, yet without it, liquid simply drips through the nipple so no suction is required at all to drink.  And indeed, the packaging instructions say that the vent should be in place during feeding.It seems like the technology still needs a little tweaking to work as advertised.  The main problem seems to be with the vent blocking the holes too much even when heavy suction is applied.  Still, I have no complaints about the quality of the bottles, material, or construction, so they are a reasonable choice even if the technology doesn't work as advertised.",0
I love my lunch bag.  I get so many questions about the &#34;scary looking skulls&#34;  so many people have no clue.  This is very durable and wipes up very well.  The price was perfect for what I was looking for,1
It syncs with the color video monitor Even though it says black and white..buy this one its cheaper! Love it! I have 3 month old and 15 month old... This works great.,1
"It is not plush. Easy to wash, I suppose.For the price, I guess it is not bad. But it should cost five dollars instead.",0
"I purchased this for my four month old grand nephew and it has become his favorite toy. He loves the crinkling sound of the flap as well as the mirror that is exposed when the flap is raised. With all of the loops and rings, it is easy for him to hold. Highly recommend.",1
"My baby boy loved it, the book is great so he can play with it all over the house.  Nice material.",1
"Awesome jogging stroller! I highly recommend it! I am a runner and it is a great easy ride for my son. Perfect for trail runs or just your everyday sidewalk run. Light weight and the suspension makes for a smooth ride. If you don't want to pay the money for a bob stroller, this is just as great or better!! I love this stroller!!",1
This was what I was looking for to make a decorative pillow for my grand-daughter.  It matched her crib set that I made into a quilt for her twin bed now that she had to give the crib to her baby-brother.,1
"Works exactly for what I needed it to do. Hold bathroom toys, makes it easier to keep bathroom tiddy and clean.",1
Set-up is very easy and the picture quality is much bette than expected. Love the feature of singing lullaby and detecting the room temprature. Though by initial testing I just felt the motion/sound detector seems too sensitive. Even a tiny sound triggered the video transmission. But maybe a good thing once bb arrives and help prevent anything needs worries.,1
I bought this bib for a friend's son. It is durable and a nice shade of blue. The best part is the saying. It has illicited many laughs and everyone wants to know where it was purchased.,1
"I purchased this car seat based upon reviews. My 16 month old is very comfortable in this seat. It has good padding, support and air protect. I was concern that it would not fit in my car but I had no problems.",1
My daughter loves this mobile. I bought it because it plays continuous music for 40 minutes. She will watch it for longer than that. The music is entertaining. The toys go around and spin. Best money I have spent on entertainment for her yet.,1
I got this for my almost 3 month old at the time. At first she had a hard time keeping it in her mouth. But now that she is 3 months and is use to it she loves it. She likes to take it out of her mouth and put it back in all by herself! Great buy,1
"Excellent little freezer trays with lids.  BPA free and easy to use. We use them daily.  ...seems I need to write some more words before the system will take my review, so that's it.",1
"I registered for and received the Clic It stroller as a gift.  What can I say...it does everything I expected it to, but nothing else.On the positive side, my Safety 1st 35 Air carseat fits perfectly and it is very light and easy to load and unload into/from the trunk.  I use it primarily while running errands with my car.  It works best in stores that have wider aisles and tile/marble floors (as opposed to carpet).  The cup holders are great and the little snap close compartment on the handle is very useful.  The breaks are easy to put on and easy to take off, even in flipflops.On the room for improvement side, this stroller is inexpensive and it handles like it was inexpensive.  I have a great jogging stroller that turns on a dime and moves without even trying but it cost $400 and weighs 30 pounds.  This one is $60 and really light, but don't plan to drive it one-handed.  I am constantly running into shopping fixtures and small differences in pavement cause it to stop short.  Curbs are a big burden...forget stairs unless you have a partner to help.  I can't open mine one-handed--though I haven't found that to be a severe limitation.  One small but huge annoyance is the inability to access the carrying bin underneath without taking off the infant seat.  Inevitably, pacifiers end up in the bottom of the diaper bag which you can't access without a lot of work.So, in conclusion, this stroller frame is what it is.  I use it daily when running errands, etc, but I use our big stroller if I'm planning on walking somewhere in our town.  It has served us well in the first 3 months (even surviving being checked luggage during a flight) but I won't miss it when my son grows out of the infant seat.",0
"I had this carrier when my first was born.  She never really liked it and it killed my back and shoulders.  It wasn't until I read in depth research and information on how Bjorn carriers are not good for infant's hip and spine development, that I stopped using it and purchased an Ergo.  There are better, SAFER and HEALTHIER, baby wearing carriers on the market!",0
"Love Snoopy, love the sheet and so does the baby. Just wish it had a white or ivory background for little girls",1
Excellent.thank you :) would definately buy again. Work well on walls and very colorful. I think my daughter and i will definately enjoy them!,1
"My son has CP and this is one of his favorite toys. We've had it for about a year and he never gets tired of it. He plays with it almost everyday. It's great for CP kids, teaches them to use tools (the hammer) and they can play with one or both hands.",1
This item is ok. I wish it was a little longer and the snap is really hard to buckle and unbuckle.,0
Easy to put on while providing a sense of style! My son is always kicking his shoes off. So these work perfect!,1
"This hook is perfect for carrying my diaper bag, key rings, baby toys that have a loop, or even a really heavy grocery basket. Note: please make sure there is enough weight distributed on the other end of the stroller as you add items as not to flip baby out!!!The grip is soft and the clamp is easy to open and close but is not loose where it is easily opened. I love the green, it is my favorite color and matches the other green I have going on in my stroller and diaper bag (really just a personal preference).Overall, very functional and handy thing to have! Not heavy or bulky to keep attached all the time.",1
"I am sorry that everyone else has had a horrible experience with their monitors and the shortcomings with the product. I cannot speak for them but I can say that this has been a wonderful product for my wife and I. We received this monitor as a gift over 6 months ago and it works just as good as the day we got it! Yeah, it is a bummer that the battery does not come with the unit, which I thought was unusual, and the reception is good up to about 50 feet, with the occasional flicker on the screen, but I am rating the overall satisfaction of the product, and from my own personal experience, I have enjoyed watching my son sleep every night through a large, clear, zoomable, screen. I do feel that for the price, they could have thrown in the battery, but it is a decent monitoring unit none the less and I would recommend this product.",1
"I just received my PumpEase bra and all I can say is that I SO wish I had discovered this product sooner!  I had previously purchased several nursing tanks with the built-in hands free pump layer.  While I like the idea of a two-in-one solution the reality was that the two-layer design was awkward and uncomfortable (not to mention lumpy under my clothes).  I recently went back to work and was thinking I needed to invest in several pumping bras/tanks to rotate through the week so that I didn't have to basically disrobe each time I wanted to pump to put the tank on.  What I love about the PumpEase is that I can just wear any bra and when I need to pump I can just lift my shirt, lower the cup on my bra, and strap the PumpEase on... so easy!  What's better is that I can just throw the PumpEase into my Pump-in-Style bag so it's always handy when I need to pump.  Love it! And because I only need one I am saving SO much money versus purchasing 5-7 pumping tanks at $40/piece.With regard to the product design itself--- I love the fabric!  As others have said similar to a swimsuit fabric but double-layered so it won't lose it has quite a bit of support and won't fall down or lose its elasticity.- I purchased the blue polkadot fabric and love it.  Very fun and hard to lose in the pile of laundry!- It seems very well constructed.  I like the eye-hook closure.- Very comfortable to wear.- Works perfect with my Medela breastpump.Overall a great investment.  Do yourself a favor and buy this and don't waste your money on anything else!",1
"i also had the exactly same experience mentioned my 'Rick Johnson' in his review. Now that when i try to return the item, they say that i should bear the shipping cost????? Why should a consumer bear the cost when a fake item was delivered for which we paid the full amount?This is a clear case of cheating and i guess Amazon should take strict action against sellers who sell fake items, else Amazon is also going to end up as a site to trade fake items like ebay.Please do not buy this from this seeler, instead buy it from some authorized retailer so that you do not get cheated",0
We use these for all stinky diapers prior to placing into the containment chamber (diaper pail) they do a pretty good job of keeping things contained so that we don't have to empty the pail every day. Without them we had to! They're also good for when walking the dog. There are cheaper alternatives that work just as good but I was always happy with these.,1
The product is of poor quality and does not work well. You hear a lot of static that can not hear the baby well. I do not recommend buying it.,0
"I got the booginhead pacigrips because the attach easily to the soothie pacifiers which is the only one my child would take. The clasp on the other end grips easily, It rarely detaches on its own unless you really yank on it. Its better than some of the other plastic grips that break, or fall off easily. My child enjoys the feeling of the ribbon and rubs it while she has her pacifier, Its comforting to her. I got one booginhead at a yardsale and three weeks after my daughter arrived I ordered a few more! I love them!",1
"I've had a mixed experience with this seat. When we first brought my baby home from the hospital we often let him take a nap in this seat, and he seemed comfortable (we put a soft head rest in to make it extra comfortable). But within 1-2 weeks he started to hate it and it got no use for almost a month. My boy is a big/long baby and he would just thrash around, don't think he liked the angle so much or the way he had to scrunch up his legs to sit in it.However, now at 3 months of age I use it daily. If I had to choose between this and a standard bouncer seat I would choose the bouncer in a heartbeat, I think they are more comfortable for babies and they tend to come with toy bars. I added my own ""toy arch"" across this seat, and that has been wonderful, but it's too bad no such arch came with the product. Also, be aware it doesn't vibrate, play music, or have any other bells and whistles.What is NICE about this seat, is that it is higher than a bouncer. If you want to stand at the kitchen sink or see baby (and let baby see you) while standing up or sitting in a chair, this is really nice to have around. But again, I still use a regular bouncer MORE than this chair.Personally, I would not let my baby sleep in this at night. It seems a bit hard, and the incline is a bit steep, especially for a wabbling newborn neck. If you don't want to use a crib and want an incline, the Starlight Fisher Price Papasan Swing is totally awesome -soft, cozy, and will go all night when plugged in. I've now had two babies spend their early months sleeping in that, and both have been great sleepers. Transitioning to a matress later was not as hard as you might think either.If you have the spare money or get this as a gift, it is a nice/enjoyable item to have, but it's not ""essential"" or even the best in my personal opinion. Oh, one last pro though...it is light and easy to move around. Hope these comments help in deciding whether this product is a good fit for you!",1
"my 8 month old love this toy! ..... the music is wonderful .... and sounds great! best to put the cube on the floor for your baby to sit up and play. this is great gift for any reason..... the only thing i would want to see improvement in. is to make the volume adjustable, which it's only on one level loud ..... i don't mind it...... my husband tends to yell back at it .... and i sit and laugh !!!",1
I was thrilled to find this product. It was something I had not be able to find locally and I purchased several rechargeable batteries to go with it. :),1
This is the best hing ever invented.  I want one for myself.  It works great and my son LOVES the fresh food!,1
"I really love this crib.  My husband didn't have any trouble putting it together.  The only thing that was kind of bothersome was finding a non-standard mattress.  The dimensions need to be at least 27 1/4"" by 51 5/8"", but the mattress can't be thicker than 6"". This size fits perfectly in the crib.  I wouldn't change the crib at all. :)",1
"It is true. . . this pump is not quiet.  However, if you don't have to worry about who hears and you are pumping to have bottles for convienence out and about etc., then this pump is good for you.  I am a stay at home mom and I pump to have bottles for outings and so daddy can feed the baby sometimes.  It works perfect for that and is much more economical than some other ones.  I can pump about 5 to 6 oz in about 10 - 15  minutes (I am sure this varies depending on each person's supply) and the pump is comfortable to use. I have only had it about a week so, I can't comment about other people's comments that the motor stops working after only 2 months.",1
"I bought the roundabout for the same reasons everyone else did...safety.  I don't mind spending the money to assure my son's safety.  The evenflow seat received just as many safety marks, but everyone seems to like the roundabout so I bought it.  I haven't had many problems with the seat and have been generally happy until today.I went to switch the seat to forward facing and the recline bar wouldn't click in the forward position.  I called the company and they agreed to fix it, but I have to send the seat and they will have it for over a week.  They refuse to send me a replacement or temporary seat.  I can't be without a car seat for over a week.  So I have to purchase a second seat to have this one repaired.  Does that make sense??  They also speculated that I broke it installing it too tightly.  Does that make sense either.  I of course kneeled on the seat (as recommended) to get a tight fit, but I only weight 130lbs.  I am so disgusted with the lack of help and customer service that I will not buy another seat and will be purchasing the Evenflow that all my friends love, is equally as safe and their children are all very comfortable in.  It actually is better padded than the Britax.  I am a very unhappy consumer and hope you don't have a problem with your seat.",0
I love using this for soiled clothing to go between daycare and home.  My daycare uses plastic bags and this alternative is great for the environment.,1
"I bought this when (or maybe even before) my daughter was born. She is 4 now, and still sleeps with this giraffe. She doesn't really rub the tags like I've heard other kids like to do, but she likes the tags to carry it around, with her finger. I would definitely recommend this product for an expecting mother or small child.",1
"I bought this mattress for my grandson's new toddler bed and I was impressed with its quality, considering what I paid for it.  It was a pleasant surprise.",1
"I bought this monitor set because it had the walkie-talkie ability, thought it was cool.  At the time I had a 3 year old who needed guidance at times to go to sleep for naps and didn't want to have to keep going into her room to get her attention.  I also had a baby on the way and was going to transition it to his room once he was born, unfortunately the unit stopped working before he was even a month old.  Even when it was working I thought the volume on it was very low and hard to hear at times as well.  There was no apparent reason it stopped working and I'm not into wasting money twice, so opted to by a new Graco model and love that monitor.",0
My granddaughter sleeps better on this sheet vs the scratchy cotton ones. Washed up nicely and fits the crib mattress well.,1
"We have been using G-diapers reusable diapering system for nearly 16 months now.We first used the g-liners.  They worked.But I wanted a cheaper option, so I bought these.And actually... at first... they were not that great.A bit TMI here but...Before your babys movement get solid, these things are pretty pointless.  The g-liners are much better during that time frame, because they are more paper like and the more liquid movements don't do right through the g-liner paper liners like they do with these.HOWEVER...once your baby has solid movements these are a much better performer.They catch all the hard bits and allow the pure liquids to more readily get absorbed into the diaper pad.As I said... we started with g-liners.  Swapped to the Cuteybaby liners.  Wife said she wanted to go back to g-liner... but after that change we both agreed the cuteybaby worked much better once movements became solid.",1
MY SON LOVES THIS HE USE TO HATE TAKING BATHS NOW I CANT GET HIM OUT WISH THE  BUBBLES WERE EASIER TO FIND TO REPLACE,1
The crib was easy to put together and seems well constructed for the price.  I would have given 5 stars except for the fact that the screws are clearly visible after assembly.  Recessing them and providing the wood covers would give this crib a much nicer finished look.,1
New base - works like the old base...This is an identical item to the original as shipped with the B-Safe car seat.,1
"We love this potty seat! Our daughter was terrified of getting pinched with the round seats because they didn't fit on our oval toilet very well. I ordered this and she stopped being afraid of the potty! She uses it daily. It's very easy to remove if needed, and super easy to wipe clean!",1
"If the Tilty cup came with soft tips and handles, this cup would be perfect.  My son has a hard time lifting the cup and prefers softer tipped sippy cups.  Great design though!",0
"We love this blanket!  All of my three children have one and it is by far their very favorite.  My twins are now 6 years old and have been sleeping with this blanket since day one.  The quality is excellent and in all this time the blankets are still soft and the satin is still intact and in great shape.  My 19 month old's blanket still feels and looks like new, it's her favorite too!  She won't sleep without it!  We are expecting another baby and am definitely going to be purchasing another Katie Little luxury blanket.",1
"This was advertised as a fit for Britain b-agile. I purchased a new model b-agile in 2012. And unless there is an adjustment on the stroller I haven't found or read of, this barely/truly doesn't fit the stroller. For advertised I would not expect all the necessary tugging. And I would expect a thicker more durable cover",0
"My daughter is a tall 31/2 year old. When in the car seat her legs hang or she attempts to squish them on the 1 inch border of seat not covered by her car seat. I had attempted boxes, bags.... to help keep her feet from hanging but they were always in the way. The Car Seat Footrest and Booster Seat Footrest is perfect.  Her feet now rest comfortably and car rides are more enjoyable. She wasn't complaining about her feet, but once we installed the footrest, on the first trip she said, ""mom, I like the table.""  I plan to use this when I move her to a booster seat as well.  Even better, it can easily be adjusted and even folded down.  I can't help but think about how it feels to have my feet dangling for long periods of time vs propping them up on a foot rest.  Another plus was that it was easy to install.",1
"This is by FAR the best price-per-bag I've ever found for disposal bags, either in the little rolls, or just a big box of bags. They work great!  The scent isn't overpowering, they seem to contain the smell, and they're long enough to tie a knot. However, a couple of minor problems:-The center of the spool is cardboard, and isn't quite long enough to work properly in my little Munchkin-brand holder. It stays in well enough to un-roll bags, but I can't rotate the end of the holder to re-spool bags when pulled out too far. Not a huge deal. So far, one roll worked, and the others haven't.-The opening of these bags is a little narrower than some other bags I've had, so I have to wrap the diaper a little smaller. Again, not a big problem. I think some of the other brand bags are way too big and are a waste.Overall, if you're on the fence, go for it and buy these. It is so much cheaper than other options that it's worth the drawbacks.",1
I have the Chicco Lullaby LX and I found that this sheet is soft and fits perfectly.  I also put a liner pad down under the sheet and there is room for that as well.  The sheet washes and dries well and I have had no issues with shrinkage yet after about 4 months.  The color is pretty and I haven't had any problems with bunching yet.,1
"I didnt read te otem clearly i thought it was the lamp and shade , the price fpr the shade was high i think for it being so small i thught it was the lamp and shade io read it wrong, but it went with the bedding. i would n recommend this item for the price and size",1
"It looks beautiful but my toddler likes to take it apart time and time again.  And then the cats started using it for a scratching post which makes a huge mess.  So if you don't have cats or a toddler who likes to take things apart, this might work for you but it didn't for me.",0
I've only been using this for about a week so far but I really enjoy this diaper wipes spray. I am using it with cloth diapers and flannel wipes. It has a very pleasant smell and the spray bottle is a nice size for handling. The price of this individual spray bottle is pretty high however so I am ordering a bottle of the concentrate to mix my own for the next round. So far this bottle is already half gone and I've only been using it for about a week and a half! But I am really new at this so I might be using too much. Perhaps I'll become a little more proficient with more practice!I am not sure if this spray is magical in any way or if I could actually make something just as good myself. I am sure I could - I can't really justify spending this much on diaper wipes spray when my whole reason for cloth diapering was to save money in the first place. So we'll see how long the concentrate bottle lasts me. This was a good way to try it out though to see if I liked it - and I plan on re-using the bottle for mixing my concentrate so I am glad I got this size for that reason as well. It really is a good size and shape of bottle for one handed use and storage too. So I don't regret my purchase of this smaller bottle - good way to try it out and great bottle.,1
"Why buy an ugly, clunky plastic toddler bed when you can have a cute natural wood bed for less money. This one arrived quickly and was easy to put together (my 14 year old did it) and fit perfectly where the crib had been. Pleased with this purchase.",1
"My 6 month old has never taken to pacifiers so when I first heard about these teethers I assumed she wouldn't like them. Boy, was I wrong! She started daycare and they had some of these. I went to pick her up one day and she was just knawing away at one of the raz-berry teethers. I asked the daycare provider if she usually chews on these and she said that she did all the time. I decided to buy some for the house and am so glad I did. My daughter absolutely loves these! We have other teethers that she will chew on, but she seems to be content with these ones for the longest period of time. We attached a pacifier clip on one to prevent her from dropping it too. Love these teethers and this dual pack is a great value!",1
"My little one loves this pillow - it's perfect for nap time at her preschool.  Nice that you can take the case off and wash it, too.",1
Works ok with my new medela pump and style. The valves bend easily and are not as good but the rest works nicely. Iay use medela valves on these.,1
"I buy this for my Mom who has dementia and has been wearing diapers for 4 years. She never has irritation for long when we use Anti Monkey Butt powder right away! The powder has calamine in it so it attacks diaper rash before it starts. If we have a particularly bad day and irritation has started, this will clear it up. It smells good and lasts a long time.",1
"I love the idea of these cups, they really are completely hands free.  Those pumping bras are not practical, they don't really hold up the bottles once you get any amount of milk in them and they are just difficult to deal with.My one issue is the size or contour of the cup that is supposed to conform to you breast and nipples.  I ordered the 25mm, because my medela was 24mm, so either the curvature is different than my medela, because I've never had an issue with the medela, or they are just a different sizing and too small.  Therefore they are some what uncomfortable and leave marks my skin.  As they are $60 and non-returnable, I feel like I just have to deal with it now that I have them.  I would recommend going bigger if you are not sure what size to get and hopefully you won't have the same issue I have.Also, they say they are discreet, but there is nothing discreet about these and I would not use it in public in front of strangers.  This is understandable because they hold 8 oz each. It is nice that you can put them in your bra and pull down your shirt.Oh and customer service is fabulous! I called to make sure I could order just the cups and didn't need any of the accessories and I also had an issue with payment of their website.  They were very polite and helpful and informed me that I could buy them on amazon.  The best part is I didn't get sent to an automated message and the phone was answered really quickly.",1
"We love this chest rub... the smell stays a little longer than Baby vicks.. I used baby vicks on me once and yikes-  I felt itching on my neck.. hoping my little one didnt feel the same... he is 6 months so cant really talk :)Since we started daycare he has been congested a lot.. doesnt help its the first flu season either... this rub helps him noticably sleep better.. i rub it on his chest, back and soles of feet every night!! Helps open airways due to dry air too",1
I was going through bottles of baby soap so quickly and they aren't cheap.  This sponge creates a very nice lather and I use a fraction of the soap (1/10th) I was using before.  I have a very active baby and the quicker I can scrub him down and less stressful bath time is.  It's gentle and makes bath time a breeze.,1
I own almost every ocean wonders peice made.  My son liked most of these but the bouncer wasn't one he prefered.  I received two at my shower and he seemed to like the off brand one better.  He would stay in the ocean wonders bouncer up until he was 12 weeks but then I hadn't put him in for a while.  When he was almost 4 months I had to put him down so I could clean house and when I put him in it and turned on the noise he was scared of it.  Not to sure why but i'm glad i didnt spend the money on it.,0
"Love my new Itzy Ritzy snack bag! Perfect size, fun pattern, and I love that it's washable and reusable! I know I'm going to get a lot of use and save a lot of $ using these bags instead of throw away bags.  I highly recommend!",1
"Love the quality, the look and feel of the fabric.  Disappointed with the fact that most of the accent pieces are no longer available and or cost so much.",1
"My son and daughter-in-law requested this item and they are very pleased with it.  For their last child they used another brand, and  were dissatisfied.  However, they love the Diaper Champ.",1
"I bought this bedding set for my little guy because we were doing a surf theme for his nursery and I couldn't find anything else in surfing theme that we liked or that was available. It arrived and I was a little disappointed.  The quality is ok.  However now that I washed the blanket a couple of times, it has a tear in it so very disappointed about that.  The blanket is super thin so I usually add a blanket to the top over it so my little guy (now 19 months) doesn't get cold at night.  The bumpers are ok but the small ties look cheap and there are a ton of them.  The bed skirt only hangs properly when the crib mattress is at the tallest height, when you move the mattress down as your little one gets older, it now sits on the ground, which I really don't like because it looks messy all the time.  I constantly have to readjust and pull it around to make it look a little better.  Everything does wash up really nice in the washer, with exception of blanket though.",0
Great for my 10-months old boy. We got 2 sets and connected only 6 walls and 6 connectors. Enough room for toys and crawling.,1
Our backseat headrests don't raise so we had a hard time finding a mirror to work until this one. It fits great! Very adjustable. Love that you can hang toys from it. Good size. My son does pull it down from time to time but easy to put back up. Good quality & great to be able see what he's doing when turned backwards. You can see him perfectly in this mirror.,1
"My daughter is a HUGE fan of Sesame Street to start.  She has been interested in the potty for awhile, but here and there.  Since I got the Sesame Street toilet seat, well, we have to try to go potty all the time!  Love it.  Fits nicely and securely.",1
"The lid doesn't fit into the cup! Became a joke as everyone who came into our home would try, finally we have just resigned ourselves to using the cup lid less for training for regular cup but it wasn't what we needed",0
"Love this cup. Nothing spills out, no matter how much the cup is turned over and shaken! And, the ""straw"" part is very sturdy. My son has bitten off all other straws from several previous cups, but so far this one has been able to withstand his gnawing and gnashing. I also love that there are measurement marks on the side in both ounces and mL, and the flip lid stays on firmly (unlike our broken Thermos Foogo). Price is attractive, too. There are only two negatives: because nothing spills or leaks, it also takes some effort to drink juice. However, my toddler does just fine drinking from it. The cup is supposed to adjust to your child's sucking power at any age. Secondly, when we first opened this, my toddler called it a ""baby"" cup. Okay, so we're not thrilled with its aesthetics, but that is a minor trade off. I would buy this again and again.",1
"These make excellent, everyday burp cloths!  I highly recommend them!!  They're lightweight and fit easily into the smallest of diaper bags.  Considering their cost, I wouldn't be heartbroken if I happened to lose one along the way.",1
We are not really pleased with this product.  It is not quick to use and it does not feel secure no matter how tight you have it.I didn't return is because she said she &#34;might learn to like it&#34;  although we got gifted a front carry seat that she has used sense.It makes you feel close to your baby but not safe and secure.  ( that is just our opinion ),0
"This is the 2nd crib mattress we have bought from LA Baby, but something happened between the first and 2nd times.  This time, we had to set this one outside to let some weird smell evaporate.  Not sure what it was, but we definitely didn't like it at first.It's great now that the smell is gone.",0
I really like this stroller.  I can have my 3 month old in her car seat and my 2 1/2 year old standing on it or sitting on it while I'm taking walks around our neighborhood or if we go to the zoo.,1
"THIS BABY BJORN CARRIER IS VERY COMFORTABLE &amp; EASY TO GET THE MY 2 MONTH OLD IN AND OUT OF. I KNOW HE'S SAFE WHILE I'M WEARING HIM &amp; HE'S HAPPIER CAUSE HE'S RIGHT UP AGAINST ME,WHICH KEEPS HIM FROM BEING FUSSY WHILE SHOPPING. I REALLY LIKE THAT IT'S HANDS FREE &amp; EASY TO ADJUST. THIS IS A CLASSY LOOKING BABY CARRIER.",1
We have had this gate up for 8 months to keep the animals out of our new living room & it works great.  I love that it can easily be taken down if needed to clean or have more space to get through entry way.  I am going to order another one for our office.  It has held up great & we get compliments on how nice it is & blends in instead of looking like a gate.  Have had several people ask where we purchased it.,1
"this is a good beaker except for that the spout could be a bit bigger. my ten month old has problems trying to latch on to it. other than this the product is sturdy, colorful and leak proof.",1
This has been a seat saver for sure. My daughter is very small so even now at 2 1/2 she's just meeting the weight limit of 22lbs to forward face. So this has saved my seats from dirty feet. I would definitely buy again.,1
It's good product! It is working properly.  My wife love this product.  She carries this when ever she goes.  Thank you,1
"I first bought Cold Seat in 2008, two of them actually. It was a 5-star product back then. I wore out the first two and bought two new ones a few weeks ago. I almost bought myself one too, because they were so great for my kids, but I'm glad I didn't spend the extra $60 to get one for me. They have been made smaller, in both fabric coverage and ice capacity, and they are almost worthless now. My 2008 models kept my kids car seats very comfortably cold for a good 5-6 hours during the hottest Florida days in August, and even after 6 hours, their seats at least weren't as hot as they would have been without the Cold Seat. With the new, smaller one, I'm lucky to get 3-4 hours out of it, and the car seat doesn't get quite as cold, and it's only June. But don't worry, they still charge the same price for the ""new and improved"" one. It's a piece of junk, and at $60 plus shipping, it's a rip-off.",0
"Bought for our 22 month old when he moved to a toddler bed, he has been obsessed with the muslin swaddle blankets since birth so he loves that this feels the same as his blankies. Perfect weight and size to keep him warm.",1
"So glad Amazon has this for sale! I couldn't find replacements anywhere! These get gross, eaten up by the garbage disposal, or just plain vanish. New cups are expensive, so glad that these are offered. Playtex cups are THE BEST when it comes to preventing leaks.",1
I think the shape of the hole could be different. No other complaints with this product ... better than the little tubberware bowl I was using before :),1
I'm from China.I like it .It looks very good .It will fit for a warm season.I like it very much.,1
"My 4 month old has started grasping and playing with toys.  These rings are perfect for her little hands.  I love that they have different textures to offer her different sensory input on both her hands and in her mouth, she loves gumming them!",1
"As I read in the other reviews, the colors are not as bright as pictured.  However it is still very pretty.  I hung it on the wall by my front door- It's the first thing you see walking in.  It is very pretty.",1
"As soon as I saw this bedding online, I knew I had to have it for our baby girl!  It's absolutely gorgeous and looks just perfect in her room!Unfortunately, it's very delicate and even after washing it on delicate cycle just once, a little bit of the stitching began to come apart.The quilt isn't the softest and neither is the sheet, but I plan on using a super soft Cocalo Daniella blanket that I bought instead and letting the quilt be more of a decoration.I would most certainly buy this again, it's too beautiful not to!",1
This is a great product and extended the time that we were able to have our monitor off the base by hours.,1
"This cover is a great product. It fits all sizes nicely, is a great adjustable cover, looks very cute over your inserts; I overall think this is one of the best covers I owned. I liked it better than a lot of the expensive brand name covers.",1
I bought this after my analog became static  this is the best monitor  no static or noises and i love the talk back feature...i would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality baby monitor,1
My kids love these paci's...only wish the colored ones came with the vanilla scent and not just the green ones.,1
"Nice little pump.  With my first child i boug the I bought Medela Pump n Style (the expensive one that comes apart from the bag almost $300). I bought that pump because I thought I would only need to buy one pump ever. If I though it would have broken I don't think I would have paid so much for a pump. With that said this is not a review of the Medela pump, but I though it would help for you to have a quick comparison of the two pumps.The Medela pump cost me over twice as much as this pump and I had about $100 worth of parts. When it broke I did not want to spend another $300 for a new pump knowing that I only had about 6 months of pumping left. I am not planning to have another kid, but I would have no expectation that the pump would work for more than the one year warranty and they won't fix the pump if it breaks after one year. For the same price as this pump I tried the Medela single swing pump (I had the parts and wanted to stay with the same brand). It was the most frustrating experience! One person ate Medela was very helpful, but the other people I spoke with were very condescending. My problem with the swing pump was that it would consistently suck milk into the tubing and then into the pump. I had two pumps in two weeks and returned them with the desire never to see them again. I then was on the hunt for a different pump. I found this one. Here are the pros and cons for the pump n' style:Pros:1. It starts with a fast pump and then automatically changes to a longer pump to pull more milk2. The bag is pretty3. It was the brand that I rented at the hospital so all of the parts worked with it4. The pump suction was strongCons:1. It cost around $3002. It broke after a year and a half of use3. Customer service was not good!!! (except for one person who was nice)4. It comes with a ton of extras that I did not want/use (ie the big bag, it was cumbersome, everyone knew what it was, I just didn't like it. I would use a backpack instead)5. Condensation and milk would get into the tubing and was a pain to get out6. Did I mention that it did not work for two kids?The Ameda pump. I have been impressed and surprised by how much I have liked this pump. I kind of wish I had bought this one to begin with. Even if this pump had broken after my first kid I would still be up around $150 + the price of spare parts that I bought.Here are the pros and cons.Pros:1. Good price2. No milk or condensation gets into the tubing3. It is light weight4. You don't have to pay extra for stuff you don't want (ie the fancy bag)5. It has good suction6. I is comfortable7. It worksCons:1. It does not automatically switch from the fast to slow pump rate, but you can do it manually2. It is slightly louder than the Medela (not a big enough difference for me to consider going back to Medela)3. I have to buy new parts if I want to have spare parts (I had a big stash of Medela parts)4. It is not as pretty as the Medela (stretching for cons)Overall this is a nice little pump. It has taken a little getting used to and it is not as fancy as the Medela pump, but I have to be honest, knowing what I know now if I could go back in time I totally would have bought this pump over the Medela. The cost difference is huge and the functioning of the Medela is not significantly better.",1
"I bought this product in 2010, and it matched the Little Boutiques Safari line at Babies R Us perfectly!  Love it!",1
"Met all our needs and expectations and will be used for many family trips for years to come! Thanks, Regalo!",1
I thought a lot before writing my review about this blanket. it is totally a waste of money. it might be suitable for a small chiwawa. Not for a baby at all. Very thin and very very small. If i have a baby girl who has a Barby doll. it might be useful for her.Do not waste your money like me. Buy something worthy.,0
"We needed a cup holder for our Phil and Teds Explorer, this fits the handle bars great, hold its shape, unlike the version made for our brand of stroller. Overall very satisfied. Read previous reviews and I am just as happy as all the others!",1
nice Bib and quality item. will look great on my baby boy! nice nice nice highly recommended if you want little batman flying around your house!,1
She said it does help her sleep better and would recommend it for women who are pregnant and having trouble sleeping.,1
"I hate this monitor for many reasons and, in addition to those reasons, it stopped working completely after about 10 months.",0
"Took awhile to install/assemble the first gates because the instructions are inaccurate, but once we got that one figured out, the rest went in very quickly.  They seem very sturdy & give me great piece of mind.",1
The seat covers are great when using public restrooms!! They are oversized which is awesome since I'm potty training my daughter and she needs to hold the side of the seat. Only complaint is that the when you use the tape it stays on the seat. Would be nice if the covers were flushable.,1
This is nice because it makes noise but not at irritaing noice like some baby toys. I would recomend this toy,1
"The size is perfect. My daughter is super long and gaining weight rapidly so the changing table on the PnP is starting to buckle a little under her and this worries me. I bought a 2nd hand changing table that is just a LITTLE too big for the pad as the pad moves around a little, but the the strap that comes with the pad buckles around the top pf the table and secures it well to keep from moving. My daughter seems comfortable enough.",1
These are very easy to use baby food containers. The containers are thin but still serve the purpose. The silicone bottom help popping food out easily. I also bought and love the 1 ounce containers.,1
"I really like this book. You can show your baby shapes, teach her how to use buttons, zipper and snaps, tie a shoe and tell time. My baby is too young for most of these activities at this time, but she already loves to play with this book. I see a lot of quality time spent with this book in the future.",1
Very stylish and chic.  Love this cover even though nursing did not work out for me.  I wish it would've so I could keep wearing it!,1
"They look a lot cuter in the picture than in person. I was very suprised to find that these are pretty dull toys, which is very strage coming from Sassy. I usually love their toys but I was not impressed with these.They are very soft which is good for my little.",0
Bought my daughter a Kushie and a tuga.  The Kushie fits sooooo much better because my princess has chubby legs. The Kushie is soft and super easy to put on/take off due to the diaper design. It's soooo cute that I have her wear it as bathing suit bottoms. Love this product!,1
Its so easy to clean and the top layer is pretty soft with the laminationCompact and portable as advertised,1
"My husband got me this pillow for Valentine's Day, when I was about 20 weeks pregnant.  It was the best present ever!  We coined it the ""cloud pillow"" because it was so comfy.  I was so sad after I had my daughter and didn't have a legitimate reason to use it.  Now my husband on the other hand....I think he regretted getting me it.  It's pretty large and took up a lot of space in bed (we only have a queen) and didn't allow us to cuddle like we use to. Regardless, *I* think it was worth every penny!!",1
We received this item a few weeks ago and we are so happy with it! The product can be used for many things. We use for wet bibs (teething baby) and also to hold baby dirty spoons and bottles so our diaper bag doesn't get soiled. Once I can ditch the bigger diaper bag I plan on using this to hold the essentials.,1
"I had high hopes for this bag when I ordered it. It arrived yesterday, and I liked the overall look of the bag and the fact that it came with stroller straps. It was a little smaller than I was expecting, but even that would have been ok. I will be returning this bag because it has one major design flaw, and that is the fact that it does not zip completely across the top of the bag. When zipped, you end up with a hole on either side of the top of the bag where smaller items could easily fall out of the bag if it were to ever tip over (or get jostled/tossed around in the car).",0
"This arrived when expected, as described.  It is really cute, but won't be able to say how the baby likes it since the baby won't be here until Jan.",1
"I love the playnest!  My daughter has hip problems and we could not put her in an exersaucer type activity center.  This playnest was exactly what we needed!  It's perfect for babies who aren't sitting up completely on their own but who are ready to move past lying on their back on a play mat.  I can set her in it and she literally just hangs out, happy as a clam and I don't worry about her tipping over and bonking her head.  Within a week it improved her 'sitting skills'.  I don't understand what the other reviewer found hard about the assembly of this product.  There are two pieces; the inner tube and the cover.  You slide the empty inner tube into the cover and then you blow it up.  Couldn't be easier.",1
"I love this drying rack!  My wife always hated having a traditional drying rack sitting on the counter for more than 5 minutes, but she loves how this one looks!  Get the accessory flower or butterfly too, they are great!",1
"This gadget is just great for new or even experienced moms.  Keeps track of when you changed, fed, pumped last, how long the baby has been sleeping.....all with the touch of a button and no bigger than a cell phone.  I recommend this item strongly.",1
"they came as promised, but they were kind of cheap feeling. the material wasn't as soft as i hoped for. we wound up not even using them, so i cannot say if they would have gotten better after a couple of washes. we decided to go with flannel sheets for her crib instead.",0
This product is apt for 3-6 months old. It would have been nice if the over head bar was more sturdy.,1
"I wasn't sure what to expect after reading many reviews for this changing table, but I wanted to love it because the storage baskets (especially the hamper) are perfect for storing my clean cloth diapers.  I just take them out of the laundry, throw them right into the hamper, and grab one out when I need it.  It doesn't get any easier than that.  The assembly could not have been easier and I never assemble furniture.  Maybe the people who wrote otherwise got defective products.  I would recommend and different changing pad as the one it comes with is pretty cheap, but it would definitely do the job.  I am extremely happy with this purchase!",1
"I love this gate for how it looks and works. The open/close function takes some getting used to, but it definitely works to keep our son away from sump pumps and litter boxes! (Wish it had a cat hole!)  We like the white bar along the floor because we have a small step up where it is installed and this reminds people to step over.",1
"I really wanted to love these caps and they are good for storing premade formula without wasting a nipple and cap. However, I found that the caps can leak if the bottles get tipped over in a diaper bag or the like. I imagine you could screw them tight enough to prevent this, but at that point I would have trouble getting the cap back off. I would have given this 5 stars if it had a washer in the cap to prevent leaks but I imagine they would have cost more. That being said, they are wonderful for storage in your fridge or other place where you know they won't tip over.",1
"it never worked, when i got the item it wouldnt heat up. was a deffective item and found out was no longer sold.",0
"I bought this product in order to help in potty training my 2yr-old, while out and about. However, I found it to be inadequate for the task. First of all, the toilet seat is about half the size of a public toilet set. (The advertisement claims that it can fit elongated toilet seats. Not true! It doesn't even fit my standard sized toilets.) Secondly, there are no fasteners or clips to stabalize the toilet cushoin and keep it from moving around (another false promise). And lastly, there is no locking mechanism to keep the toilet cushion from foldin into itself, while my little one is sitting on it. Therefore, my LO felt uneasy while sitting on it and refused to go (and I can't blame her). This product is bordering false advertisement as it does not have the features that it claimed to have in its advertisement. I am thoroughly disappointed. And I will be throwing it in the trash.",0
"Should have listened to others reviews. My 15 month old is crazy about Bubble Guppies and loves to stack things together, so I thought this was prefect. The cups do not stay together at all. Cute idea but poorly made, so glad I didn't spend more money than I did.",0
My son started chewing his clothes in Kindergarten.This is one great way to satisfy the chewing.  I clip one of these to his coats and the clothes chewing problem is solved.If you have a chewer--- I'd recommend these.,1
in my experience the scald safe seems to say the water is too hot when its just right. i have had several people check my sons bath water at what to me feels perfect and they have all said it feels right. he appears comfortable and happy. yet the scald safe tells me his water is far too hot and turns bright pink. i was excited to have found something that i had found so fool proof but really all it helps with is knowing weather or not his water is too cold instead.,0
"My son accepted this cup on the first try.PROS:  'tilty' design makes it easier for child to drain cup, easy to clean, no valveCONS:  no volume markings (i.e. ounces), no cap (making them less than ideal for travel), not leak proof4 stars for me because unlike many parents this is the only cup I had to try.",1
"my son has cystic fibrosis, so he eats a lot.  he can suck down 11 oz easy with these.  remember to always use the adapter ring thing, super easy, lids work great, it doesnt spill milk within the lid, its perfect height to close the nipple hole while u travel.  we had the tommy tippee, and also the playtex, and these.  we eventually went to all avent.  tommee tippee the nipple is so wide, it would collapse on itself often.  the playtex had too many parts, and hard to keep track, we have a crowded enough kitchen cabinets as it is.  avent rules, and yes it makes him swallow less air, so less burping.  still burp the baby though lol.  until he is like 1 yrs old.  and remember dont put ur baby to sleep with his bottle.",1
I ordered these to start feeding my five month old solids. I must say they are perfect. Our baby loves being fed with these. They are simple enough and yet don't hurt baby's delicate gums or mouth. They work well and are better than I expected.,1
Loved this cover my kid loves getting in her Elmo seat. She screams Elmo every single time and hops in.,1
I got this after I thought the potty seats on the floor were too low and he sees us and the other kids at daycare sitting on the big potty so it has helped with getting him to get used to the big potty.,1
"I was a little hesitant about this as my daughter who is two and a half is not very adventerous, but a friend recommended trying this seat, so I went ahead and tried it.  It is so easy to install and easy to use, best of all my daughter loves it!!!  It is so nice having her right there and being able to get around so easily with her on it.  Just the other day we were at a parade and she needed the bathroom, the only bathroom was a mile away and bam on the toter and we were there in a snap, the toter saved the day!!!  She can honeslty be on it for hours at a time without getting bored.  My wife and Mother in Law's first question was where is the seat belt, but honestly after they tried it they realized that the child is right there between your arms and legs there is no concern there anymore.This product is definately worth the price as it provides for years of fun.  The construction is very solid, and if anything were to happen the replacement parts are not expensive.I definately recommend this to anyone with toddlers who enjoys family bike rides.",1
"My local BRU had only 15 strollers to look at and most of them were umbrella or AIO travel systems. I still liked the BJ City Mini due to its low weight and easy fold but it lacked the options I wanted and the growth potential for a second kid.  I also really liked the JJ Cole Broadway but again- no second seat. So I traveled a ways to visit BBB and boy was that overwhelming but fun. They had tons of strollers, including many great convertible strollers that go from 1-2 kid configurations but most of them were tandem and not side to side. The issue with tandem strollers such as the Baby Jogger City Mini and the Britax was that although it had lots of optional configurations, they really didn't work for two kids. I didn't see either of them being comfortable in recline and it was just cumbersome to get them in and out.  So off to side-by-side. Near the end of our visit we discovered the Bugaboo Donkey and boy was that a delight to test drive. With its side bag and colorful shades and cool features, it was definitely becoming my favorite. The only problem was the price! It was WAY too expensive.Anyhow, we went back to searching online and watching tons of youtube videos. I got rid of my hope that one stroller would do everything, but this one comes close. I put together a list of must haves and then optional items with priority. Some of the things I love about this stroller is that it fits through doors with ease, has the full recline for infants, you can jog with this (confirmed directly with MB), the handle adjusts for my tall hubby, the mom-facing, free-standing, carry-cot bassinet option for 0-6mo, the side Joey Bag (Bugaboo style), easy gliding, great storage underneath (although hard to reach if kid is in full-recline) and the easy locking foot bar. We were quite nervous that the handle would not provide enough distance from the stroller for my 6'4 husband but it does. He has a long stride and has no issue with this.  Also the side-by-side feature really was important. You can easily tend to each kid and adjust canopies, or cover them independently and its easy to get them in and out. Plus they cannot kick or grab each other.  I really think this would work well in a lot of different places- amusement parks, malls, church, outdoors, neighborhood walks and jogs. I love that I can have take the freestanding bassinet into restaurants, church pews and also make a downstairs bed.Some Negatives:The tires came a bit flat so we will have to air them up. Pump is not included. Also he noticed that the silver was easily scratched, despite his care in assembling it.  I do have some concern on the width of the seats as they really are narrow but I really do not plan on pushing around 5 year olds in this, so I'm okay with that.  There is no real handlebar drink storage which would be great to have.  The recline is easy enough to adjust but you do have to kneel down and it takes both hands. The canopy is kind of a wobbly fit and I kind of wish it was bigger and provided more wind resistance as there are gaps on the side. And when you adjust the recline the extra fabric bunches up near the kid's head. (Not a huge issue, but a lil annoying). It also has a velcro window on top- but any craft gal can easily add some magnet closure if this really was important to her.  Also- how great would it be if they had the optional canopy covers in those jewel tones like JJ Cole?My most helpful tip I can give is to keep and update a list of your wish list items and must haves when doing looking. After buying this without ever test driving it in person- I love it! I am so glad I took the plunge and went with it.",1
"This is such a simple thing, but it has been so useful while traveling with two kids and their two carseats.",1
"I bought this brush for tall beer glasses and shaker bottles. It's living up to the gross foamy challenge. The old days of squirting some soap into a glass, turning on the water totally hot and strong, followed by just hoping that would clean it are over.  Thank you OXO. I'm still not sure what nipple I'm supposed to clean with this.",1
"Love these crib liners.  It did take a little adjusting to fit our mini cribs, but then they did fit perfectly.  They are nice and soft.  I am much more comfortable with them sleeping in their mini cribs with breathable mesh liners.",1
I love that I can leave this on all night. We take it with us everywhere and my daughter loves it!,1
It lets me store and frizz baby food with no problems. Easy to store and use. I wish it came with different colors,1
It was a baby shower gift. She registered for it and loved it. Very useful and attractive item..Dads can use it too.,1
"Love at first sight.  My 4-month-old grandaughter dived in with delighted play.  The texture of the pages, the cracklel-sound they make when handled, the teething edges all kept her enthralled.  They really hit all the high points on this one.  She was so enthralled that she didn't want to stop playing when she was hungry; we had to feed her while she continued to play.Highly recommend!",1
"At first I was registered for one of the 4 in 1, transformer bathtubs until a friend pointed me to a few negative reviews I hadn't read. The one about the baby boy's private parts getting pinched and STUCK, requiring medical attention, scared me in to finding a bath that didn't have any seams or grooves or moving pinchable parts.This bath is large and doesn't fold at all, but I loved it nonetheless. I gave up the bottom portion of a hallway closet for storage, removing a shelf, and it was totally worth it. It's useful for infants who can't sit up unsupported if you use the reclining direction. Then when they're older, you put them in facing the other way and they can safely and comfortably sit up without slipping or tipping. I think its size contributes to its sturdiness and safety.Our first HATED baths of any kind for almost the first year, but even so, this bath kept her safe and supported so it made the not-so-fun task of giving a bath a little more tolerable.We loaned it out to a friend in between kids and now have it back only we're missing one of the tubes for the drain. I was going to just go to the hardware store and rig something up, but instead called the company today (PrimoBaby) and they're sending me one out, free of charge. Can you even believe it? Who (other than Medela) has customer service that good nowadays? I know it's a cheap part that probably costs them 5 cents, but it'll cost me more than that in gas for me to drive the 1/2 mile to the store to find something similar that may or may not work.In conclusion: Yes, it's large, but other than that, I have zero complaints which is more than I can say for just about any other product I currently own.",1
It is a very nice and big bib--and easy to wash.  The pouch catches all the food my hungry grandson drops.,1
"I bought this for my son when he was about a month old and he did not have much interest in this at all until he was almost 3 months. Now that he's 7 months old, this is his must have toy to be around. He plays with it on the change table, his swing, in the car seat, in the stroller and even on his floor mat. I don't know what it is, but he loves to chew on it and just swing it around crazily. The toy is very well made and the colors are nice. It's easy to clean, just use soapy water, rinse, air dry and it's ready for him the next day.",1
Looks nice.  Adjustable.  It's held up and you can easily open and close the gate.  I just ordered my second one.,1
Nice firm padding for furniture edges and corners to protect our 2 year old and with plenty of 3M adhesive tape.  BTW it may not seem like a big deal but the adhesive by 3M makes a difference.  Other adhesive tapes don't stick as well and are easily pulled off by our toddler.,1
This did not fit my 18x36 cradle mattress.  It makes it fold in the middle if I try to fit it on.,0
Received item and colors are perfect. I can not wait to see our new addition to the family in it.,1
Works like a charm to me! Wish I had bought this earlier when my baby starts solids.just don't put hot food in it to avoid the concerns of the plastics.,1
I bought this for my niece's baby girl to come and they have been playing with it while they wait for her arival- they love it!,1
"Great quality, so soft, she loves it so does  our daddy :-)worth the money for sure. Does not have any smell to it. Good product.",1
"My daughter started using these cups at about 15 months old and loves them. They were the first hard-spout sippy cup that I could get her to drink from. It's true that at first they are hard to get anything through, you just have to gently poke a toothpick or something similar through the spout to separate the slit. After doing this, all 6 of our worked perfectly. My daughter is still using them at 22 months of age. That's 7 months of daily use and daily washing (top rack dishwasher) and they still don't leak. We haven't replaced a single one.",1
"I spent a lot of time looking for a diaper backpack before my 2nd child was born.  I really liked the zip out diaper changing compartment and front organizational pocket.  It's large enough that I don't have to carry a purse.  Now that I've been using it I LOVE the fact that it can attach to a stroller or shopping cart with ease.  But after only a few uses the mesh cup/bottle holders have torn.  There was also a loose string coming off the backpack when it arrived that caused a """"run"""" immediately.  For the price I wasn't happy.  Despite these two issues I still like and use the bag.",1
"My baby is only 10 weeks and starting to teeth and most common teething rings and toys are too big an thick for his mouth and he gets very frustrated! This is smaller and fits his hand perfect, it's bendy and softer than the usual teether and seems very durable! He's just leaning hand to mouth with this new toy and seems to be very happy with it. Not to mention it is the funniest thing in the world to see a tiny baby with a rib in his mouth! We LOVE this!",1
"I paid the appropriate value for this order of TWO sets of three-pack bibs: a girl color collection and a Keith Haring collection(total of 6 bibs). I received ONE set of girl color bibs. Despite contacting the seller multiple times, I have never received a response, the other half of my order, a refund or a credit. NOTHING. The Bumkins SuperBibs are GREAT. This seller is EXTREMELY irresponsible. Buy these bibs from someone else or you are paying double the value for three bibs.Message to seller: If for some reason this review sparks a response the only thing I want now is a credit for 50% of my order. I got more bibs from someone else.",0
"I bought two of these a year ago and my granddaughters, now both a year old, have found them endlessly entertaining.  These are a good value for the price.",1
The book is colorful and is perfect for 6months and older. The only thing I didn't like was the strong smell of the dyes and/or material. I dunked the pages in detergent. Then let the book dry overnight.,1
"Definitely will buy again in the future from this seller, good original product, good price, and fast delivery.The price shown is far cheaper than the exhibition price, and it's really worthed to buy,especially when the things can be shipped to Singapore!Thanks a lot!",1
"I loved my Medela breat pump and highly recommend it to people.  It's a wonderful investment as I was able to breastfeed for 6 months... You know, Enfamil and Similac are NOT cheap... A simple secret -- I purchased a completely new one from EBAY and was soooo much cheaper than buying at Babies R Us.",1
I love this cup.  I love the handle.  I love that the lid screws on.  I love how well its held up after washing it every night it in the dishwasher.  It's his favorite to get the snacks out of.  It also leaves the least mess! :0),1
"Great seat, solid foundation and connection support.  Delivery was outstanding.  Ordered on Thursday and seats were at the house on Saturday.This is an exepensive seat.",1
"Best thing ever, best clip for any kind of soothed and they stay on anything you put them on, wether its cloths car seat ect,",1
Santa brought our 5 month old the Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo and it was a hit!  My husband and I both commented that we were looking forward to when our baby learned how to make the most of the jumperoo.  To our amazement he knew instantly and has been jumping ever since.  He is currently a bit too short but we simply placed something underneath him until his toes touch the floor.  We have purchsed a lot for the little guy and this is by far the best so far!,1
"It is very colorful, and looks great.  But it just makes a noise for the four different buttons they push.  It doesn't keep my 16-month old grandson's interest for over ten seconds - he's not interested at all.  I paid a lot less for it, and wouldn't pay more than $10-$15 for it.",0
"I bought this to bathe my infant grandson when he is visiting.  It holds him securely, but I would not move away from him, and dries fast.  When he is older I will use it in the tub for him to sit on. For now it is cosy and clean for sink baths. It is also small and inexpensive which counts for a grandma who already has a house that is beginning to look like babyland.",1
"I wish I knew of a place in the US that manufactured baby swings because I can not find a decent swing anywhere! This is the third baby swing we've tried and, once again, we were disappointed.  Here's why:Pros:1)  Plenty of songs - the music is gentle and you have a decent variety to choose from.  The volume control is done with a knob rather than a button which allows you to have better control over how loud or quiet you need the music to be.2)  Soft fabric - the seat does feel soft, even though some of it looks a little low grade compared to a blanket you'd probably rather give you child instead.3)  Removable seat - the swing chair comes off the arm which allows you to move the baby to new areas without having to move the entire machine (just don't move the seat around with the baby in it! Common sense parents.)  The seat however doesn't do anything on it's own so don't expect it to entertain.4) Contemporary colors - fits better with a family room or master bedroom where you're more likely going to have it anyway.Cons:1) Construction - like any other swing, this one is made using the same basic concepts of easy-to-use/easy-to-build.  That means less screws and less work for the parent assembling it.  That kind of thinking is what leads to disaster at some point.  My first swing had the drive device on the motor fail and the second swing could no longer turn the mobile. On THIS swing the connection point between the mobile arm and the motor broke apart when the two met, and the bolt on the swing leg was the wrong size so the bolt could not be screwed in.2) Swing power - Good swing power, but when the newborn needs to swing at a low setting it feels like medium.3) Price - $180. A little high for something used only for a few months don't you think?3) Fisher-Price - I wish they had better service, I really do, but when I found out the swing I just purchased was broken while assembling it I found out how much trouble it was to resolve the issue.  The company does not yet replace parts for this swing so they replace the entire swing instead.  Sounds good right? Well not really. The told me to send it back using the following instructions: ""You will need to pay the appropriate postage for your package when you take it to the post office.  It's important that you request and retain an insurance receipt for protection against loss during transit. Please return your Seat Back Tube & One Swing Base to us within 30 days.  Upon receipt of your returned package, a replacement product will be sent within four to six weeks.""  FOUR TO SIX WEEKS!! Wow Fisher-Price lost me there. Amazon got it to me relatively quickly but I haven't even used it yet and it looks like I won't get to for another month or two.OVERALL RATING: 3 out of 5.  Save yourself the trouble and go with something a little less expensive.  The swing is ok and I can't wait until my replacement comes back to me in 4-6 weeks *sigh* but if I could do it over again I would go with a simple swing and use the money to send my wife to a masseuse. She's going to have to carry our baby around in her arms for the next 4-6 weeks and she'll definitely need a massage after that...",0
"very nice and higher quality, though the bumpers didn't quite fit on my baby's crib so I didn't use them and the valances we a bit too much. I wish I was able to only buy the few pieces that can be used rather than buying a 9 piece set and only use 3 of the pieces.",0
We really believe these bottles have helped my wife continue to both breast feed and bottle feed our daughter with no &#34;nipple confusion&#34; or other issues.,1
"I bought these instead of Aden and Anais wraps because of the price difference. Don't be fooled. The size is great and they are cute but they DO NOT wash up soft and cozy like the A&A ones do. If you are looking for the cozy awaddle wrap, this isn't it.",0
"My husband and I are proud owners of a Sunshine Kids Radian 80SL.  This car-seat is perfect.  We had a booster for a long time for our 7 year old who out grew his old car-seat.  After lots of research and youtube videos, found that boosters offer no protection in a car crash.  Horrified, we started shopping immediately for a new car-seat.  We've had this Sunshine car-seat for almost two years and we are completely happy with it, and so is our son.  The memory foam isn't bulky, but very comfortable for long car rides.  Our son likes the mesh cover, as it breathes and he no longer gets sweaty under his legs and bum.  He's a messy eater, but we've never had a problem cleaning the fabric.  The crotch pad did fray a little, but it's still in great condition and we haven't had to replace or fuss with it much.  It is very heavy, but the carrying strap is very useful for short trips in changing cars.We chose it because at this time it's the only one with a steel frame, and rated for side, front and rear car crashes.  Also, Sunshine Kids Radian models are the only ones that have a weight limit up to 80lbs.  Britax is only to 65lbs in their top models.  Also, Britax is much more expensive than Sunshine Kids.We love it so much that we just ordered a new one today, same model and type, just a slightly different color (for no particular reason), because we're pregnant again with our second baby :)I've read some of the 1 and 2 star ratings and I'm not sure why some people are having a such a hard time getting them installed or getting the rear facing angle to work out properly.  Might be more of the car or suv seat itself that's angled a little odd and not the car-seat.  This model comes with an angle booster base that can be shifted to get the right angle for infants.  It only took my husband 5 minutes to install it by himself, I did the heavy looking on.This is an awesome car-seat and I wouldn't go with another brand ever again...this car-seat will protect your child and save their life if there's a car crash.  Peace of mind wins out!",1
"When our son was a newborn he had a really tough time with gas. We hated to see him in pain, so we tried everything. His doctor recommended putting warm wash cloths on his tummy while he lay on his back for a few minutes to let the bubbles come together and then burping him. We had some success with that, and when we saw this it looked like a similar treatment with a little less trouble.It works pretty well. It usually helped calm him down. As a veteran of the Tummy Wars I would suggest this or the warm wash clothes, combined with Baby's Bliss Gripe Water 4 oz. and Mylicon (it's safe to use both) and comfort from you.It does get better! Good luck!",1
"My son was excited to turn 4 and get a new booster seat. This seat rates the highest on Consumer Reports, so we looked online to find a cool design. I have never gone wrong ordering through Amazon. Timely, as expected and at a good price. This seat makes it so easy getting in and out and my son loves the cup holders for drinks and toys!",1
SIMPLY PUT:  I AM SO OBSESSED WITH THIS STROLLER.  IT IS A FANTASTIC BRAND AND EASY TO PUT TOGETHER.  VERY STURDY!,1
I like it a lot but I hate the fact it doesn't come with a mobile like the other pack and plays ! If there's anyway I can purchase it separately let me know so I can buy it asap ! Great product but it should have that extra part,0
im a dad and my 16 year old son loves to have sleep overs but somthimes he gets scared and i need to come sleep with him. so i got him this what is lees scary than the sith lord himself? nothing! he loves it now only if they made a bed warmer too! great buy a life saver!,1
"I have been washing and drying it (low heat) with no problems. It fits well. Just don't scrub really hard when you spot clean it, because I noticed a lot more &#34;wear and tear&#34; from that. Other than that, it's just what I was looking for.",1
"I was lucky enough to receive my Snooze Shade as a sample, after seeing a friend from the UK using hers.Before I had it, I was using pegs (!) to hold down a black pashmina in a desperate attempt to shield my 5 month old from the sun (even in the winter), and allow him to sleep in his stroller. The Snooze Shade changed everything. It's small enough to keep in the basket underneath my stroller (Bugaboo Bee), and I just whip it out when he's tired and we're about to start walking. It fits perfectly, and stays securely in place. It takes about one minute to put it on. He is ALWAYS asleep within minutes. I couldn't live without it now, and am so relieved I sorted the problem before summer!",1
"Right out of the box it wouldn't boot up.  The red light never changed to white as indicated in the manual.  Spent 30 mins on hold to get to support.  They said it was probably defective.  Returning it tomorrow.Also, while waiting on hold for support we went to download the app for the iPad... it's actually an iPhone app that stretches and also has atrocious reviews about hardly ever connecting.",0
It doesn't stick to the tub and is smaller than I would have liked. I wish I had returned it.,0
This Se Life Mobile is beautiful and wonderful for Bailey's Crib.Her parents loved it and put it on the crib immediately.Thanks,1
"The bear is not super fluffy or full, but that is the point! It's a thin bear so it's easy for the toddlers to lug around and sleep with. I bought this for my 9 month old niece for Christmas and it was the only thing she got that she really paid attention to. So glad I found this for her!",1
"My little one was 3months, not quite able to hold on to things yet, she was able to start learning to do so with this toy and is now shaking and kicking it around. lots of fun",1
"I was a little afraid to purchase this mattress for my daughter's Graco Pack n Play based on the dimensions, but after reading some reviews saying it would fit, I thought I would give it a try.  I am so happy I did!  I found one through Amazon's Warehouse Deals and got a great price!  It fits very well, there is virtually no gap, especially after adding a Carter's Quilted Velour Playard Sheet.  My daughter's naptime away from home now is so much more comfy!  I highly recommend!",1
No problems ...all good and on time.  Delivery was well arranged and the product exactly as advertised.  My granddaughter is sleeping well on it !,1
The book is just a few pages long with a few words to each page.  Just short enough to keep the attention of my 6 month old son.  We have the Elephant as well so when he's older it will be neat to see the realization of the association between the stuffed toy and the book character,1
"Wanted a digital caliper. They are pretty expensive in my country. This tool is worth every cent. Its accurate enough for an auto mechanic. The quality is good, and should last a lifetime, although the display housing is plastic. Super buy.",1
I got a few packs of these spoons. Very soft so easy for toddlers to carry food to their mouth. I like how it's deep enough that they can feed things that r more liquidy. Wish they have different color options.,1
"This saucer is definitely a great toy.  My 6 month old twins have enjoyed it since they were 4 months.  They love the sounds, sights, and music.  In fact, my son's first laugh came from the sounds of the spinners before he was big enough to even use it.  The one drawback is that they now want to bounce and it has no springs like the Evenflo ultrasaucer we own as well. It is sad when my son ""bounces""  but doesn't go anywhere.  It would be a 6 star if it only had springs.",1
"I purchased this for my 6-month old, who had gotten too long for the usual sleep sacks.  She would struggle to kick her feet around and get quite frustrated.  This definitely solves the problem.  It's also not so heavy that she gets sweaty inside, but seems to keep her warm.  I'm not sure I would have paid full price, but for half price I'm happy with this purchase.  Would be a cool shower gift, something a little bit different that could last for 2 years!",1
"I can't belive how well these stay on and how willing my 6-month old is to wear them!  They're really effective, and are somehow comfortable for babies as well.  They've made a huge difference this spring -- my son is pretty sensitive to bright sunshine and when he's wearing these, he's happy to stay outside all day.Because they dont velcro behind his head they're probably more likely to end up in his mouth than some other sunglasses, but for now they're working well.",1
"As much as I love (see other review) the Diono Radian RTX, I really feel that this piece should have come with it.  When you pay $300 for a car seat, you really shouldn't have to buy any accessories.",1
"I love this monitor! The picture and sound clarity is amazing. The screen is the perfect size...I like that its big enough that I can really see what's going on, but it's still portable, so I can carry it around the house with me. The extras are really what made me fall in love with this though. The lullabies feature is a life saver and I like being able to see the temperature in my sons room, as I am constantly worried whether he is warm enough. I have had 3 different monitors and this is hands down my favorite!",1
this product arrived on time. i also purchased the crib bedding Pink Safari which has brown not black stripes. this sheet has black and still worked well for an extra set of sheets to compliment the crib set,1
My 4 1/2 month old Grandson spends approximately 30 minutesin this jumper every day.  He feels so independent!  He is ableto turn it around and find Mommy!He'll be enjoying this jumper for a few more months.Instructions clearly show how high to adjust the jumperoff the floor so his little feet touch the floor just right.,1
"It thought this product would be great for my baby who started teething at 3 months, but she ended up dropping it out of her mouth a lot because she opened her mouth so wide to chew on it. Which just led to a lot of me picking this product off the floor. She did seem to like it when it was actually in her mouth though and it fit her gums much better then other teether a since she was so young when she started teething.",0
"I love my agility carrier. It is light weight, easy to use and fits perfectly in my diaper bag so I can take it with me when I am out and about.",1
"These are AMAZING stickers.  I put them in my grandkids room and they love to point and recite.  The colors are beautiful and the letters are large enough to talk about.  The animals are fun and the kids are always making animal noises.  Pricing is super affordable and they do come off easily if you need to reposition.  At the same time, they stick well!  Would recommend for any room...",1
This chair is perfect for ages 18months and up. My daughter uses it all the time. We did not put the plastic rocker pieces on yet because we don't think she is ready but she loves this chair. It is very stable and durable. It does get dirty easily and doesn't wipe clean. I use resolve to clean the chair and it takes out what ever she may have gotten on it.,1
"honestly, I would have loved that music was more cheerful. A light touch will not fall ill. But, it's good",0
"I wish I would have tried this out before buying. I initially bought a beautiful Pottery Barn rocker that I had recovered to match my nursery. It is beautiful, but not the most most practical or comfortable for rocking my baby to sleep. I only realized that after trying out my mom's glider that she purchased off of craigslist.  It was the most comfortable glider/rocker experience and my baby fell fast asleep loving it.  (I'm not sure of brand). I mistakenly assumed that all gliders would be the same and purchased the Stork Craft from Amazon the same day. You get what you pay for. I find this glider stiff, the ottoman squeaks (which my husband has yet to fix) and the seat is just overall mediocre.  I am hoping my mom will trade me since she only uses hers when her youngest of grandchildren (mine) comes for a visit",0
"I had a chance to review The Juppy on my blog, and I just loved it! It was so easy to use, kept the baby upright, walking, and secure and didnt cause us any back pain! It's really a must have! You can read my full review and enter to win a Juppy (until 12/12/10) on my blog, [...] We give it 5 stars!",1
We got these for our daughter who says they are absolutely worth their weight in gold. Anything that makes traveling in a car-seat  more enjoyable must be a good thing.,1
"So great! Looks amazing, and super easy to build. I have it in my living room and it has made all the difference storage and design wise. It looks very chic and stylish. Very happy.",1
"These stickers took a really long time to arrive and once they did, they are TINY (like the size of a dime). They are going straight to the trashcan.",0
"1 StarsI will be returning this car seat back to Target today. Bought it about a week ago and it just does not secure too well in my 99 Lexus GS300. This booster seat consistently slides over to the right when secured in the center of the back seat.While driving I found myself consistently pulling over to readjust the seat with my  3 year old daughter in it who is at best 35 pounds. And Yes, I am using a lap and shoulder belt system exactly the way the instructions say to position them.Safety is the most important thing with me when it comes to booster seats, and this one is surely to have my daughter not secured if an accident occurs since it barely has her secured during normal driving conditions and simple turns.",0
I am not even sure this is safe for kids to sleep in. It is like putting them in a snow suite and putting them to bed. We have had a  horrible time with our son getting him to sleep and one blurry eyed morning I decided to order this. I had high hopes that it would help but it just didn't. First he is able to pull his legs up onto his body so he gets stuck in like a egg position and this wakes him up. Secondly I put him in this in a onesie and keep his room cool and he is still covered in sweat when he wakes up. It is just way to thick. I was really hoping this would help us all sleep but it just didn't.,0
This was much smaller and not at all what was described.  The product is hard and not desirable for what it was designed for.  We did receive it promptly though.,0
"I use this carrier for my son he is now almost 3 months. He likes to carry him in this carrier than stroller :) we started to use this one when he is 1 months old, the head support is great to support his head, now he can support his neck by himself, we removed the head support.",1
"My daughter prefers this bottle to the other.  Also, and the wide mouth makes it easy to clean- no bottle brush needed!",1
They're fine if you want to change them out every hour.  I'm a working mom and I over-produce and leak more than other women. These leaked through so quickly.  I much prefer Nuk reusable nursing pads.,0
"Very disappointed! This was a baby shower gift and never arrived. netStocker is the reason for 1 star, not the product. I am not reviewing the product because I have no idea what it is like. I do not recomment netStocker.",0
"I didn't think I'd like this cover. With my first child over 6 years ago, I had a cover that was more like a pancho style and covered me 360 degrees.  It had a loop to help open it.  I was looking for something like this again, but couldn't find t.I decided to give this a try.  It's so much better than I thought it would be.  It's super light weight, so baby never gets over-heated. If anything, it gives nice cool shade. The wired neckline is rigid enough to stay open but not too rigid that the whole thing can't role up into my very compact diaper bag, and the opening made by the wire neckline is wide enough to give mom a full access view, but somehow angles perfectly so no one else can see.My only complaint is that sometimes my sides show, so if I have an up-pulled shirt, I'm showing skin. It is wider, though than it looks on the picture so it covers a lot.  It has tiny little weights at the bottom to keep it from blowing up in the wind.I also thought I'd hate the print/design.  My old cover was a low-key black cover as not to announce visually that I was nursing. But this pattern is so pretty in person that it looks like a nice blouse. So far I've used it daily and I can say that at least once a day someone says ""Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know you were nursing under there!""I'm very pleased and just bought one for my sister who has an infant as well.  The one flaw I have with it not being 360 degrees is overshadowed by all the benefits. I even think it might not work so well, may be a bit cumbersome to maneuver in, if it were a full-around design.",1
"My 3 month old daughter LOVES this toy. The bright colors on the front, the black and white contrast on the back, and the crinkly sound it makes all fascinate her.",1
"I tried the disposable pads and they would get all bunched up and misshapen when I'd pull the bra down to nurse. These keep their shape and feel much more pleasant against the skin. I got 2 packs and that was more than enough to last until the next load of baby laundry. Plus, I feel like I'm not putting more plastic, etc. in a landfill, which is always a concern to me being a new mom!",1
U lose one u have another on hand sometimes its necessary to change an old one with a new if you own these bottles I recommend having these on hand.,1
"Very clear - connects all the way from basement up to the room I'm monitoring - and this is an old house w thick walls.  I love how clear it sounds, no static.  I also like being able to ask the kids if they are ok.  I can hear them clearly.",1
"Picture is clear but can be better (compared to iphone 4).  The ""talk"" function and night view capability should be a standard on all other video type monitors.Sometimes the connectivity cuts off (couple of seconds or so)---possibly due to wifi N signal interruption around the house, not sure.Anyway, if you are looking to get a video baby monitor, get this one: simple and easy to use with two way communication.  BTW, it doesn't use lithium battery (it uses NiMH, initial charge require 16 hours per instruction manual and last up to 4 hours; will work without battery when on charging cradle) and only support one camera.Note:Static video only, no zoom capability",1
"I just threw this tub away after using it 3 times.  It does not fit securely over the sink, wobbling precariously and sometimes falling.  Dos NOT fit into sink as pictured here.  The sling is very narrow so that even a baby who cannot roll over is prone to falling off.  Also covers the majority of the sink so that you cannot run water outside the tub into the sink (that part you CAN see in the picture here).Spend a little more and don't risk endangering your baby!",0
"I have the older model pump in style.  I looked up which tubes to buy for my pump, and I read that I needed the #8007214 tubes, the ones I am writing this review for.  The tubes have yellow tips on both ends (just like in the picture:).  The tubes that fit my pump just have the plastic tube on the end that connects to the pump, no yellow tip.  I just cut the yellow tips off of the tubes, and it seems to be working fine.",1
"Perfect fit for all our diaper bags (petunia pickle bottom, Vera Bradley, Diaper dude)",1
"Really cute,everyone love this car seat cover,hat is really cute too...I loved.Is a lot more easy just put my baby in zipper and go.",1
"got this as a present for the new mama, and she loves this, knows when the baby cries and needs to go into the room to check on her.  also they got a second camera to watch the kids play room, so everyone is getting the watch treatment. and it's a great way, to be away and know what the kids are talking about.",1
The boyfriend and I purchased this Product due to our Newborn is a consent eater due to Reflux and this bottle warmer is a life saver. It was hard to figure out how much water at first because you can't completely go by what they recommend. We use the Playtex Drop-in Nurser bottles and it works GREAT! only took us 2 tries to get the water level right. It is even more of a life saver at night when we are half awake and don't want to stand in front of the sink waiting for it to heat up.The only thing we have found wrong is it does not fit Tommee Tippee bottles but does fit any Playtex and Dr. Brown bottle we have tested in it so far :),1
"After trying countless sippy cups, I've deemed these Nuby cups to be the winner. My son loves them and find ssipping from them to be much easier than others. They are reasonably leak-proof (though when then are constantly slammed down or dropped, small droplets will come out). They are fun and colorful, easy to clean and the handles make them easy to grip and tote along with you. For being one of the cheapest sippy cups around, I'm impressed with these.",1
We used these as burp cloths - perfect!,1
The splash guard is a bit high and it makes it difficult for my daughter to sit comfortably on it. Wide seat. I wasnt thrilled. Very basic. Not really good for a girls first potty.,0
I used these religiously when my son was in diapers and I loved them.  They usually lasted quite awhile before they would break. I would recommend them to anyone using prefolds!,1
I bought this mirror for my car and really like it.  I can see my baby perfectly from my rearview mirror.,1
Really enjoy this product. Super soft. Earphone jacks work just fine. Safe volume control. Just wish it held it's shape a bit better because if I put it on in one position but move to a different position it doesn't stay in place. Besides that I love it.,1
"I could repeat all of the great 5-star reviews but you've already read them (or probably will).  This is a very effective product and does all that the good reviews say.  It will not DRY your parts, though, so you'll want to shake off the basket in the sink and place the parts on a towel or a drying rack.Since it works so great, I think that ultimately you loving this basket will be determined by how often you need/use it.  If you need 3 bottles a day, only own 3 bottles, and don't want to run your dishwasher every day, you'll end up thinking this is useless even though it works great.  You either need more bottles/baskets or more dirty dishes. ;)As a stay at home mom who cooks for every meal and exclusively bottle feeds, I have enough dishes to run my dishwasher almost every day.  I go through 4-5 bottles a day.  I have TWO of these dishwasher baskets so this system works PERFECTLY for us - I hope that helps.I was concerned about the baskets fitting in my cheap, old, standard-sized dishwasher.  Just so you know, the basket is turned hinged-side-down so that it is positioned upright between columns of prongs instead of over them.  Also, two baskets will fit in the same column on the top rack.  We just reserve the entire left side for baskets/parts & line up the bottles next to them.",1
"Love these . . . lots of letters to make all our names!Cute patterns on each letter.My girls, 6 and 4, love playing with these on the fridge!",1
"The stroller strolls great, but once my kids were near the weight limit (my younger one was 23lbs in the back and older was 35 in the front--weight limit is 33 in back and 50 in front), the stroller was harder to maneuver.THIS IS NOT A TRUE JOGGER.  It is far too heavy even when our little ones were only 14lbs and 26lb.  It is hard to control with only one hand.Hoods are helpful only when the sun is coming from the back--otherwise, they don't shift in different positions.The under basket is completely useless when you have the toddler seat attached to the back--forget about getting things in and out of there when you have a baby who is sleeping and you don't want to disturb or when the second baby is kicking you.  The basket is also a bit hard to reach when the stroller is set to newborn carriage (flat position) and the toddler is clipped to the front.  Usually, our baby was asleep and you would really have to reach to get to what you needed in the basket.Don't even think about strapping on your diaper bag on the handlebars when you have more than one child--either it hits the newborn in the flat position or constantly right in front of the toddler in the rear seat.Reclining is also useless if there is a second child in the back.  The child in front can only recline so much before they are invading their younger sibling's space.  Also, the rear can recline but only about 5 degrees more than the upright position.The stroller was a bit more functional once we bought the extras--the panier bags so that we can store kids things without using the under basket, the double sun cover so that they had sun protection, the hang bag so that we can quickly store cups and the food tray so that our child in front can snack while we were out.  It is just annoying because of the money you spend, you would think they would think of these little conveniences.In the end, I wish I would have spent an extra $100-150 to get the higher end models--the vibe.  At least with the vibe, you can fold the stroller with both seats attached as opposed to having to remove the second seat to fold down.  The higher end models also had sun hoods that were more retractable and can move to fully protect.  The higher end models also had more comfortable seats because it comes with the standard cushy pad.",0
My son is almost 2. This is exactly what I was looking for: a booster seat that could adjust for the table. Works great!,1
"I absolutely love having this diaper caddy! My husband and I love that we can keep all of our son's diapering supplies organized and in one simple place (other than his diaper changing table, which is upstairs in his bedroom). We keep this downstairs for quick changes. The product is sturdy and durable. I love the changing pad as well, as it has a plastic coating on it, which makes it very easy to clean. Well worth the price and would definitely make the purchase again if given the choice.",1
"All the cuteness without the pain!  Getting more sets.  We can both wear them, my daughter is one and I no longer wear regular earrings so these are fun for me too!",1
it does not fit and enlogated toliet seat but if you have a round bowel it should work perfectly but not on the longer ones,0
"Granddaughter is 6 months old, and I think we've only used it a couple of times. She didn't seem comfortable in it and didn't want to stay long in it.",0
"I am very happy with this lock, it is super cute and it does its job.  We have been to sea world with our stroller and I wouldn't have been comfortable leaving our stroller unlocked.  I would recommend this lock to anyone looking for a great stroller lock.",1
"there is nothing wrong with the product but in the picture and video looks bigger than really is, personally i recommend this carrier but you might get wrong idea with the zise",1
Loved the 2 classical songs and my grandson follows  the balls one to the next as they light up. You can set each feature for 10 minutes.  helps him fall asleep.,1
"We ordered these clouds to put up in my son's room with some peel and stick airplanes. The Airplanes were MUCH MUCH easier to put up, and are moveable, but these look fantastic!! My hubby wasn't very excited about rubbing them onto the walls, but once he got the hang of it, it went smoothly and again- they look fantastic!! Very large and realistic looking. We put them up on sky blue walls, and are very pleased with how they look.",1
"This thing does not keep in smells at all. It's in my daughters' bedroom, hanging on the far wall. The smell is so strong that you can detect it in the hallway.I've never had this issue in a wetbag before. Even the little $7 cheapies that I make myself have a far superior level of smell containment. I don't know if there is just something wrong with mine, but it's awful.I think part of the problem is that the outer printed layer of the bag, and the front pocket are cotton (which I didn't realize upon purchase). You can't bleach the bag unless you want to ruin the print that you just shelled out $30 for. We have an especially evil HE washer. Bleaching is required at times to keep the bacteria at bay and smells down. Since I can't bleach this one, the smell is just getting worse with each wash. The bag itself reeks, even without any diapers in it.I'm just really disappointed in this bag. It was so cute, and I hate sewing my own with a passion. I was hoping I could get out of doing it, but that doesn't seem to be the case. I think I'll just stop using it, wash until the stink is gone, and give it to someone who just wants a bag for wet clothes or something.For diapering purposes, especially with our horrible washing machine, it's just not cutting it.",0
"These are sturdy, thick enough to protect my baby's head from our hardwood floors, don't smell, and have no small pieces that my baby could choke on.  Shipping was super quick - I received them one day after ordering them!",1
I bought this for a friend's baby shower and she loved it! It was perfect to stuff with goodies for mom and baby and it's absolutely adorable. If I was having a baby girl I'd buy one for myself!,1
Very good quality. Good price. Stretchy t-shirt material. Loved the colors. Neutral. Can go with most bedding sets. Came fast. Would definitely recommend it. The best bed sheet I have had so far.,1
"There's no gizmos or gadgets with this one but it certainly does its job.  We have it set up in the living room as a diaper changing/nap station.  As she gets older it will be used as a play pen as well.  (And yes I had a little girl and bought this one to match my living room decor!)  The pockets on the side are great - I pack one side with diapers and the other side with baby powder, destin, hand sanitizer, and baby lotion.  The mobile is very boring I don't use it - but I'm thinking about cutting the boring stuff off and attaching some good bright toys for her.",1
"I have bad ankles since birth , this product is amazing . I have tried other products that were a scam . this really works I only wish I had it 30 years ago",1
"Our son loves this tub.  Before he was able to sit in it with water in it, he loved to sit in it dry to play with toys, lol.  Now it is great as a real tub because he likes to ""flop"" about and since it is soft he doesn't hurt himself.  It is a bit bulky, though, so we have to cram it in our smaller than average tub.",1
Seems well made.  Everyone thinks it's funny and cute. My daughter loves the pacifier and loves giving kisses with it.,1
"I initially purchased this from another place online and was aghast with the quality of the bag when I received it. The stitching on the ""leather"" trims was uneven and there were threads hanging lose all over the handles, and it just looked very cheap for an item of this price range. I decided to return it, hoping that I must have received a bad one, and as Amazon never disappoints, ordered it here when they started carrying it for a decent price. I just got it today, and though it is much better looking than the previous one- it still leaves a lot to be desired. I am a fan of Skip Hop products, this item is not holding up the name/quality of the brand though. It looks lovely from a distance, but if you inspect it closely, there are workmanship issues- it just seems like it was put together in a hurry! I would like to see better quality for an item that sells for so much. I even wrote to the company after my original experience, because they need to address this problem considering this is something from their ""luxe"" collection. Have yet to receive a reply. Will update review when and if they do write back.On the plus side, the bag is pretty good size and has several compartments to fit all baby and mommy needs. I got this pattern because it is much more feminine and looks very chic. The material is poly-canvas and easy to wipe clean. The depth is nice and roomy as well... I just wish it was constructed better.",0
My baby girl is in a hurry to grow up and always like to be sitting up like a big girl.  Since she wants to be in on the action this seat allows me to set her where she can see and be sitting up.  She loves it and it's so convenient to have.  Easy to clean off and supports the baby well.,1
Grandson would scream when parents tried brushing his teeth.  He loves the finger one.  I recommend it.  Great product to use,1
These are definitely not the kind of white plastic that matches other outlet covers. They have a very noticeable blue tint to the plastic that doesn't look right compared to other outlets or even white trim. These did not pass the wife inspection.,0
"While the Dutailer products are pricy, they are well worth the money.  This recliner will be around for years to rock my children and grandchildren.  When my son was born 5 years ago, we searched for a good rocker and sat in hundreds. We chose this product and use it every single night to read books to my son.  When my step daughter had her first child in Sept 11, we bought this for them. I bought yet another for my daughter when she had her daughter this April.The cushions are comfortable and easy to wipe clean when needed.  Even the lighter colors do not show or hold dirt very much.  The rocker mechanisms are very smooth and soothing to a young child.  I would highly recommend having the ottoman -- and specifically the nursing stool option if you are nursing.  We don't use that much now as my son is bigger but used it all the time when I was nursing him.  The wood is high quality as well.  I really love this product, I better since I keep buying them!  I expect that this rocker will stay in my son's room for years, and my daughters will be using theirs for years to come as well.",1
"My daughter loves playing with these in the bath. They stick to the bathtub well also. They are quite small, but I knew that before I purchased it and they work great for our needs.",1
These are very nice and thicker than the others. They lock together easily and are also easy to clean. Its saved many of bumped head with our 1 year old.,1
"This sippy is so frustrating because it is really a great cup, but the spouts will wear out so fast it is a ripoff. I have some Nuby soft spout cups that have lasted probably five times as long and have still not needed to be replaced. I bought two of these, and both spouts have worn out. To make matters worse, I can't find these or the replacement spouts in any stores, so I would have to purchase the replacement spouts online.  It's unfortunate because these would have been great to transition from a bottle, and they even have caps for travel. They need to improve the spout!",0
I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation. This is awesome product fits very well to my iPhone 5s. Will recommend it to anyone around me.,1
"I am expecting boy and girl twins, our first babies after years of trying to get pregnant. So they are very happily expected and I do read a lot about how to take care of them. We live in South America, in Uruguay, where I had never heard about swaddling and it's benefits before. I foind lots os information aboutnit on the web, talked to pediatritians and definitely got convinced of trying to use this technique with our babies.This was the first swaddlig blanket I got, and since the twins are coming only in a few months, I did test the technique with my old own teddy bear, and I must say that it is very easy to follow the instructions on the label of the blanket. It's a very good idea to print the instructions on the label and this label is well located to see these instructions clearly while you're swaddling.I can imagine lots of other uses for this blanket, in fact I also ordered one with polka dots, one with the turquoise birds design, and 2 marquisette blankets, more light in weight, with this same kiwi paisley design.Talking about design, I absolutely love the kiwi paisley style!!! Both colors and motifs are cute and easy to match, fabric is soft and breathable and not only wash well but also dry well open air (this is a plus for me cause everytime I can avoid using the dryer I do, letting babies stuff dry at full sun).The only thing I don't like too much is that design is shown only on one face, the inner face is just white and shows the design just a bit, so blanket is not really reversible, but of course this is not important and I am still rating these fabulous blanket, that I hope my twins will use for years, big and bright 5 stars :)",1
"Does the job, covers the outlets. Our son has not tried to pick them off or anything. We also don't have any issue removing them easily to plug something in. Good product, decent price.",1
Crib is just what I my husband and I were looking for.  Very beautiful and was easy to put together!!  Thank you.,1
"my grandaughter loves pocoyo, so when i saw this i thought it would be perfect. she loves it , very colorfull. material is so soft and quality is very good. the comforter is reversible which is nice. it came within a few days and i'm very pleased.",1
"The stache's came on time and looked like the picture.  No complaints about the company.  The product was sticky enough to stay on, but don't change your facial expression as it will start to peel off.",1
These fit my daughter great at 11 months. They are tight on her but not so tight I feel they will give her a headache. I also tried them on myself and they fit up to my size and don't feel to tight on me. Can't wait for summer so we can take our little one racing with us and not have to worry so much about how loud the cars are.We bought the baby ear muffs and these at the same and we are keeping these ones as the baby are way to loose and she can easily pull them off her head were as these ones won't slide off as easy.,1
My son loves chewing on these teethers. They are safe and easy to clean. It has different textures and super easy to handle. Highly recommend these!,1
"This is a great diaper bag backpack overall. I was looking for something to distribute the weight as my previous diaper bag was messenger style and the weight on my shoulder and neck was getting to be too much. The only cons I have for this bag are these two: one, the rectangle you put at the bottom to make a flat bottom digs into your back a little bit at first. I have either gotten use to it or it has softened so it is not too noticeable after a week of use. Two, being on your back it is not as easy to access when you store things like your wallet and phone in it, you will have to take the bag off to access these things unlike with the messenger bag.Outside of these two cons, it has great storage and holds everything I need (clothes, diapers, wipes, diaper cream, snacks, sippy cup, binkies, wallet, cell phone, keys, etc.)One thing to keep in mind with any back pack, especially one that just snaps closed, it is easy for someone to sneak behind you and reach in to steal things. This has never happened to me, but I have heard it does happen with backpack purses and such.",1
"We had a September baby and used this once the weather got cold.  This was so handy and convenient in not having to bundle up our daughter each time we went out. This was especially handy since it had a build in blanket so I never forgot one.  If it was warmer out, we would just keep in open.  At about 5-6 months (24&#34;) she was getting a bit big and her feet were pressing against the bottom.  Now at almost 7 months, we're still using it since its been a cold spring but she doesn't like being in it.  I think she may feel cramped in it and likes to poke her head out as much as she can.  You won't get too long of a use but highly recommend it if you have a small baby.  It fit my Graco snugride 45 pretty well.",1
I love this drying rack! It holds so many bottles and nipples and pacifiers all while not taking up too much room,1
"I had this product on my registry bc of the great reviews it had but I was not impressed.  The velcro is rough, large and very loud.  Every time it was time for a diaper change youd have to undo the whole thing and the velcro was just too loud and would wake my lo up.  It would work great on a doll that doesnt move! It was hard to get my daughter to keep her arms down while I swaddled her so her arms would sometimes come out. The neck area is also rough so it would look very uncomfortable for her.  My advice, save your,moneyand buy good old blankets and swaddle the old fashion way!",0
"I wasn't originally planning on using a bottle warmer...didn't think it was needed.  I was wrong! We were heating up tap water in a cup and placing the bottle in the cup to warm up...that took WAY TOO LONG!  I purchased this warmer because of it's size and the other online reviews I had read.  All you do is plug it in, fill the measuring cup to the desired level(you might have to do some trial and error here to get the right water amount) pour the water in and press the start button.  The great thing is it will automatically shut off when the heating process is finished.  I use Gerber bottles and it works well!  It works with ANY bottles though.  It's soooo easy to use!",1
The breast shield and the part it attaches to is one piece making it harder to store.  When it comes to using it for pumping the place where the tube attaches is on the top.  when the milk comes in it get sucked up and into the tubes causing issues.  I am not giving it one star because I can still use some of the parts but not the main items it was bought for.,0
"It is very good quality , I hope it will stay that way. It is exactly what I needed for our jeep strollers",1
so the sound does not work. at all. and after the second night the rotator in the bulb or whatever the mechanism is stopped working so now its essentially just an overpriced flash light. you have to press REALLY HARD to get the color to change and the two buttons on the side do absolutely nothing. waste of money.,0
"I haven't used this product yet (my baby is only a month old), but I'm satisfied with what I've seen so far. It's what I remember rubber pants to be from my childhood. The only downside to these is that they run a little large so keep that in mind when ordering. My one month old is still too small for the newborn size.",1
"We were looking for a high-end but lightweight, compact, travel-friendly stroller. Our umbrella stroller wasn't cutting it anymore, and our Bob Revolution stroller was too bulky for travel, daily errands, and our sedan trunk. The Britax B-Agile is light; I can carry our 25lb baby in one arm and the stroller in another arm, up and down stairs; it is compact (went to the beach and could pack all our family's items plus the stroller in our Infiniti sedan trunk); it is super easy to fold up (just grab by the carry handle and press a button-it collapses to almost flat.  The sunshade is huge.  The storage below the baby is adequate and comparable to that of the Bob.  The stroller also has a reclined position for the baby, which is as easy as pressing a button to let it down, or pulling a strap to raise it up. Handle bar is a good height...I'm tall and like that I don't have to bend over to reach it.  I'll probably keep the Bob for running on rough terrain, but that's about it.",1
Very cute and fancy for a girly; i prefer the one with the terry side though as it absorbs better baby' spit.,1
"Was looking for something that was more than just a mirror, but didn't want something with a lot of lights and sounds. This is perfect! Great size, easy to see my son, but doesn't block my view too much.",1
"I was excited about this changing table, with the perfect color and adorable shape - until we opened the box. The material is VERY flimsy. The sides and back are a thin composite bendable board, which was a disappointment, but not altogether a deal breaker. What is a deal breaker is that the very thin bendable composite material also makes up the top of the item - where you change your baby! I am really hesitant to place my baby on any surface that I can bend easily. Also, the wood grain on the composite material doesn't match the pieces that are actual wood - they look like they are from an entirely different piece.As if that weren't bad enough, the assembly is ridiculous. My husband is great at putting things together (lots of IKEA furniture in his past!) and he put the crib together in under an hour. This changing table was so frustrating that it took him forever and he had to leave it and come back to it out of frustration.We are trying to decide if dealing with getting this thing back in the box and paying for shipping is worth it to return it. Bottom line is that there are a lot of changing tables out there so you should do yourself a favor and keep looking  - at least for one without a  flimsy particle board changing area.",0
"I thought this monitor set would solve all our problems -- ability to listen to 2 children and have receivers in different rooms.  Yes, it does that but there is a lot of static and the receiver had to be turned up too high in order to hear the kids.  The scanning feature was a big disappointment -- probably the biggest disappointment with this unit.  The scanning feature allows you to listed to each monitor for a few seconds each. Problem is, if you are only using 2 of the 3 units then you will hear unit 1, unit 2 and then static for the unit not being used.  That is very annoying.  It should only scan units currently in use -- or at least not deliver static for the unit not used.In short, this unit offers more than is delivered.",0
"This is literally the stroller blanket I have been searching for.  I love the soft flannel on the inside, and the gorgeous print on the outside.  The outside is made of Jersey.  Best of all, the ties are great, so that the blanket isn't constantly slipping from my stroller or baby bjorn.  This is great for any mom who wants a soft blanket for baby when she's running around town.",1
"These things actually make me enjoy cloth diapering! So much easier to use these especially when there is a poop involved. Makes clean up easy. If your baby is a frequent walker or crawler, be prepared for it to shift once and awhile.",1
This is wonderful for holding those small bath toys that clutter up the bathtub. Our son's toys can all stay together and make the bathroom look messy.,1
"This perfectly solved our problem.  There are no holes in the banister, but there's a gate securely protecting the stairs.",1
"For anyone that breastfeeding is important to, this is the pump for you! Especially for full-time working moms!! I was able to keep at my goal of breastfeeding for 6 months and kept my supply regulated with this dream of a pump! I can't say enough good things about it. Try it yourself and you will see. It is definitely worth the money!",1
"Quick to use - but the grooves in the bowl are harder to clean? I realize it helps with mushing food, but it takes more effort if your food is not super steamed and mushy. Its okay.",0
"I would give this product more stars if they were available :-) We bought this for her last month and it's her favorite thing in the whole world right now.  We actually have to move it from room to room so she can stare at herself and the lion almost continuously :-)  It's absolutely hysterical to watch her giggle, laugh, and talk to her reflection in the mirror... it's totally one of the best things I've ever bought!",1
My wife and I found  this nail clipper very useful. The magnifier is really an invention; your baby can't get hurt!,1
"The openings on this cup are a bit too large for the little ones.  When they started to drink the got a face full of milk, as they are used to using their sippy cups.  I thought this would be a good transition, but it didn't work.",0
This is a very cute diaper bag and I love the extras that comes with it. Would make a very cute baby shower gift.,1
"This is SUCH a good idea.  I felt like I was freezing my child not putting a blanket on them as they slept to keep them safe.  This put my mind at ease and kept the little one warm.  I HIGHLY recommend it.  They also make them in lighter materials, which is great for warmer houses and weather.",1
Ordered to have for nephew. Great price safe product. Would definately recommend to others and have. Thank you so much,1
"These are the blocks babies should play with. They stack easy, they make a soft bell like noise when shaken, they have cute pictures and letters and numbers and are SOFT. Must have for babies - my 2 year old still plays with them. My 1 year old loves them.",1
I wanted this in red but got black. The color black collects too much lint. But I do like the product.,0
"As with most things, this might not work for everyone. For us it's perfection. I like to make my son's food as fresh as possible because i believe in cooking in-season and local and i am not interested in making months worth of frozen stuff. I usually make 3 batches in a row and portion them out, which gives me about 3 days worth of food.If i do zucchini and carrots it takes 25 minutes from start to finish and most of that time, it's steaming and i don't have to pay attention. Initally i made everything special, but now i add things we already have and simply puree them. Tonight we are having mix veggies, brown rice and slow cooked pork. I put a spoon of each, blended and voila!Yes i could take out a pot, steam, then take out a blender and have a mountain of dishes. Instead i just wash this...it is perfection!I must say i find the price steep. You can easily find a used one and that's the way to go.",1
My son loves this potty monkey and attached to it real quick! He does not understand the concept of potty yet but I think that this will def. help him potty train much faster!,1
"The company who sent this did a great job.  Unfortunately it was lost in transit and they immediately sent out another one upon learning of the situation.  When we got it, it was the size we expected and just as cute too.  The bummer is that it is to be placed by the bedside for reading and is listed to only be used with a 40 watt bulb.  I can't imagine who thought that was practical.  To me it seemed obvious to be used for a reading lamp, but I guess we are all different as to our expectations.  We ultimately did returned it.  It was not a good choice for us in the end, but their customer service was excellent.",0
"This nappy was perfect. My baby girl just started swim classes and she was required to have a disposable swim diaper and a swim nappy. I thought this was a little pricey, but we will be able to use it for quite a while since there are drawstings so we can adjust the size.",1
"My son seems to love anything with fish, so I thought he would enjoy this. I put him in his crib around nap time, and turned it on. He instantly relaxed,with in a few minutes he was asleep.The motor is louder than I expected, but noise doesn't seem to bother him. I am happy with my purchase.",1
My three year old nephew loves this toy which I gave him for his birthday.  His mother chose it as an appropriate gift for him and she was right.,1
Only battery-operated night light that I could find that had the option of turning off the automatic shut-off (so that it stays on all night).,1
"This toy is sturdy.  The mixer part comes off and can be played with separately.  The shapes are good to use to teach colors, as well.  The truck is fun with or with out the mixer. My son loves putting the shapes in the mixer! We've had this toy since he was 8 months.  He's now 2 and still uses it.",1
"I would recommend buying it when your baby is 3months if he/she have a good head control muscle it would support the baby a 100%.  I discover the Hugga-bebe Infant Support Cushion when my son was just turning 4months, i wish i bought it sooner because my son totally love this product. We use it on his jumperoo and it totally supported him, he no longer fall in forward or backward. I do wish it came with drool pads or something but i just put a bib on him or put a diaper cloth on top cause he does soak them wet with drool.  It is a washable product though. Also Hugga Bebe is made with a very soft material but its thick so it gets hot in summer time. The only reason i gave it 4 stars is because of the price but great invention.",1
"I originally bought a silicone mat for when we were eating out, but my toddler can now pick that up and throw it.  These mats are a great option and they stick very well.  The only downside is that sometimes they stick too well and it's difficult to get them back up.  Regardless, they are very convenient and are the best brand of disposable mats that I have found.",1
"Bebe Dubon Bottle and Nipple Brush with Sponge Tip, Colors May Vary. It's really bad quality. Head and tail breaks after a few times using. Not recommend.",0
"We purchased this pump prior to the birth of our daughter.  I highly recommend this pump for many of the reasons listed by others who have reviewed it on this site.  The pump is lightweight and portable.  It does look like an ordinary black backpack so you do not have to try and hide the pump and accessories.  I, personally, do not use the bottles for feeding, but I do use them for storage in the fridge before I make my baby's bottles (I use the Playtex Premium Nursers).  Although I am not a very good milk producer, I still pump several times a day in order to give my daughter all the breast milk I can provide, even though we still have to supplement formula.  I have not tried any other pump, so I cannot compare it to a manual pump or hospital grade of another variety, however, this pump is fast and efficient.  The cooling bag is wonderful.  I bring it into our bedroom at night and store bottles in there for when my baby wakes up (usually at 4 AM) so we don't have to go downstairs.  The ice pack stays frozen all night, and it worked great on an overnight trip to Boston.  It's also great that you can purchase replacement pieces and larger flanges in the stores or on the internet.I also recommend the Medela Micro-steam bags for cleaning pump parts (and nipples & pacifiers).  They are wonderful when you need to clean the parts quickly and don't have the time to wash everything by hand or boil the water.The only issue I had was that for awhile I had only been able to get suction from one valve/flange and could not pump both breasts at the same time.  I soon found out that the face plate over the motor was not properly attached.  I had to find a small piece of paper in the box that advised of this issue - and all I had to do was remove the faceplate and attach it again - this was not listed in the FAQ in the users manual.  It would have saved me many days of one-breast pumping had I found the reason for the problem earlier (in the manual).",1
"OK... I love this thing.  I'll start off, then by saying why I gave it a star off.  I am a shorter person (5'2"") and the belt is supposed to fit on your waist very tightly.  When I wear it, it digs in into right under my ribs, and it hurts.  But... the pain is worth it!!!So, the brand name on this thing is Jerry Baby.  It is strong, it is blue, and the back panel is made of mesh and is removable.  You zip the panel on and secure the zipper with a snap so it doesn't unzip.  The neck strap is not the most secure thing in the world to hold your baby, especially facing out, so hold that kid with your arm!  The strap clips and unclips with a sturdy but easy to open buckle (you can use one hand, but it's covered with fabric so the baby can't do it).  You can remove the foam pad for washing the fabric, but you do not get any neat extra pockets or anything for keys or whatnot.  You velcro the waist strap tightly around your waist like a corset, and then you buckle the strong buckle on top of that.Anyway, I have an Ergo carrier, a mei tai carrier, and 22 lb. 6-month-old baby that ""just wants to be held.""  The Ergo is lovely, but it's flipping hot here in the MidWest right now, and even my performance fabric Ergo is sweltering.  Plus, baby does not like to be crammed against me for more than 1/2 an hour before he wants to move and, you know, breathe and stuff (he really can breathe... he just feels a little scrunched and so do I).  Plus, getting him in and out of the carrier every time I moved around the house or diapered him or got in and out of the car was kind of sucky.  The mei tai was awesome in the winter when he was 7 lbs. and it was freezing outside.  Now, no more mei tai.Also, I should mention that Heavy Meatloaf Child caused me to have a compressed ulnar nerve, carpal and cubital tunnel syndrome, and numb ring fingers that I could set on fire and not feel a thing from.  Also, I have Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS) from car accidents.  If you are not familiar with this lovely disorder, it has horrible flare-ups that websites helpfully suggest you avoid by not..umm...carrying heavy objects or Heavy Meatloaf Children with your arms.  Also, you should not have heavy items with straps sitting on your shoulders.  So basically, I should never pick up Heavy Meatloaf Child or put him in a sling.Somehow, I ended up Googling something that led me to hip seats and this was the brand I settled on because it was cheap but not too cheap.  It seems to be a knock-off brand of another one (the heart-shaped butt pad gives that away, read: Baby Nari), but it works.I started using it the minute it came in from Amazon.  I put it on (there were no instructions included in the fancy wrapping which was a plastic bag) with the carrier portion and set Meatloaf on it facing out.  He loved it.  I was able to do dishes (one-handed mostly), vacuum, make the dog's food, etc.) and young Meatloaf sat there, pleased as a Pasha, and didn't cry like he does when he's displeased (which is pretty much whenever he's in his bouncy seat so I can get stuff done).  I also removed the front part for a bit and just used the seat part to get him around the house and ready for his bath.Next, I decided to take the Jerry Baby for its maiden voyage to Whole Foods.  That place is full of people who wear babies, so I figured I wouldn't stick out, but I was kind of scared someone might see Meatloaf facing out, assume he was in a Baby Bjorn, and come lecture me on the evils of crotch-dangling my child.  No one did.  Some people even smiled benevolently as Meatloaf drooled all over his own shirtfront.I digress.  With the Jerry Baby, I was able to get Meatloaf in and out of his carrier and car seat with speed and a modicum of grace.  I grabbed a mini Whole Foods cart and did my shopping in record time.  We did not bump into anything or anyone.  Meatloaf was super-stimulated by all the goings-on at WF.  As we drove home, a storm started.  I managed to prop an umbrella over the car door, put Meatloaf back in his carrier from the car seat, and carry the umbrella, the Meatloaf, and two bags of groceries into the house without anyone getting wet.  That was amazing.The only caveat is that you must be careful of not bumping your baby's head when putting him/her from the carrier into the car seat if you drive a regular-sized car.  The seat of the carrier is higher than you think.  Don't ask me how I know.Well, after our WF trip, I got Meatloaf ready for bed and lay him down to sleep.  Usually, he puts his butt up in the air and squirms around and makes a lot of noises.  This time, he just lay there like a pancake, looking at me out of the corner of his eye, and fell right asleep.  Like, right there, on the spot.  I think facing out like that worked his core muscles, and watching the guy slice the bread and seeing the people walking around at WF really stimulated him quite a bit.Win for the Jerry Baby!EDIT: OK, so here's what I've found this to be great for and not great for over time.  It's FANTASTIC for strolling and moseying.  I use it all the time in the house, the grocery stores, to take the dog out to pee, to get to the car and back.  One day, however, I used it for an actual 30 minute dog walk and by the end of ten minutes, I was in excruciating hip pain.  I felt like my pelvis was about to pop off my spine.  There was searing pain in my hip joint.  I have never had this problem with my Ergo, but sadly, the baby does not enjoy the compression aspect of being in the Ergo on walks anymore.  Anyway, it was brutal.  It took me three or four days to recover; now I can wear the hip seat again in my moseying endeavors.  I would not recommend it for fast walks in place of a carrier.  Others may have a different experience, though, of course.",1
Overall it is a good swaddle but as my dd moves around the swaddle pieces can get bunched up by her face.  When I check in on her I have to pull the cloth down.  Also the velcro is loud when you are trying to discretely adjust the swaddle.,0
"I've had travel wipe cases from Huggies and Pampers and this UberMom case is lower quality. Mine doesn't snap open/closed. It just... sort of fits together. It's not a random defect as the item does not have any snapping mechanism. It simply doesn't snap shut and wasn't made to. I'm certain that if I ordered another, it'd be the same. Maybe I'll upload a photo so ya'll can see what I'm trying to describe. BUT! Liquid doesn't leak out and my wipes stay wet so it seems fine!",0

It does address the problem, but the arm is not quite a malleable as you woudl hope.  That being said it is strong and does not look like it will break - I'd rather err in this direction.  The color is okay, the radius of the umbrella is good.  I don't have the sight issues that were mentioned in the other reviews, but I am 6'4"".  All in all. I'd buy again.",1
"Absolutely odor free!!!! easy to clean up, easy to dispose, absolutely a must have.... I have tried a few other brands all of which eventually end up leaking odor. This one is very practical, easy to use and locks in the odor.",1
Went 2 years without something under our car seats and now that we bought these I feel a lot better about the condition of the seat underneath. The only complaint I have is the part that slides into the seat joint gets in the way of one of my 'LATCH' hooks.,1
"I really like this stroller and I would buy it again. My son usually fall asleep while I'm running so it's obviously comfortable for him. I like how the canopy moves so you can block the sun better. I think it rides pretty good but I feel like my son bounces around a bit when I roll over a big bump but he doesn't seem to mind. I thought it was fairly easy to put together also. I learned very quickly that it's a lot harder running with a jogger only because you have to push the stroller but it makes it a better work out, that's for sure. Plus, you have to get use to not swinging your arms. But I enjoy the stroller. Its is bigger and heavier but I don't think it's used for every day errands. I like that the wheel in the front doesn't rotate. When you are running, I like that the wheel is sturdy. Yes, it makes it harder to turn but I'd rather that be the issue then the safety of my child if the wheel decided to get crazy and move a certain way that would harm my little boy. :)",1
"Previously wrote a bad review on this toy b/c it came in with string like plastic on it.  Once you remove all the plastic strands, it's a wonderful toy.  My 5 month has loved it since she's been 3 months old.  Jacquez the Peacock and Marina the Mermaid are her favorites.",1
I had bought a different brand first that had the spout on the side.  It was terrible.  The seals broke after only a couples uses.  This product however has very durable seals and I love that you refill it from the bottom.  Works way better!,1
My daughter loves to use her pink princess water bottle when we travel or play outside.  So far the characters haven't been scratched off and it hasn't leaked.,1
Only works on our indoor doors. Our outside doors are too thick. Could use a longer pull on the one install on our basement door. We have to get on the next to last step to reach the pull.  Tried a few of the door handle open preventers and they didn't work so well.,1
The only reason I did not rate this 5 stars is because I wish it was bigger BUT I love the way it folds so easily. Great blanket. Recc'd it!,1
"Bought this for an old Pali crib that was given to us by friends.  Did not know how it would fit, but it fits perfectly, has the same sliding mechanism as the drop side, so you can use it either in an up or down configuration (both give protection, one is just a bit lower).  It does what I need it to do.  My toddler can get in an out of her bed easily but hasn't fallen out once.",1
A nice durable product with a surprised refill option. Was pleased to find that out. Makes the price not so pricy.,1
cant eating without it for my baby.  easy wash.  i even put in dishwasher. its fine. can wash by dishwasher.,1
"We bought this noise maker about a year ago and have used it every single day since then (we use it about 12 hours every day).  We use the white noise feature and its just loud enough to block outside noises without being too loud for my son's ears.  My son has become afraid of the dark so we started using the nightlight too.  Since we began using the nightlight he has stopped waking up and calling for us in the middle of the night.  The blue colored light is subtle enough that its not too bright but at the same time allows him to see enough of the room to be less scared.  He calls the nightlight the ""moon"" and loves turning it on and off before bed.We've taken it traveling and it easily fits in a suitcase and has not broken after getting jostled around a bit.Honestly, I have nothing negative to say about this product.  It works great, it still works great after 12 hour a day usage for a year, my son loves it, and we love it because it means more sleep for us.I would HIGHLY recommend this product!!",1
"I was using Medela nipples until my pediatrician showed me how much they stunk!  Then when I switched to these, going back and forth from breastfeeding to bottlefeeding was SO much smoother (as they say it should be)...  I am thankful for the genius who invented them!",1
I did not like that it was a bit tedious to remove as well as it was very delicate and could easily rip when removing from the film which is why I gave it 4 stars.  That however is not too bad as long as your careful.  I loved the colors and movement that you see once completed! My sons absolutely love this!,1
"We ordered the oak finish rocking horse and it arrived quickly. Assembly was very easy as the only tool needed was a ""Phillips"" screwdriver. It took me less than 10 minutes to assemble. All the pieces arrived complete and in tact.The oak finish is an attractive compliment to our furniture.  The brown yarn used for the mane & tail is stapled on so I can see it coming off after being tugged on a while. It should be easy enough to reattach with a heavy duty staple gun, or maybe with a few decorative brass screw like I'm thinking of doing anyway.The size of the horse is perfect for our 19 month old who is about 33"" tall and 25 lbs. I was also surprised at how solid and sturdy it felt once assembled. I'm about 215 lbs and it feels like it could support my weight if I carefully sat on it.. although I'm not about to try it. I would say this horse could *easily* support a 60-70 lb child. The reason it's so sturdy, is because they inserted threaded brass sleeves into the wooden pieces, in which the brass screws can thread into. This provides a metal on metal point of contact rather than metal on wood. Thus eliminating weak spots at the load bearing points.We paid less than $50 for the product. Our daughter loves it. It looks nice in the home. She should get a couple years use out of it unless she keeps ""shooting"" upward like summer corn.The reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is because it doesn't seem to rock quite as good as some of the spring mounted horses we looked at. I think this style is a bit safer for a toddler so it's a tradeoff.Thanks for reading.",1
I got this set at walmart for under $100... great buy. I would def. recommend. Looks beautiful in the room for my little girl!,1
"i have twin 2 year old boys and i have one of these for each of them and i would be lost without them! my boys are very big for their age and these fit great and they're not strong enough to bust through the velcro no matter how hard they try. i love them because we can go for walks and they can run a little bit ahead of me and explore but still be kept safe without having to hold my hand. i can load one up in his carseat and not have to worry about the other one escaping into a busy parking lot while i have my back turned.yes, you might get looks from people who think those of us who put our kids on 'leashes' are awful parents, but i find the safety of the most precious people in the world to be far more important.i HIGHLY recommend these for your toddlers.",1
I was introduced to this baby carrier by one of the instructors at a prenatal education classes that I attended who raved about it.  I decided to buy it and try it on my twins because it was less expensive than the other baby carrier styles.  My babies didn't take to this carrier and didn't like being placed in this at all.  Putting it on was a pain too.  Ended up returning this and now have a BabyBjorn carrier.,0
"This is a really good product, easy to use, and when you are working around in the room, the baby can have his meal without help.",1
"This car seat has many pluses that override its only minus.The pluses are the comfort which helps baby tolerate long trips. Its padding doesn't get very hot even in Texas summers. There are left and right cup holders large enough for every baby item. It was easy to install.The only minus is the strap tightener and un-tightener, it is quite awkward and really needs improvement at teh design level. How about something resembling how an actual seatbelt can be pulled out and then self-coils when done?",1
"We've had this for well over a year now. It's a well made product, compared to the terrible Motorola product we had before.This one doesn't hammer our wifi too badly. That was a major concern after our experience with the previous baby monitor. Batteries in the display also last 2 or 3 hours without being connected. that's been a nice surprise.My only want in a product like this is a USB connector for charging, and a microphone feedback system. the Motorola unit we had previously could &#34;talk back&#34; from the display to the camera.",1
"These bottles are terrific. They not only fit onto the pump, but are great to feed from as well. Thanks.",1
"This stroller is lightweight and really easy to expand/collapse even when holding a squirming kid. It's comfortable and the compartment underneath is just big enough to fit a few essentials and the 'tray' up top is also very handy and the right size for keys/phone/water bottle, etc.  It's also pretty sturdy and doesn't look like the cheapy strollers you see for $10 or whatever.  Overall I'm pleased with it.  We bought it to take on vacation with us and it held up well and took a beating.  I have 2 cons - 1) the canopy is completely useless, but we've solved that by using a hat instead; and 2) the handles are just a little low and close, I'm 5'6 and have to hunch just slightly when pushing it and they're also just a little to close to the stroller (meaning I occasionally kick the tires with my foot when walking).  Those issues are pretty minor and overall I'm very pleased with it.  I have another larger, more expensive stroller that doesn't have those issues, but it's a project getting that thing in and out of a car or up/down stairs.  I find myself preferring this stroller and never even use the other one anymore.",1
"We received this monitor at Christmas and 6 months later it's dead. It's a mixed blessing because I actually hated the stupid thing anyways. Like others have mentioned, it has pretty poor range and the alarm feature is ridiculous. Even when adjusting the sensitivity on the camera, I still couldn't get the handset to stop vibrating/beeping with every.little.noise.  I don't find the picture quality to be overly clear but it definitely does the job. I do like the remote night light and speaker features though.",0
"Evenflo SimpleStep Pressure Gate TaupeExcellent gate particularly for the price.  Much more convenient than stepping over non-swing open type. You should remove 1/4 round trim at floor to mount this gate as low to floor as possible because there is a 1 inch high bottom bar across opening.  Study install instructions BEFORE attempting and it will be easy. When you first take gate out of box, it will look bent--read directions. Comes with width extension. There is a 1/4 inch width in the midrange covered where it will be tricky to mount this gate--I used a soft mallet to bump one of mine into place before adjusting tension.  Use an ordinary carpenter's level to get mounted gate vertical if you like the swing gate to stay open where you leave it. Gate will work regardless.  Use very light silicone spray on latch pin and internal release mechanism and gate will latch/unlatch very easy. If tension pads begin to cup into wallboard/plaster you will need to attach 1 X 3 X 30 inch boards to walls to mount gate against.  One of mine was mounted against a vertical iron bannister rail by making adapter from short piece of 1 X 3 wood and 2 saddle clamps for $2 from hardware store. (To get ideas look at Evenflo mounting kit.)  My 11 month-old granddaughter is already pushing on one release button but I cannot imagine her being able to squeeze both simultaneously as well as slide handle against spring tension for 3--4 years?She can, however, open the dog's cage now.",1
I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation. I received the phone case much faster than the delivery date stated which was awesome. Overall the phone case provides good coverage of the phone. The only downside to the phone case is that it is kind of slippery so I do find myself dropping or almost dropping the phone sometimes.,1

"My daughter LOVES this toy, it is a favorite. We bought it when she was barely one, and now she's two and it still gets regular use. It is a toy that has been thoughtfully engineered to make the balls roll slowly down the ramps, perfect for little ones to follow. Other reviewers have claimed that it falls over or comes apart too easily, but I think that's purposeful. My daughter gets as much joy out of taking this toy apart and attempting to reassemble as she does with sending the balls down the ramps. The tabs that connect the yellow circle ramp to the red piece below it did break off after a few big crashes, but it still fits together and functions just fine.",1
"We received this as a gift and although we still have yet to buy the 4D batteries to make it work, the seat itself is great. I like how you can remove the waterfall thing and it can just be a seat. She actually slept it in her first week of life because it's elevated and she had reflux. I can type online and bounce it with my foot. I think everyone should have a bouncy seat for their baby.",0
Great product and the best warranty out there. Love the included mesh bag that can be rolled and used whenever you need it. This I haven't seen on any other product. Fits big drinks and water bottles which helps out allot.,1

"I used the original 12 Volt plug that came with my Medela Pump In Style Advanced breast pump for almost two years while breastfeeding my son.  Now since i've had another baby, the original one had exposed wires and stopped working, so I ordered this replacement one.  I wish I had this one from the beginning! It works great and it is SO much lighter than the original!!  Medela should be selling these with their pumps instead of their huge heavy ones.Pay attention when ordering a replacement power supply, though- they are not interchangeable between the 9 Volt and 12 Volt pumps- you need to look at which pump you have.",1

This mat is wonderful. Our 3 month old loves to have a soft spot to do tummy time in our house. We have hardwood floors so its great to open up anywhere without worry. Also it is great for travel.,1
"The product arrived in a protected tube. The instructions were extremely difficult to read - I have good eye site and I had to pull out a magnify glass. Thankfully there was a YouTube link to view because otherwise the written instructions made zero sense. We followed the instructions and during the application process the piece folded on top of itself and since the adhesive was so strong it ruined the whole piece. I contacted the company and they said I should just buy another one. I looked up other companies policies and most say that if an error occurs during the application process they will ship you a new one for free &#8211; you just need to pay for S & H. I DO NOT recommend a wall decal that is one giant piece, opt for ones that are in multiple pieces.",0
I ordered this book as a gift for my youngest granddaughter.  She loves it and wants me to read it to her all the time.,1
"I love this bra!  I bought this bra so that I could pump hands free while at work.  I was nervous about the fit because I have a very large bust and most bras are not large enough.  This bra fit perfectly as I was able to adjust it any way I needed to.  It even came with straps that could go over both shoulders, one shoulder, criss-cross, you name it.  The back has a large velcro panel so you have up to (something like ) 10 inches of extra length.  It also has an extra zipper panel for the front if you need the flange holes to be further apart.  When they say totally adjustable, they mean it.  I will definitely save this bra for future use and recommend it to everyone looking for a hands free bra.  The cost is perfect too, definitely worth the money!",1
"I was so excited to buy the Phil Harmonic when I was still pregnant and the first stage is really soothing with beautiful music.  And I still used it with my baby for the first few months. But then as the stages progressed the less soothing and interesting it became.  To be honest the games in the fourth stage don't even make sense!  It fact it's really annoying!  Rather then let the child explore the sounds and music while pushing and sliding the buttons at a normal pace, the child hears ""hit the lit button"" over and over and over.  Sad to say this one is collecting dust somewhere in my garage.",0
"Great product, my wife uses it all the time to cut our 1 year old's nails who get really sharp for whatever reason.No fear of snipping off little pieces of finger tips anymore which happened a lot with the baby nail clippers.",1

"I thought about buying this for a long time but I hesitated because I was afraid my son would stick the wrong end in his mouth. After watching him chew on bottle nipples and toys for some teething relief, I decided to try it. I presented it to him with the correct end toward his mouth, he started chewing away on it, and now whenever he goes for this teether, he puts it in his mouth correctly and bites down on it. He seems to enjoy it as much, if not more, than any other teether I've tried, so I'm giving it 5 stars. I don't have any concerns about its safety with my son, but of course, I would recommend close supervision until you know your baby has the hang of it. It won't take long.",1
"this is really a great item for baby, he adores it and it squeaks all over, i would def. recommend this item.",1
These are great training pants. not only do they fit well but they let him feel that he is wet and he runs to the potty.,1
"I recently bought this to replace a Chicco Cortina which I'd never really liked but was decent and capable so I felt stuck with it.  But I'd grown increasingly hung up lately on the notion of a rear-facing stroller.  Most people seem to think of it as a feature for smaller babies, but I really wanted it for my 2.25 year old who is talking a ton these days.  When we go out with the stroller she is chattering and singing and asking me questions nonstop in her sweet little voice and I couldn't hear a word she said when she was facing away from me.  I'd seen rear facing strollers around town and assumed they were all crazy expensive but was pleased to find that there were a few mid-priced options available, and finally settled on the Atmosferra.So far, I am very pleased.  The steering is much smoother and easier than with the Cortina.  One-handed steering is really important to me, as I sometimes have to take the dog and stroller out at the same time.  I've never pushed a $1,000+ stroller and probably never will, so I although I wonder if those strollers feel $800+ better to push than this one, I'm satisfied.Love the easily adjustible handle.  Unfortunately, it does rattle a bit as one walks.  Don't like that, as it gives what seems an otherwise sturdy stroller a rickety feel, but perhaps that is common to all telescoping-type handles?  This is the only one I've ever tried.My daughter seems to like the seat and the deep canopy (hates sun in her eyes and this one really blocks sun well).  She also LOVES her snack tray and the cupholder, which keeps her sippy cup firmly in place.  At about 36"" her head is at the top of the seat frame but that doesn't seem to bother her at all because she's always leaning a bit forward to look around, rather than resting her head on it.  I'm sure I could rig up some extra padding if it becomes a problem. Not a deal breaker for me.  The canopy arches higher than the top of the seat frame, so it clears her head with room to spare.When folded, the stroller is VERY bulky and the huge rear wheels jut out, but from our research we knew to expect that.  We plan to use this one only for walks around our city neighborhood, and keep an umbrella-type stroller for the rare occasions we want to take a stroller in the car.  The reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is the trickiness of the fold.  I had to watch the babygizmo video review several times to figure it out and even though I now understand how to do it, it is pretty finicky and definitely is a two-handed fold.  My husband is afraid to even try because he's watched me struggling with it. The seat also must be facing forward to fold the stroller.  Turning it around before folding is a mildly irritating extra step, but I think that may be a common issue with rear-facing strollers.We are hoping to have a baby #2 at some point and I am really excited to try out the basinette feature.  I spent a while going back and forth between this and the Contours Options 3-Wheeler because the Countours is compatible with our Chicco infant carseat but the Atmosferra only accepts Mia Moda's carseat.  The Mia Moda won out in the end because I like that you can make a snug flat basinette out of it, whereas the Countours seat does not go flat.  I think between the basinette and our trusty Ergo carrier and Sleepy Wrap, our hoped-for second baby will make out just fine.  ONE NOTE ABOUT THE BASINETTE:  we got Nero which must be an older color becuase it is cheaper.  The babygizmo video shows a ventilation panel when the seat is fully reclined but our stroller DOES NOT have the ventilation panel.  Not sure whether that feature was just on certain model years.  Wanted to point that out for anyone for whom it might be important.Overall, this is a stylish-looking, versatile stroller and I think it's a pretty good bargain for the price.  If your lifestyle is such that you are constantly in and out of a car, this may not be the best choice, because it's heavy and bulky and has limited travel system compatibility.  I'd recommend it for city dwellers who tend to get around a lot on foot.***Update June 2012****So, we've had this stroller for a year, had our second child, and have put the stroller through its paces.  It has held up well.  It steers really easily, even if heavily loaded with a 3 year old and a basket full of groceries--I can push the baby in it one-handed while holding my older daughter's hand with the other. Daughter is still comfortable in the seat, at age 3 1/2 is pretty much maxing it out height-wise, but doesn't complain.Regarding the bassinette feature--I really like it better than the Chicco travel system which I used when my daughter was a baby.  It seems much cooler for baby during these hot summer months than being strapped into a carseat, and he can nap flat on his back or sit semi-reclined and watch the world go or look at me as we stroll.  The sunshade is awesome.  Switching the seat from bassinet to regular configuration is a bit of a pain, though.  The snaps involved are very stiff and hard to reach, and I do struggle with them, which can be frustrating when I'm in a hurry to get somewhere.  So keep that in mind if you anticipate having to switch it back and forth frequently.Overall, still satisfied with the purchase!",1
"I purchased these via the outlet for a to-die-for price. Unfortunately they are sized 12-18 months and a little big yet for my daughter, but I bet she will be wearing these A LOT in a few months time. I'd recommend them to other parents or as a gift.",1
"This is the best carseat. My son has had it since he turned forward facing and it has been through a lot as he is now 5 and still this is a great seat. Only problem are the nooks and crannies that collect goldfish crumbs, etc., but good luck finding a car seat that won't have that! it is the best expense for your money since it will fit your child FOREVER! We are expected child #2 and when they are ready to move forward facing, I will absolutely be buying this car seat again.",1
"The product itself works great, it's just a little hard to use. It's a little difficult to get the sides squeezed to get it open, and if your cord is larger than the standard size it's a little tight. But it keeps the little people out.",1
Absolutely useless. The sticky tape does not hold the flimsy net. Tape pulled out the paint from the windows. Had to paint the windows again. A rip off. Wonder how Amazon allows such trash to be sold on their website.,0

"This came in a Medela package, and definitely was NOT a Medela product.  No where on the adapter itself does it say it is Medela, and not only that, its a 9 volt, when the Pump In Style requires a 12 v.  This worked once, and completely died.  Waste of money.",0

"i keep this bag in a trash can with a pop up lid. It keeps the smell out. it can hold a lot of diapers! i wash every other day so it doesn't even get full, there is plenty of room for at least three or four days of diapers. I just wish it came in other colors!",1
"I thought this was a tub that would go into the sink while my baby was still an infant. The picture makes it appear this way, but it only works if you have a one compartment sink. This has become a hassle because I fill it and carry it to the living room floor, and not to mention the stress on the back from doing this. This would be a great baby bath if you used it in the big tub, the sling works great--just not what I wanted or expected....I will be buying a different one.",0
"Making fresh, homemade baby food is SO easy with this kit! Assemble the processor in five seconds, throw some steamed produce (and maybe a little liquid) in and press a button. That's all it takes! It has so few parts that washing is ridiculously easy and fast. My only complaint is that after about six months, the hard plastic base that holds the blades cracked, but it hasn't affected it's efficacy at all, even a year later. Now that my child is older, I use it to make sauces and to chop food because it's so much easier to use and clean than my regular food processor or blender.",1
"This is a functional Sippy cup because it changes with your baby and I love that. Also, I love the modern design and it is a neutral color for my future kids. I also like the fact that it is BPA and PVC free, This is very important to me.",1
"I bought this bag about 9 months ago, when my third baby was a newborn.  I have owned other diaper bags in the past, and I had a very specific list of what I wanted in a bag:  I was looking for something very roomy and lightweight.  I cloth diaper, and I wanted to be able to take a couple of cloth diapers, along with the usual other diaper bag stuff, and a snacks for the older kids, and still be able to zip the thing closed.  I also wanted to have pockets  for my stuff, so that when I am out and about with the baby, I don't have to take a purse.  It was very important that I have a place for my cell phone that was easily accessible.  I wanted stroller straps, and I wanted feet on the bottom.  This one fit the bill.  I bought no less than seven different diaper bags (some that cost twice as much) and tried them out at home before settling on this one.  And nine months later, I have to say, I made the right choice.  I have been very pleased.  The fabric, stitching, and hardware have held up amazingly well -- it still looks new.  I stuff it full of all sorts of things, including cloth diapers, and the big pocket on the front will still hold my wallet, while the smaller zip pockets are great for my cell phone and hand sanitizer.  The side bottle pockets hold sippy cups with no problem.  I really like having two different strap options, and the stroller straps are great -- the clasps are very easy to open and close, which is not always the case with other bags.  The last thing you want when you're packing your kids in the minivan is to be wrestling with getting your bag off the stroller because the clasps are too small or too stiff.  It's a breeze with this bag.  The Black Magnolia print is pretty and stylish.  I really can't find anything I don't like about this bag.  It was a great purchase!",1
This works great for keeping my babies bottles dry at work and when I travel. It's not enough at home but great for work and travel.,1
"Our Baby loves this thing. It's so simple yet intriguing to him, which keeps us happy because we feel as if he is entertained, but not overstimulated.Only downside is that he has already ripped a toy off at 5 months.",1
"We use the g-diapers with cloth inserts but was looking for a way to keep the solid waste out of our washing machine and these worked best hands down. I was really suprised to read the negative review saying these stuck to their babies butt...sometimes with a really wet diaper, they do stick a bit, but it's a small price to pay for the superior way the let use separate and throw away the poop from the rest of the diapers. They are soft, flexible and the only ones large enough to wrap all the around the edges of the cloth insert so there is rarely any poop on the cloth diapers at all.The other liners we tried like the kushes roll were just too stiff and seemed to just get bunched up between her legs, letting the sides of the diaper get poop stained. These seem to have a little stickiness to them that gives them better coverage of the cloth insert. This ""stickiness"" also makes it really easy to prepare a bunch of cloth liners (we use the g diaper cloth insert with an additional soaker pad i bought off ebay, a combination which really does the trick for us) so we just have to pop them into the diaper, making diaper changes just about as easy as with disposables.Not sure if they would be as superior with a different type of cloth diaper, but with our system they're just awesome!WARNING: DO NOT FLUSH THESE IF YOU HAVE AN OLDER HOUSE WITH CONCRETE, CAST IRON OR CEMENT SEWER LINE. THEY WILL CLOG THE SYSTEM. I would say this of any of the ""flushable"" liners. Really, why put anything into the water waste system that you don't have to, because it just has to be removed at the sanitation plant anyway. We just use a regular (diaper dekor) pail for the liners.",1
nothing really special here.  &#34;simple is as simple does&#34; and simple works well to entertain babies.  good price for simple entertainment.,1
"I used this kit to make prints of the paws of my parents' precious dog. She was the star of our family, and although she has since passed on, we still have the impressions of her sweet paws--the paws we loved to hold and kiss and caress. And unlike most dogs, she allowed this. Molly was an angel in life, as she is now for eternity.",1
I only use water because its still messy but for a baby who thinks they need to drink from a cup it works out really nice!,1
I bought one of these for my daughter when she was one. She could se it straight away thanks to the weighted straw. She is now almost 4 and she STILL asks to drink out of this cup every day. I've just bought one for my almost 1 year old son because all he ever wants is his sister's lollacup. Excellent product. Well worth the money.,1
"The first time I washed these (before they were ever used) they melted in the dryer.  Admittedly, the dryer was on high and the label says dry on low -- but who needs a special-care laundry item that's going to get pooped on???",0
Well i thought this was a bouncer.  But it turnes out it wasnt.  I wasn't happy at first but than I put my 7 wk old in it and HE LOVES TO ROCK.  He hates his swing so he coos every time i put him in it he also smiles!!!  He also loves the vibrations!!  My 2 yr old also loves to sit in it and play!  So i got something they both can use!,1
"I did post the question prior to buying if it fit an elongated toilet seat.Someone answered saying yes it does.While I does fit, it really is a semi-fit. It easily falls off the back of the toilet, which causes my toddler to almost fall into the toilet. You have to be very precise in how it mounts, and your child CANNOT move around to much.I would not suggest this seat for anyone who has an elongated toilet.",0
"I really love this sleep sack. I love that I don't have to worry about my little girl. She is 2 and it isn't about safety anymore, but more about keeping warm. As a toddler is is always kicking off her blankets. The Big kid sleep sack is perfect for her. She loves it because it's soft and it breaths. The best part is she can wear it while still running around with her brother and sister. I did find that they ran a bit large in sizing, but that was find with me.It just means she can wear it longer. My 5 year old son was able to fit in it as well.",1
"Excited and anxious...these will go with every outfit for sure!!  No, problems with delivery; package small enough to fit in mailbox and came within the delivery time promised.Go Boilers!!",1
"It fits perfectly in my Chicco Lullaby LX Playpen/Bassinet.  I've tried a few different sheets and all of them were so loose they made me worry my baby would pull them off.  This is exactly what I was looking for soft and a perfect/snug fit.  Hopefully they'll last through many washes, if not it's really cheap and well worth it even if it only lasts a couple of months.",1
"Easy to Assemble...took me (1 person) about 50 minutes to assemble.  Beautiful...looks great with my rosewood stained kitchen cabinets and green marble countertops.  The one problem I have encountered is that it collapses easy, but doesn't want to lock in the closed position.",1
"I can't say enough on how happy I am thirsties came up with a snapping cover. My trusty velcro covers were falling apart and looking YUCKY. I was almost ready to give up on thirsties... and then my snapping cover!!! I LOVE these. I've been using them now for over a month. They are wonderful. If you can sew, look up Rita Rump's free diaper design, I made about 20 diapers with this design and they work PERFECT under this cover. LOVE THEM. THANK YOU THIRSTIES FOR GIVING ME SNAPS!!!",1
"It does help cushion the arm because I am always carrying her carseat over my forearm.  It definitely does the job of cushioning it.  However, it does move easily, but once you have it on and the seat is weighing, it will stay put.  I would recommend it to anyone who carries their carseat over their arm!",0
"My son loves, loves, loves this booster seat.  He now sits ""AT"" the table with the whole family and feels more included.  It is an added plus that he is safe and secure in the seat with no worries of him sliding out of his seat or tipping over.  He is 14months old now.",1
We got this in today and so far my fianc&eacute; loves it. It is really big! I has a lot of space for anything baby and mommy. It comes with a really nice changing pad. The bottle holder is relatively small in my opinion but it has been a while since I've even seen a baby bottle so I'm not the one to judge it. It feels like it is really high quality and will last many years! Our baby is due December 14th so we haven't actually put it to the test yet but we're anxiously waiting. I would recommend it. It's a good price and seems like a great buy.,1
"These are 6 layers thick and take forever to dry! I also bought the joey-bunz PREMIUM large inserts, those are also 6 layers thick but are actually two 3-layer petals sewn together for better washing and drying. I highly recommend the premium inserts over these, they are worth the extra $2",1
Holds A LOT of stuff. Love that they break down easily for moving or storing. Sturdy material.,1
"We have tried many sit and stand stroller, this stroller is by far the best.  It is made well, manuevers well, my kids (1 & 3.5) are very comfortable riding in the stroller, and it has a lot of storage options (basket, drink holder, etc).  We use this allll the time!  In addition to being a superior product, the company Joovy is wonderful.  My stroller had a little tear in the foam.  I contacted Joovy and they immediately called me back and sent a replacement, for free.  Through my conversation with the Joovy Employee, I found out that Joovy is a small family owned business.  I LOVE that the product is fabulous, the customer service is amazing, and that I am supporting a small company.  If you're thinking about a sit and stand style stroller -- This one is awesome!",1
"This is a cute book and very comprehensive with pages for footprints and sonogram pictures etc.  The content is nice.  I think the balance between focus on the first year and then 1-5 is perfect.  It's probably about 1/2 devoted to first year, which I think is about right.  I'm definitely not going to have the motivation to update every month when she's 2 or 3 as I will when she's still an infant.I had to knock it down to 3 stars for two main reasons:1. The pages rip easily when you turn them.  The pages are stiff and the rings are such that even gentle turning of the pages can rip it at the holes.  Sure, better to have stuff pages than flimsy ones, but then figure out what to do with the rings, because this just doesn't work.  I will have to reinforce every page for sure or it will be shredded before baby is a year old2. Much of the advantage of having it be a ring binder is lost by the pairing of unrelated content on two sides of the same page.  If you aren't a traditional happily married mother-father household, then you will have to choose between keeping a page that presents a mommy and daddy happily together, but that on the other side talks about maternal grandparents.  I do recognize that this isn't an issue for many/most people, but it is a shame, since one of the reasons to get a binder rather than a bound book is to remove pages that aren't applicable to you.  There are many children born into nontraditional households.  If you are one of those families, you may want to think twice about this, not that there are many other options.In sum: If you don't mind reinforcing all the pages up front, and if you are a traditional happily married mommy-daddy household, then this is a nice baby book.",0
"As soon as I opened this package, the smell of chemicals hit me. After removing the sheet from the package, lint and dust started accumulating on the floor. I immediately put it back in the package and returned it. A big mistake to buy.",0
"After pumping with these for a few months I started using a rented hospital grade pump that came with genuine Medela parts and I'll never go back. Spend the extra money and get the real thing. It's more gentle, the suction is better, it's quieter, and it's much easier to swap out the breast shields if you find you need a different size. The placement of the suction is different (at the bottom vs the top of the shield) and I think this makes a big difference",0
Bought this for my 3 year old and he likes wearing these belts! He especially likes the spider web design because it reminds him of Spider-man!,1
happy child,1
Just received this piece of furniture and I put it together.  It doesn't look like the one with the woman sitting on her glider chair.  It is extremely short for a changing table.  It would work for someone really short..I would say about 3ft! Now I have to return it because it will not do for a changing table.  It is only cute for a storage for a child.,0
My daughter loves the convience of having the ability of going from car to stroller and back again without taking the baby in and out all the time.,1
"We love these cups, and the smaller version with the handles, it is a great transition cup form the bottle. My 17 month old son loves the soft spout. However once he figured out that he can poke his finger through the breathing hole on the top and flip it over and squeeze all the liquid out, that was the end of this cup, now I am stuck with cleaning up a mess every time.I gave it three stars because overall this is a good cup, it is user issues more than anything we are having, still I want a cup that is leak proof so when I leave my son in the crib with it he won't make a mess! Can't do that with this cup!UPDATE: he stopped pokin his fingers through, so now these work great!",0
"This has become one of our most used baby items.  We can always count on crystal clear sound wherever we take the remote unit in the house or around the yard.  It is very sensitive so it picks up the most subtle sounds.  My favorite feature is the temperature alarm so we know if the room gets too hot.  Did you know: according to medical experts, the ideal sleeping temperature is 62-68 degrees F since the body temperature drop during the cooler night triggers sleepiness.  This baby monitor alerts us if the room ever gets into the 80s, which would maker it harder for our baby to fall asleep.",1
"My babies and I love Avent bottles. My 2yo had a different nipple design than what I'm using for my newborn now. They hold up pretty well (no tearing, discoloration, etc.). They also did away with the extra piece that kept the milk from spilling out. Which is a great thing! This bottle's new design doesn't even need that. Also, my breastfed baby has no issue going from Avent bottle nipple to breast (same is true for 2yo)- which is incredible important to a breastfeeding mom. All in all, its a cute bottle that works for me and baby.",1
This swaddle is perfect for summers in TX. My granddaughter was a wiggler from age of 2 weeks and no traditional swaddling blanket would stay put.  This swaddle works and is easy to put on her.  The velcro tabs at the top of the swaddle keep her arms secure and the pocket on the lower part of the swaddle keeps her legs from popping out of the swaddle.  Wish I had invented this swaddle.  Only thing that is a tiny problem is that the Velcro tabs are loud when releasing them so be sure to change your baby's diaper before using the swaddle for nighttime wear.,1
Love it love it! It even comes in a reclosable plastic pouch to keep them together or to travel. Easy to wash in the dishwasher or by hand. Nice price too.,1
"It is a big surprize to me that this works as advertized, we have found it to be quick, easy, and reliable for the month or so we have had it, making many measurements to get onto its performance.But....WHY make the package of such nonredeemable materials! It's a hard plastic that our recycling center won't take, and it's a struggle to open.  I actually injured myself struggling with the sharp edges that formed when I tried to cut the package open...and then it was useless as a storage container for the device, which is too tall for the shelf of our medicine cabinet.Great product, would have been a five star if it were not so inconsiderately packaged.",1
"Thank you for creating something breathable, washable, microwavable and freezable to ease new breastfeeding woes! I love that this product is natural and created by a mom running a small business.",1
i love it when it arrived I was also exited but my husband couldn't screw it in with out damaging our cabinets. So we decided just to stick them with the glue pads that came with the package but of curse they didn't last. the only reason why i gave it a 4 stars. I would defiantly recommend this!!,1
"We purchased one but after our five month old's legs and feet started turning blue from loss of circulation, we won't be using it.  He's in the fiftieth percentile for weight and height so he is an average sized child.",0
This is a great addition to our one bedroom for the grand daughter. It is quite simple to set up and will no doubt work as our home crib for a year.,1
"My baby loved her frog and now her Dragon. We took them both to the Houston Renaissance Festival and everyone loved it!Well made and exactly the colors shown. It is easy for her to grab the little feet and is easy to find at night when you are randomly groping in a crib for a pacifier. If you feel the soft happiness, it's your wubbanub. It's small enough that I don't have to worry about it smothering her and perfect for travel. Way easier to find than a normal pacifier.I love them so much, I am getting them for my friends with small babies for Christmas.",1
"Beautiful chandelier for the price. Great for a cottagey feel or a young girls room. I had some trouble with damaged crystals on mine but the company was fabulous and they promptly took care of the issue. Actually put mine in the bathroom - put up white wainscotting about 48&#34; high, painted all the trim and cabinets white, painted the walls a Light French Gray (Sherwin Williams), put up the Crystorama wall sconces gotten from overstock and this chandelier from Amazon. So beautiful and cottagey. Love it!!!",1
These toys are great for baby exploration and the like but they have a big flaw(in my opinion):they all pick a  LOT of lint and I have to continuously get it off of the toys. I do not like that but my son seems not to care about it.,0
My baby had a hard time latching on in the beginning. She was premature and didn't quite understand how to latch on and suck successfully. She lost 20% of her birth weight in the first 3 days home and I was worried I wouldn't be able to keep breastfeeding her. We went to a lactation consultant and she suggested these nipple shields. They worked wonders. My baby only had to use the shields for a week or so until it became natural. I would have given up on breast feeding if it wasn't for these shields. These also help with sore nipples.,1
"This strap works  as expected. If you secure it properly around the child's waist it will not slip down and trip the child. I had no problems with it and my l5 -month old, who loves to explore, resisted at first, but as soon as he realized he could still explore while I was holding onto him he didn't mind it. Recommend it!",1
"We bought this to help us keep track of our toddler at the airport. The seam on the backpack harness fell apart within an hour of use. Great idea, lousy quality.",0
"I'm not sure how these hold up as diapers, but they are the best burp cloths - hands down. They are super soft and absorbent. They are just as good, if not better, than the Aden + Anais burpie bibs (which I LOVE).",1
Great product! My little boy loves the bright colors & crawling around on it!!! It is easy to put away & clean up!,1
"This is such a lifesaver. When my son started crawling, we couldn't take our eyes off of him, he was everywhere. This play pen enables me to get some cleaning done around the house while he's content playing with his toys. It also allows me to keep decorative things on our sofa table with out having to worry about him getting to anything. It's very durable, I like that its made of plastic so that as soon as summer hits, we'll be able to take this outside. It's very easy to keep clean, I just wipe it down with some disinfecting wipes, let it dry and he's good to go. Not the most fashionable piece of baby gear to have in your living room but it does it's job. Sometimes the music is annoying, if a toy is leaned or pushed up against the piano keys, the music continuously plays until you move the toy. I think his favorite thing is the phone, he carries it everywhere. I suggest replacing the batteries as soon as you receive it, when they start dying the music gets pretty creepy. Definitely a great purchase. If I had room I'd purchase another one to extend it.",1
"The spray doesn't spay in a mist.  It comes out in streaks, and this goes for both cans I ordered",0
"My husband saw this after my first shower and said ""What's that thing for?""  He now loves it.  I do too.  Best of all, you don't have to buy specific bags, we use the bags from the grocery and they do quite well.  We've bought some air freshener cans and put them in the bottom, because after 8 months of use, it's going to smell.  But the room does not carry the smell, only when you're on the floor near the genie.  My only issue is that I've broken a nail or two lifting the latch to get the top open.  But it's infinitely better than having the smell!!",1
"The 30.5mm flanges were not as big as the 30mm Medela flanges. Not sure why. They worked well enough, though!",1
"The Jeep umbrella stroller is a great value for the price. It is lightweight yet sturdy, and folds up nicely for when you need to get it in the car or for when you are storing it away.  The stroller rides smoothly and has wheel locks when you need it to stay put. Nice feature is the window at top so you can see inside with having to bend down and look in. This looks stylish without being overbearing and has essential ameneties like a cup holder, side pocket, and storage under the seat because you are going to need it unless you want to carry a backpack everywhere you go. You need to decide whether you want a heavier type model or lighter type to suit your location--there's no one size fits all when it comes to stroller. For this weight class and size it's quite good. Hope this review helps a little in making your decision.",1
"We bought this for long car trips right before we started potty training our son.  As it turns out, we use it more around town than for long trips.  I love that I always have a CLEAN toilet ready for my son.  I usually just open up the back of the van and he sits back there on the toilet.  The carrying case is wonderful too, very sturdy, well made, with extra storage for supplies.It is very easy to use and sturdy.  My son has never had a problem with it and it gives me piece of mind.",1
"These are the perfect valance for a little girls room! Good price, perfect light pink color, matches most pink room decors. Very pleased",1
"It was a gift for our granddaughter.  She is very pleased with it, so far.  She is expecting in June.  The only problem was how hard it was to assemble.  Our grandson and I worked for an hour to get it set up.",1
Bought these as a gift for my daughter and couldn't be happpier.  Nice bright cololrs and soft makes it child friendly.,1
"Works great, now I can take my grand baby everywhere! It took like two seconds for the police officer to install....",1
These are great to reduce a mess.  I bought a bunch and always have one handy.  I highly recommend these for busy moms.,1
There is a lot of static no mater where you are. I do not recomend this item.  I am not really sure why I even bought it unless I was going for price.  I know I wanted a 2 speaker system but I usually read reviews before I buy anything and this one I must have missed! I am not a happy camper but am really glad I didn't spend a lot on this item.,0
These knobs are very easy to install.  Once you have them in place they are easy to use as well.  They are bulky or hard to use like other child safety products out there.  I have large knobs on my stove and these are able to cover them which is great!,1
"The snail itself is heavy, and the rings are pretty uneventful when you try to play with them individually and not 'stacking' them...Also they can't be stacked out of order, which limits baby's creativity....She likes to suck on the eyeballs and the flower, that's why I gave it 3 stars.",0
"My lil one has Cerebral Palsy and this was a great everywhere chair!  She actually got to pass this chair on to her Kindergarten classmate and after washing the covers, it looked new again. Durable, folds up great and lightweight!",1
"I was hoping this product would be the same quality level as our brand new Dot Stroller. Sadly not:1) D-ring that supports carry strap broke on first use. not so good when your traveling through an airport with two kids in tow.2) We have the accessory kit to add a second eat but when you pack this in with stroller, you can't roll the stroller which makes the first issue even worse.3) we found materials to be sub-par. Already showing signs of wear after one trip.4) zipper is very flimsy for such a tight fitting back and broke also.So sadly, not up to Phil & Ted usual standards. You'd be better off with a generic aftermarket case (and a lot cheaper too)",0
"My son, 1, loves to drink out of regular cups more than most of sippy cups so when I seen these I just had to try. Verdict was..he loved then!",1
"I had problems to nurse my baby during the first days because I didn't have enough milk and I had to complement her feeding with formula. So I rented a Medela breast pump from my local hospital to keep my milk production and ordering the double pumping kit I reduced the pumping time in 50%. Excellent option for moms that want to breastfeed the baby and need to use the bottle at the same time.""""",1
"I was expecting these to be just stickers that I bought on a whim and could maybe use on my sons paperwork at preschool etc.  they are much more. Vivid colors, durable maybe even waterproof fabric they stuck well to his fabric pouches where I put his epipens etc. I have found them very useful",1
"I bought this for my infant daughter and she really likes it. It's not soft and cuddly like her other stuffed animals, but it stands up on its legs, which she likes, and the legs are long enough for her to grab onto and drag it around. It's well-made and very cute.",1
"It's hard to buy for a 5 mth old,but this seems to fit for a little one.It's soft and has lot's of places to hold onto for little hands.Soft sounds and colorful.I think he will enjoy.",1
We use this daily while our newborn sleeps in our room at night. I find it very durable though the mobile isn't very secure and will fall off most times if it's bumped by a hand or arm when picking your infant up. I also find the diaper holder easier for use inside the pack n play outside diapers seem to fall out on the floor but for a basic pack n pay I love it and the bassinet is great,1
"This gate is awesome!  Easy to install, great quality, very versatile.  Right now we have it in our hallway to keep our 21/2 year old contained and so far, he hasn't scaled it or figured out how to open the swing gate.  Wish I'd bought it earlier!!",1
"I thought that this would be the greatest addition to my nursery.  I was completely wrong.  If you don't put the diaper into the unit correctly, you can forget it working properly.  Sticking your hand half way down and trying to get it to seal was completely fustrating. After three months, I threw it in the trash.  I found the Diaper Champ to be a great addition and an end to my fustration.",0
Ended up returning this item. I was expecting to receive 9 pieces according to how the item is worded but instead only received 3. Warning: you're buying 3 nipples for $19.74 not 9 nipples.On a side note...dr. Brown bottles/nipples are awesome.,0
"I had this item on my baby registry and was given the item at my baby shower. We had several people by the base and since I had two many I wanted to send the item back for a credit. I emailed Chapin through Amazon and was told to send the item back for a full credit minus the shipping. I paid to ship the item back to Chapin but a month later I still did not have the credit. I emailed Chapin several times and got no answer so I emailed Amazon. Amazon tells me that Chapin put the money on the gift givers credit card and there is nothing I can do about my gift. I am not fighting with Amazon and Chapin because I have the email from Chapin telling me I would be the one to get a credit. Not only am I disappointed in Amazon and will have to think hard about ordering anything else from them, I would never buy anything else from Chapin.The seat and base are wonderful but I would never by it from this company.",0
"My daughter got these when she was 9 months old and they instantly became her favorite toy, so we bought a 2nd set. Now that she is 16 months old she still loves them, but we stack them, use them as water toys (they have different shapes of holes on the bottom of each one) and pretend drink from them! Great toy to grow with",1
"This is an excellent tub for new parents. It can be used for infants and does not need to be discarded after a few months since it can hold children up to 24 months. Although it seemed large when it came in the box, it is perfect even for use in a small apartment - it is sturdy andcan be put on a counter as needed then hung on a door or in a closet forstorage.",1
"This gift is for christmas, one of my grandsons' presents. I know he will enjoy this gift to the fulliest, at least for the next few years or until he out grow it.",1
This is a fun toy for my 11 month old son.  He enjoys trying to scoop the waterbugs into the net.  The net also serves as an easy way for me to scoop up all my son's bath toys when he is finished bathing.,1
"These are great for putting on the side of my stroller that is facing traffic when I am walking in the evenings, but when my 4 year old (who is oblivious to his surrounding about half the time) is biking with us, I strap them to his handle bar and the bar under his seat so that drivers can see him better with the eye catching blinks.  It makes me feel better to make him more visible to them and that makes it a win in my book to keep him safer.",1
Took the doors off my daughters closet and used these curtains. Love them.,1
"My baby hates this towel. Passionately. It doesn't come out soft when line dried even with softener. We ended us using &#34;mummy and daddy&#34; towels. The wash cloths work ok on us - again, baby hates. Maybe it's better with a dryer, but I can only rate what I experience.",0
"So cheap, so durable, so perfect, so easy. It was worth every penny. I used it with my cosco Scerena and Tumi bag. We did not even bring a stroller. This was perfect. She loved riding in it. I almost bought an$80 one and so glad i didn't. We wouldnt had enough hands to pull everything. Highly recommend it!",1
"With a grandchild just starting to crawl, we are busily baby proofing our home so we were eager to test this gate. Listed below are details about  safety features, ease of use and installation, appearance, etc.We used it with and without the extensions, on various doors in our house, so I could compare how easy it was to use in different areas. It worked perfectly on each of 3 doors we tested. We are leaving it up to see how it holds up with frequent use so I'll provide updates - if needed.Please note: we did not use the permanent installation option, with the enclosed screws and hardware, but used the non-permanent mount system. As our grandchild gets older, we can take this down without any holes remaining in our wall from screws, etc.Ease of installation without the extension: all directions shown through illustrations alone. There are no words. However, there is both an 800 number as well as a website for further help, if needed. I checked out both and will give info about those later.This gate does not use a tension or spring mount so it takes a bit longer to put in place than those...but really, no big deal. We used the enclosed wrench to tighten the bolts and end pieces for the gate - and that was that. Once in place,it doesn't get knocked off the wall,and opens quickly and easily. This is a major plus to use. Entering and leaving a room through a balky gate is frustrating.Ease of use: We have normal strength, nothing special, and find it a snap to open this gate. To do so, you have to simply press a button, squeezing on both sides of the gate, easily accomplished with only one hand. Then you gently push down on the handle and the gate simply swings open. It all happens quickly. A baby or even toddler should not be able to open the gate, though, because of the 2 step process and squeezing the required button - while simple for the average adult - should be tricky for a baby or toddler. When the grandchild isn't around, we leave the gate open. It stays firmly in place on the wall.Okay, now for ease of installation with the extension- this was a bit trickier and I wish the instructions were clearer about having to remove some end pieces from the in order to add the rest of the hardware and put the gate in place. We did figure it out, though. Again, we found the gate easy to open and are continuing to test it.Appearance and safety: I have a black and white kitchen so the white gate blends in nicely. It has nice lines and should blend with a variety of room styles. Can't imagine a baby or even toddler opening this easily. And the lower threshold has prevented us from tripping - at least, so far, compared to other baby gates we've had. Nice feature!Some reviewers indicated that this gate opened easier in one direction than another. Maybe we were lucky but we haven't had that issue. We can open it quickly in either direction.There is an optional lock at the bottom of the gate. I think this is to ensure the gate opens in only one direction (not really sure). We aren't using this option.We didn't use this on doorways larger than 35"".Here's some info on 800 number and websites (2 included in the instruction brochure) if you need extra help installing the gate. I called the number and looked at the info on the website. If I'd had problems with installation (and I didn't) they would have been helpful. There is an online video which is very informative but the person answering the phone was willing to help as well. The website was a tiny bit quicker.We are very pleased with this gate. Please feel free to ask any questions if you need more info, using the comments section below and I'll try to provide more details.",1
"I have this car seat for a year and its still going strong. Two weeks after I brought it we got into a car accident, where the other car ram us into a building. My daughter loves siting in the middle, if she did have this car seat that day&#8230; I thank god I brought it when I did. Nice design and tough. Its a little hard on the bottom but most car seats are for way more money. As a cheap mom this is a must have item.",1
"We started using this bed rail for each side of her bed (don't forget to order TWO- it only comes with one) since she left the crib. We believe this has saved her from falling countless times. She is old enough now to even tell us so. She doesn't want them off, even though it makes climing in and out of bed more of a hassle for her. Excellent product at an excellent price!",1
"This Bumper is awesome! I was worried about it slipping around under the sheets, but my daughter has bounced against it for three days and it hasn't budged. Love it!",1
"I exclusevely breastfeed my baby and work full time. I pump 3 times at work to make what she needs for daycare the next day. she only breastfeeds once a day (in the morning), other than that she won't latch because she's so used to the bottle. Last week i called the company and they had great customer service, my pump was having some malfunctions so they said they would mail me a new one right away. well, today my pump died while i was pumping at work. Thank god i have a freezer stash otherwise i'd be out of luck! but still no pump in the mail so i dont know what to do :/... by the way i've only been using the pump for about 2 months.",0
Exactly what we needed to get the stuffed animals off the floor! We have one in each of the kids rooms.,1
"Buy 2 packs. You'll need them. I have these guys in my sons room, my room, the living room, our car, the diaper bag, and one in the car seat for good luck. Spit up happens. These soak it right up. Easy to clean. Can never have too many!",1
"I'm glad I bought only one of these to try out.I'm not going to buy more. What irritates me most is: takes SO LONG to dry.The cotton inserts, that you can't take out are sloppy somewhat and often my 14 month old baby girl ends up with the plasticy cover touching her skin instead of organic cotton. With only peeing it still can pass some critique, but if the poop gets into it, it gets lost among ll the layers and is hard to wash out.I'm devoted cloth diaper user with a 3rd child and I wish I could say something really positive about this diaper.",0
Great product.  It fits in the crib and pack n play. I have one for home and one for daycare.,1
"These are great as burp cloths! (I actually would like it if they were a little bit larger though)  I bought one package, but ended up coming back and buying 2 more. If you are buying for a first child, you just will not believe how many burp cloths you'll go through every day - stock up now!",1
"I needed to find something for my newborn son to sleep in as I didn't want to put him in his big crib yet. I saw this at a local store and it is adorable, plush and all sorts of sounds, etc. I ended up ordering it from Amazon as it was much cheaper than in the store. Everything works perfect, but holy cow the motor that runs the cradle swing is LOUD, not a low hum or something white noise-ish, but obnoxiously noisy. I put the Snugabunny in our bedroom near my bed and I can't sleep with the swing on! It also swings a little fast (even on the lowest setting) for my newborn. On the positive side, the mobile is super cute and the music is nice also. My little guy does sleep in it pretty well, just not with the swing going. I probably would have still purchased it again, but if you're looking for something for baby to sleep in and you're sensitive to sound, this thing will drive you crazy! During the day it's no big deal though.",1
"He was unable to breast feed properly. We bottle fed from about 3-4 weeks (dropper fed until then, except for the first couple days of trying to nurse him).Our baby isn't fussy so I can't judge whether or not he'd like other bottles.We have an assortment of Born Free bottles - started with 2, added 2 more, then finally a 6 pack.We have pretty consistent problems with leaking. It may be that the different gaskets have different tolerances. Some fit into the white piece very easily, almost dropping in. Others require some pressure so they seat.I think the bottle manufacturer knows about the leaking problem - they even say that if the bottle leaks you tightened it too much. This should dissuade most people from questioning the actual bottle, directing doubt to the end user. I have a rudimentary understanding of torque, assembly, etc - I've successfully assembled car engines, regularly fix things that require a balance of torque and tightness (plumbing stuff for example), and install relatively fragile (and torque limited) carbon fiber parts.However, after a lot of experimenting, I can't figure out what causes the bottles to leak. Loose gaskets, tight gaskets, change nipples (there seems to be two shapes, one with a flared base, one with a squared off base, and I think they're not supposed to be different), the bottles still randomly leak.So this morning our son had two bottles, 6 ounces at first, another 4 ounces later. Both bottles leaked enough that I used a burp cloth each (cloth diaper) to absorb the leaked formula, and his onesie is soaked for about a 3-4"" radius below his chin.As my wife said, ""Honey, they just leak."" Bottles shouldn't leak. It's a basic premise for having a closed system.I'd recommend looking at other bottles.",0
"We had our first baby and we were so excited to buy her a crib. Unfortunately the standard crib these days pretty much fill in your room. Honestly I did not have that size room. 3 weeks into her life she sleeps on this everyday and so far so comfortable. I am hoping to use this at least until 3 months Beyond which I doubt this will be of any use. So if you really want a space saver and money saver this is a good buy.PS: I have not used this for long, so not sure what happens when my baby outgrows.",1
"I bought this car seat for my grand daughter, who is 2 years old. I had such a difficult time locking and unlocking the buckles that I had to switch it with the one my 6'4&#34; son in law uses. He said, that he could manage it, but it is not easy to deal with those buckles. Also, the latch on the seat is too close, making it very tight for the baby and ackward to snap in.",0
I have used these bottles since I had my first child 19 years ago I have tried others but I always go back to what worked the best!!! And with expecting again I want what has always been quality for me. Other bottles are higher priced but 1 thing I learned more expensive doesn't mean better. And the newer fashioned bottles have parents scared with the BPA these are just perfect.,1
Our old monitor broke and I was dreading finding a new one. This one was relatively cheap and had good reviews! So we took the chance and ordered it. We live in a 2 story townhouse. The range is amazing. I can take it to my neighbors & sit on their couch & still see her. The old monitor we had didn't make it out the front door.The screen is great- colorful & clear and the infared at night is awesome!! For the price & quality this monitor rocks!,1
"It's a great carseat except one big flaw. The buckle is so difficult to unclick that I believe it is a safety hazard. If I'm in an accident and someone else needs to remove my child from the car because I am injured, I don't believe another person could figure out how to unbuckle it. After two years of use, I followed another poster's advice and push both thumbs HARD against the top of the red button. This is the ONLY way I can unbuckle it. Now in an urgent situation, how is someone else supposed to figure that out? I requested another buckle when the one it came with became even MORE difficult to unbuckle after time. The company was very nice and efficient at sending me a new one, but they sent me the SAME buckle. It's such a nice, expensive seat from such a great company; how can they not fix this one tiny piece on an otherwise excellent carseat?Great carseat otherwise. Comfortable for my child, well cushioned, looks great, we value the harness for our son when he was 4 and now is 5. I",0
"These are a little tricky to get the perfect fit at first, but the best thing about them are the inserts and the soft outer cover.  No leaks yet with these.  I prefer the Kawaii to Fuzzibunz Elite. These have more snaap options to get the legs just right.",1
This is a great diaper bag easy to use and attaches well to my Ergo baby carrier but I took one star away because the lining on the inside at the top ripped at the seam and I haven't even put anything heavy in it yet all in all a great bag but for the price it should be a bit more sturdy UPDATE the lining on the inside is crap this bag is completly falling apart after only a few months of use im so upset cause the design is great its just cheaply made,1
"I bought this as a replacement filter, and it works exactly as I expected it to.  that's all I have to say.",1
"got this on sale for around $25. does the job, the music is a nice touch, easy to assemble. at this price it's a good deal. any higher i would shop around.",0
"I bought this it because the 2nd pictures show glow in the dark so cool. Amazon should remove that picture. Be aware to new buyer, it only glow the edge of butterfly only ""green color"" NOT the whole butterfly like it show on the 2nd picture. The picture trick you that they use the NEON bulb to glow in the dark. Do not buy this sticker.",0
"I love this crib.  I too was nervous about purchasing a crib I hadn't seen in person, but it is lovely.  The detail is nice, and it was simple to put together.  I wish it came with caps to cover the screw holes in the front but that would not be enough to keep me from purchasing the crib again.  For its price, it is a wonderful purchase.  Now, I just need to patiently wait out the next five weeks to put my baby girl in there!",1
"We bought 3 more!  Dont waste your money on something else just because it looks all cute with fancy print.  This band will be able to be used for months if not years.  sizing is adjustable and heat pack really nice option we used it at first and it really helped.  He now sleeps better and is not fussy we use the band daily,  I will be buying these as baby shower gifts from now on.. Life saver for us.",1
"I like the idea of this camera, but it has to be very close to your child at night to be able to see anything. we wanted to use it to make sure a 12-18 mo old was ok at night and not crawling out of bed, can not put it close enough to see her.",0
The nature sounds option on the mobile is great to set and play when I lay my baby down to sleep. It is totally helpful for putting her back to sleep as well if she awakes too. The auto shutoff option after 20min is great for preserving battery life as well. The projection mobile viewer keeps my baby entertained so I can place her in her crib with this on to get some things done. Well worth buying and a great product.,1
"I purchased this months ago in preparation for needing it when my baby girl was born this summer. I went to connect the pieces yesterday so that my husband could use the carrier and the extension doesn't click securely into the existing clasps, rendering it completely useless.",0
I felt very strange when I got a email which told me that this item was undeliverable with no reason. I got refund for this purchase. It wasted my time to buy this item.,0
"My baby is 5 months old and for about 3 months I have been using this as a sound monitor. Unless her room is completely lit up the video does not work AT ALL (in the handheld or the monitor). The sound is still working, but the static is ridiculous. Overall DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY> when I tried to contact the company directly they said unless I had a receipt the wouldn't exchange, and that they would offer me a discount. NO S(&^! you're offering a discount! it's $350! DO NOT BUY.",0
It only took a couple of days for my 2 year old to figure it out.  within a week he was staying in bed all night--even with Mommy getting up with new baby sister.I only with is was not quite so bright.,1
This is the nicest gate I have ever bought. Easy to assemble and durable. Looks nice and is easy to open. Very high quality.,1
"I have never written a review before, but after reading all the bad reviews this monitor has gotton, I had to write one.First, the sound is crystal clear, I can hear my baby breathing at night, and her monitor is across the room.Second, yes my monitor may beep in the middle of the night, but it's NOT the parent unit finder...it's the motion detector.  That's why I bought this monitor.  It picks up if one of the animals goes into the babies room.  It will also pick up baby movement once the baby starts moving more, but you CAN turn the motion detector off.This monitor does EXACTLY what it is suppose to do!  I love it!",1
"So excited to find the safe sippy! cute design! rubber grip!leaks. leaks badly. leaves a puddle anywhere it happens to be tipped over on it's side. leaks when my child tilts it toward him and misses his mouth. leaks if he is holding it and turns around fast in a circle.leaks, leaks, leaks.",0
"The quality of the product is great, but I wish the color was more true to the name. The color is more of a walnut, dark brown color. It works but, the color isn't very accurate.",1
"The stroller was easy to  assemble and light weight. The hub caps for  2 wheels were not in the box, I emailed the company and received a response within a half hour. Two days later, the hub caps arrived. I bought the stroller for visiting family members. I love the storage space and had no problems pushing a 3 year old in the the stroller  on various surfaces. I looked at other strollers here in NYC and they were more expensive. Good value for the money.",1
"Our master bedroom is on the main floor of our home while our son sleeps upstairs.  During his first two months, he slept beside me in his bassinet.  I would practically sleep with my hand in the bassinet.  Many nights I would sleep sitting up with the baby in my arms.  When we decided to move him upstairs, we purchased the Summer Video Monitor to supplement the audio monitor that we already had.  That was the best decision ever.  Although the picture is not crystal clear, we are able to see if he is awake or we can watch his little stomach rise and fall as he breathes.  Also, the audio component is so sensitive that we can hear the slightest change in his breathing pattern.  We no longer need the other monitor.  I definitely recommend this product to others.",1
"Great product!  I have several Taggie brand things for my 7 month old little girl and she just loves them.  This is the perfect cart cover and it's a little big for the high chairs, but works well, nonetheless, with keeping her clean and entertained.  I especially like that the lap strap covers most of her belly, which keeps her more secure in the cart or high chair.  Well done, Taggies!",1
These are toooo cute! They hold up really well in the wash and look so darn cute on my little girl.,1
I bought this on vacation when I forgot to bring my daughters nasal aspirator ( the good ones from the hospital). It didn't work at first and then I realized the little gray ring inside the hard plastic part was crinkling up causing the suction to fail. After a quick fix it was like a Hoover for her nose! We don't much like the music but my daughter loves seeing how much boogers came out of her little nose. She will literally bring me all the parts so we can get the boogers out :) I am now adding this to our vacation bags along with the one from the hospital. It would be a good idea to buy extra tips just in case one is still drying between uses or you lose one!,1
"I am currently 23 weeks pregnant and at about 18 weeks I started having severe back and hip pain- it would wake me up and I wouldn't be able to stay in bed. I had a body pillow and a regular pillow and I would use them on both sides of my body but they never stayed there or were very supportive. A friend of mine had recommended the candy-cane shaped pillow but I decided to splurge on the leacho back n' belly chic after reading the reviews and I am so glad I did. My back pain is completely gone and the hip pain is really minimal- I just switch sides abotu halfway through the night...no adjusting a bunch of pillows every time I have to get up and pee! I don't feel its too firm or too soft. It is pretty warm but the bedroom is kept cool with the a/c...its probably par the course anyway being pregnant and all. It does take up a lot of room in the bed so no room for hubby :( We have a queen bed, but my sleep is too important, especially since neither one of us will be getting much in 3-4 months. I also don't find the seam around my shoulders to be a problem, I think I sleep low enough down on the pillow. But to feel that supportive contour at my back and support between my knees when I climb in to bed...aaaaahhh heaven!",1
The Little Giraffe blankets have become my gift to every newborn I know. I was originally given one a gift for the arrival of my son and he loved it so much I got one for my daughter as well. Both kids (3 and 1) now still use and love their &#34;little blankies&#34;. I highly recommend these security blankets!,1
"This product is well made, sturdy, attractive and well priced. But the best of this product is the ease of assembly( less than 10 minutes ) and the simplicity of placing it in the car.Also, the cup holders are a great extra feature.My 4 1/2 year old grandson loves this seat.",1
"Our daughter was colicky for a while- and this swing was a lifesaver- Great music and sounds, loved the side to side swinging. only drawback was breaking her of sleeping in it to get her into her crib regularly.",1
"We wanted a fun, colorful mobile for our baby's crib that was not musical or battery powered -- just an old fashioned wood mobile with fun colors.  This completely fit the bill!  It's well made, great vibrant colors and very minimalist.  Perfect!  Would highly recommend it!",1
"This set of 2 is the best price I have found, so I bought 1 for me and 1 for an expecting friend. Daughter loves it! So soft, I like that it's safe plastic and colors. My daughter likes the different parts to help with teething...from the ears to the legs! This is my new go-to for expecting gifts! Only downfall is that dirt/hair sticks to them, but easy to rinse off. I didn't realize at first that they squeaked...but baby loves it!",1
"Great tub, but for the price, I wish it would accommodate a growing baby (e.g. offer a sitting position). Love that fresh water flows into the tub and dirty water washes out, but it does waste quite a bit of water! Also, if you have a bigger baby, the dirty water on the left hand side (side opposite of the drain) may stay inside the tub for a long time because the baby will block it from freely flowing to the other side to the open drain. Unless you drain the water through the plugged drain valve.The beeping noise when the water temp reaches 100 or higher is annoying when the water temp hovers between 99.9 and 100.It also doesn't fit on top of my sink. When I bathed my newborn with the tub on top of my countertop, I noticed the plugged valves don't seal well because there was always TONS of water on my countertop so I have to bathe him in my bathtub.The tub is also bulky so storage is a pain if you don't have storage space for it.",1
"After many months of looking at ring slings and reading reviews, I decided on a Mya Wrap Baby Sling.  The product I recieved was of exceptional quality.  The rings exceeded my expectations.  Unfortunately my baby had a skin reaction to the fabric even after several washings.  In my opinion it was just too rough of a fabric so I contacted the company to tell them the issues I had.  Two separate customer service reps got in contact with me immediately and promised a replacement with sateen cotton.  Even though the product was purchased through amazon, they stood behind their sling and had a courier come and pick up my sling that was causing the problem.  Since the replacement Mya sling was back ordered, they also sent me a competitors sling to use until the replacement was available (also a very high quality ring sling).  All of this was done with no cost to me.  To say the least I was very impressed with the company and how they not only made sure I was happy but made sure my baby was taken care of while I waited for a replacement.  I gave this a four star rating only because the fabric of the sling I purchased was too rough for my baby.  If I could rate the Sateen Cotton Sling it would recieve a five star rating based on durability (this is my second baby in it) and comfort (the padded shoulder is amazing vs. the non padded).  I wear my babies around 6 hours a day and this is my go to sling because of the padding it provides.  My children obviously find it very comfortable since they like to spend so much time in there especially in the newborn stage where they are kept tight and close next to mom.  My two year old will even go and find the sling and request to be carried around in it.  Like any fabric this does stretch a little after a few hours of wearing so you will need to readjust it but I do not find that to be a bother.  The fabric is also high quality in the fact that after several washings, it has not noticeably faded on me yet.  I also enjoy that the pocket has a zipper on it which helps give me confidence that my things will not fall out if I flip the tail up to nurse or do other things.  Overall I would highly recommend this product.",1
"Hands free is SO much better. This hands free pumping bra is not too intrusive or complicated to put on, and it holds things in place where I put them. The openings for the pump heads are more like slits than just plain holes- so it's adjustable for women with different anatomies. It's holding up really well to daily use and multiple washings, and I'm very pleased with it.",1
"This is the first toy that I bought for my child. I am a keen mother. So, I was very picky on what toy would first be submitted to my child. This firefly toy of Lamaze is a great decision that I had made.This is a good take along toy that could provide my child the stimulation and fun that he could possibly have. It has this huge big eye that could take the attention of my kid whenever he cries. The colors are also so vibrant that it could stimulate the vision of my child, as the doctors may say.It has been the constant companion of my child; it could cheer him up whenever he's crying and it would always give fun and enjoyment in his eyes.",1
"I bought these links when i saw it on a reviewer's customer picture as i thought it will be a great play stuff for my baby's play yard, however it did not turn out the way i visualised it. It felt more like bangles/fashion accesories for my girls, lol..... Not a bad product but just did not meet my visualisation",0
"I recently bought my first diaper genie. I was a little reluctant to buy it due to the fact that my kids are 5,4 and 2. The youngest is still in diapers and the other 2 wear pull ups at night. We usually just throw the pull-ups and diapers in the trash in the bathroom. Well the stench was really bad, even though I would throw out the trash very often. My sister just had a baby and received the diaper genie at her baby shower. She loves hers and told me to get one. I read the reviews online and was reluctant like I said. I went to the store and looked at in person, compared it to other pails, ect... I decided to go ahead and buy it and bought the stage 2(toddler) refills to use with it since I would be putting pull-ups and size 6 diapers in it. I love the diaper genie! I wish I had bought it a lot sooner. I have not had any of the problems other people have written in their reviews and neither has my sister(who's baby is a month old). I know I will be using this genie until we are a diaper/pull-up free household.",1
We have been using this car seat for about 3 months now since my son grew out of his infant car seat.  I love almost everything about it.  We also own a Cosco Scenera which we recently used for a trip to Hawaii and I was so happy when we got home and I didn't have to deal with that seat anymore!  Here are the wonderful things about the Britax Boulevard:-It's super cute.-It's super comfortable with lots of padding all over.  My 9 month old falls asleep almost every time he rides in it.-It's easy to fasten and adjust.  I never have to pull out more strap to get it right because of the adjustable design.-It sits at a good angle so that my tall (31&#34;) baby can see out the window and have leg room.-His head doesn't hang forward when he falls asleep like in the cheaper seat.-Very easy to install using the latch system- I like this so much better than having to use a seatbelt.  There is a great video on the Britax website that helps with proper installation too.  I am not great with diagrams and written instructions so I was very thankful for the step-by-step video.-Side impact protection: This seat has wings that come out from the sides to protect the child's head in case of a side-impact collision.  It just seems like common sense that all seats should offer this kind of protection!-You can remove the cover for cleaning without uninstalling the seat-Velcro on the inside walls to keep straps out of the way while you put baby in- I love this feature!I have a short list of cons to consider:-Heavy (but I don't take it in and out of the car- it has stayed in place since installation) so not the best option for air travel-Expensive-Sometimes the loose padding on the seat area can be hard to keep in place- it would be nice if it could attach with Velcro,1
"I bought these bowls after trying about 5 other kinds of ""stay put"" suction bowls.  These are the ONLY ones that have actually STAYED PUT on his high chair, the table, and even restaurant tables!  We went out and bought another pack, so we now have 6.  My 1-year-old pulls and pulls and pulls on these, but cannot break the suction -- a great deal for the money!",1
"This is a pretty little baby book!  There's room for pictures, firsts, etc. and it's got a lot of detailed areas for baby's &#34;firsts&#34;.  The only thing I don't like is that the binding is on the smaller side.  So it's not going to fit the baby's first birthday or holiday cards.  It would be nice to have extra space or a way to add pages but for the price, it's a very pretty book.  I really like it!",1
Brought this for my grandson toput his pacifier in it but he didn't use a pacifier and only use his fingers...,1
This was so perfect for our pack and play to give our child a comfy place to sleep while on vacation. The quality is similar to a regular crib mattress. This paired with the American Baby Company Waterproof Quilted Cotton Portable/Mini Crib Mattress Pad was perfect. For once my child didn't scream to be sleeping in the pack and play. I wish I would have discovered this sooner!,1
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my newborn, but I bought it more for myself. :-P The colors are bright and the fabric is made of various textures. Is it like your typical stuffed toy? Sure, but it's quality, and fun. I put it on the back of the couch so my baby to look at while I feed him, and it really catches his eye. My next item will be the giraffe lovey.",1
"Great for positioning, pocket is awesome, fabric is great, quick release is handy. Overall a fantastic pillow for nursing, best one out there that I can find.",1
"This bag is just perfect! the entire set was well designed, materials are just right, lots of space and it is discreet for those mommys that do not like funny themes on a bag that it is actually for us!",1
"We had an older Jeep stroller with our first son and it lasted through his toddler years and first year of our second son.  It was time to buy another one, and we went with this simpler version.  It is a very compact and an easy to handle stroller.  Highly recommend it!",1
I was very impressed with this seat.  I got it on sale and was axpecting something cheap.  I just needed something quickly for my ever growing twins.  The fabric is very nice and the padding is adequate.  I love the removable bottom liner.  It came in handy when one of my guys got carsick on vacation.,1
"I BOUGHT this because my son Liam is so gassy and he cries all the time due to gas and stomach pain. It really helps because  makes my son baby Liam much more able to handle the pain. The only problem is that the fabric its to warm and thick and if is a hot day, he sweats so bad, but stills ok, because it helps him to sleep due a colic and gas pain....",1
I have purchased several of these belts for my son.  They work great!  I would recommend these to any Mom with young children.,1
The best. I mean the best. Nothing inferior about it. I love it. I think my baby will use this for the next 6yrs or even more!,1
This lady bug was a hit. It has become a regular at bed time and the lights work great! Recommended!,1
I love this. It's exactly what I was looking for chocolate and pink at a great price and good quality.,1
A must have for your baby he will love itthe color doesn't go out A 5 star quality and the baby can hold it easily . I order many other Teether but this is the best one I will order another one as a gift to my friend baby,1
These are just ok. The nipple flow is extremely fast to only be a two. Don't love them but better then the other Avent bottles that you have to piece together -_-,1
"My daughter is 4 months old, and we haven't been able to try these yet because they slide off of her legs too easily.",1
"We are using this now that our son is in his nursery.We bought ours from Target, not amazon.It creates noise on its own, as if someone were tapping on the cameraLast night, it zoomed in on its own at 2:00amCreepy!Anyway, it works but I agree, there is interference periodically and the volume goes out.I wouldn't recommend this product.",0
highly recommendedIt really protects the neck and the shoulders of your babies. The safety belts of the safeseats usually irritates your baby.Good price for a safety item. A must have for any parent using a Safeseat.,1
"These are absolutely adorable tub tatoos!  I have both the fish and the turtle - both are cute and my kids like them.  Unfortunately, they are so small that the do not do a very good job to prevent slipping in the tub (even with two packages of them in the tub).",0
"I bought this because I needed a high chair for my 6 month old son. I have two older kids and know that those big bulky chairs end up more in the way than anything, so I knew I wanted something like this. I love it. It sits up to the table with the rest of our family, so my son feels engaged with the rest of us. It attaches so easily to the chair and clean up is such a breeze! Great product. Highly recommend to anyone.",1
"I'm pleased with this item. The lid seals with no leakage. The only thing I would critic would be that the individual cups are a little small, but my little one loves it and so do her teachers at her daycare.",1
"The first thing that impressed me about this sippy cup was that the valve was not in the spout so my son was not able to chew it and ruin the cup. I also liked that it is a pretty light weight cup even though it is made of metal, and the thermos aspect is great as well. The first couple of times that he used it the cup worked really well so I went and bought a second one. Within a week both cups leak so badly that I am going to return them. Even though the cup is supposed to be dishwasher safe I have only ever hand washed all of the parts so I am very disappointed.",0
"These are Still Too Big For My Nipples, But Better Than The Mediums. I Wish There Was An Extra Small.",1
"We bought this as we were traveling to NYC and needed an easy to travel with crib. I wanted something I could use in all kinds of travel situations and not have to deal with shipping a pack n' play or renting one or having someone have to buy one for us. The money is so worth it. We have now used this in a small apartment in NYC, as a play pen at home, on a 3 day boating trip and I can't wait to keep using it everywhere we go. So easy to put up and super strong and durable. No chances of tipping over. I love the little side zip too, you can make it a fort for your toddler by covering the top with sheets and blankets and they can crawl in and out. I can't say enough good things about this crib.",1
"Out of the package and straight into little fingers, he rolls them, bangs them and has a blast playing with these.",1
"Out of the box, its just what we wanted... my baby is not quite tall enough yet to walk with it, so i guess we'll have to wait and see.  one thing i don't like about it is that it will not work, at all, on carpet.  I also wish it had more fun things for the baby to play with.",0
"Standard size crib...3 mattress level choices. Can also convert to a day bed for a toddler. Easy to put together, fast shipping, great service!",1
Cute and simple. Nice change from a big bulky diaper bag and my son can use it when he gets older.,1
Purchased for my baby bag insert.The dimensions were correct and the fabric is not soft. very sturdy and would recommend to anyone.,1
"In the past I have ordered this brand and type of nipples for my son.  He only uses these.  When I ordered them this time however, they came with a strong chemical odor and taste.  I boiled them, ran them through the dishwasher and the odor and taste remained.  I am not sure what happened with this batch of nipples but I had to throw them out.  I am ordering from another company hoping that it was the seller and not the manufacturer.",0
So excited about this baby tooth album! Just put my son's first tooth in it.  It is adorable! Also purchased twinkle toof holder to use for the tooth fairy and it is amazing also!,1
"Now that my son moves a lot, the insert moves too and the adhesives end up sticking to his skin and irritating it. He's also had diaper rash which he doesn't get with Seventh Generation disposables.",0
"I love that these can be opened from either end.I've used these and a few other latch solutions.So far, these are my favourite. They also make great toilet locks and oven locks.",1
Really cute diaper cake that fit the princess theme of the baby shower.  Love the surprises on the inside of the cake.,1
"This is great for on the go feedings. Our daughter is a very do-it-herself sort of baby, so spoon feeding was very short lived. This is great for taking to restaurants or on trips. You can stick it right on the table for finger foods - then close it up tight and throw it in the diaper bag to clean up when you get home. Being able to securely close the feeding tray for transportation makes this product ideal. The only downfall is that sometimes the auction cups are not as strong as I would like, and my baby is able to rip it off the table. It depends on the surface. Usually a little water on the suction cups goes a long way in getting it to stick better. Ultimately though, this tray gives great bang for your buck!",1
"Took me a month before I decided to get this jj cole satchel. & I'm glad I did. It's a very pretty bag. Dosent look like a diaper bag at all. Got tons of complements. I own 2 Carter's diaper bag and personally, The jj cole satchel seems smaller. But it dose fit everything that I normally pack for my 3month old son. I love the four inside pockets It allows me to fit a lot inside. Just wanted to pass on the word that In other review they mentioned the straps tearing at the ring. Maybe I'll try and avoid that by using the long strap.",1
"This blanket is wonderful. Super soft, nice larger size, and still soft after several washes. I dropped it down one star because of the tag. My baby kept getting mysterious scratches all over his legs and arms and I had no idea what they were from. That is until I got scratched by the carters tag on the blanket! I don't know why these companies put such awful tags on items for babies, but make sure to cut that tag off as soon as you get the blanket. It is a tiny barely noticeable tag, but the corners are sharp.",1
Bought for our 30 month old grandson. .He likes it. .He sits and holds a few toys while &#34;making&#34;..it cleans up very well..no issues..I should get 2 more,1
"I guess I was expecting 'Natural scent' to smell more...well...natural.  The one I recieved said """"unscented"""" on the actual package.  Either I got the wrong product or """"Natural Scent"""" = """"Plastic Scent"""".  Dont expect any miracle smell here!",0
"We bought two of these, both from amazon prime, about a month apart.  The first one matched the picture above and the second had a light blue lid, handle, etc rather than the darker blue.  The darker blue one doesn't leak for the most part, as long as your careful and don't overfill.  The light blue one leaks like a mother at the lid when you start pumping / mixing.  It's not a tight enough fit.",0
Not a good product a month after using product the springs popped out of the chair. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.,0
"As a new mom, my first best friend was the ergo baby and now this is my 2nd best friend. I had an audio monitor when we had our baby because we got it as a gift. Though I was grateful for it and it helped a ton, but as my baby got older and started rolling out of the bed, I became uncomfortable with the audio monitor, so I needed a video one. Then I searched on amazon and got great reviews on this 1. I bought it, but the first one came defected with lines all across the video when I turn it on. I was so dissapointed because my whole family was eager for it to arrive. Motorola was so helpful and I received another one a few days later. The later one worked great. My son has gone from sleeping 40 minutes and waking up (because I have to physically go check on him when I hear his voice which wakes him up) to sleeping for 3 hours straight because I don't have to go check up on him all the time. It's AMAZING!!The only con though is that may be I don't understand how the lullabies work but I thought the music was for the babies while they're sleeping, but the video plays the music which means I only get to hear it, not the baby. Makes no sense to me.",1
"Don't know how long these contoured changing pads have been around but it's a GREAT idea!  Got this for my little sister and went to see the little guy and this was SO much better than anything they had when she was a tot!The kid was nice and snug, plenty of room to fidget but no danger of rolling off the edge.  Made it MUCH easier to block the pee fountain when you don't need a fourth hand to hold the kid still to keep him from rolling off!Seriously, greatest invention since the bread slicing machine.",1
Bought this as a second warmer to keep at grandmas house to make life easier... Was hesitant because of how cheap it was but was so glad I got it!! Would be a pain to fill the little tube with water everytime if it were the primary warmer at home but as a secondary it's wonderful. Is great for all bottles and use for food and have steamed passies in it when they fall and I don't have a back up with me!,1
"We use them in our all in ones, but they wad up pretty quick and only catch a portion of the the poo. Almost not worth the time to throw it in there. Not to mention they are only half the price of a disposable diaper per sheet (using subscribe and save)",0
"This was absolutely hands down the best brush set we have ever purchased. The large brush is great however, the small brush is ingenious! In the six months since my son was born I used the crappy sponge/brush combo brushes and had issues with milk residue and not being able to get in my pump parts. I found these by chance and thought they were cute so I got them. For the first time I can get into all the small openings of my Medela pump and completely into the nipples. This has changed the way we clean my pump and I can feel confident that I am doing the best job keeping the pump parts clean. THIS IS A MUST BUY IF YOU ARE PUMPING! Plus it looks so cute hanging on my twig on my lawn drying rack ;) It is so cheap just get it to try it... I am positive you will love it and not be able to live without it!",1
"This is a modern high chair to fit a modern aesthetic.  To address some others criticisms.. It is not heavy, so despite it not having wheels it is not a big deal to move it around...just not with the baby in it.  I like that the tray and crotch bar is one piece.... It is easy to remove though it takes two hands indeed.  The baby sees just fine, so I do not think its is too deep... The clear tray: baby figures out that comes off pretty quickly so using it is limited on top of the attached tray.  It is easy to wash and the one piece pad inside is a nice design although food still finds its way into the crotch strap opening.  I love this high chair. I wish I had purchased it at 3 months instead of 5 or 6 because my baby was passed the 16lb weight limit to use the reclined position...which would've been handy in place of a bouncer while in the kitchen for instance.",1
Very Happy with this product!! It is great quality and my son loves wearing it. He is 2 and it fits perfectly and is easily adjustable as well.,1
"These placemats are nice, very cute...but I mistakenly thought the price reflected a purchase of four (4) placemats and not just one.  I would have to say they aren't $19/piece cute, though.",1
"Not even kidding when I say this dinnerware set actually made my 3 year old WANT to sit at the table and feed himself. Usually he says &#34;feed me momma, i don't want to spill on myself (clearly got that from me) but with these I just tell him to come sit down and eat and he does so right away! Definitely recommend these, will be buying more variety for my son!",1
"I like the fact that there's no harsh chemicals on this toothpaste, but it natural flavoring.It helps with the fact that my son loves the taste of this toothpaste, which makes brushing his teeth easy.",1
"The mother of the baby I purchased this for, said she had to go out and buy a few more as an emergency!  She said her son took to only sleeping with this soft cuddly stuffed toy & blanket and that she was afraid if she lost in while she was out and about he would panic!",1
"I got Sophie for my baby when she was 3 months old, she is 7 already and still loves it, and others kids who see the Giraffe also get crazy for it!",1
"I thought I would love these bottles when I first got them, boy was I wrong!!!  First, you really have to check the nipples because they are perforated and you have to actually make sure the nipple holes are open.  Second, after a few times of washing the bottom leaks!!  This is the worst thing about them, after putting freshly pumped milk in there it was all over my counter! Talk about disappointment.  I have other family member who have the same complaint about them.  Seriously think about another bottle when purchasing!",0
"I now have two of these (one for each kid).  One is new and the other one I've had for over a year.  So far so good!  Although it's not tiny, its small enough to pack.  I take one with us whenever we travel.  It really helps with the noise when we're at a hotel (especially for mom!).",1
I purchased this product for mIy son . Sometimes he gets bored whenever he's in the car . With these items I can play with him and he will be happy.,1
I was rather disappointed when I got pink and purple pacifiers knowing that I am having a boy and thought I had chosen pacifiers that were specific colors.  The pacifiers themselves are like anyo other pacifier.  Nothing real special.,1
It's just made all wrong... the front sides are too short and not only does it not fit well... it leaks too... I read the other reviews and thought it couldn't be that bad so I waited til I had this for a few months before writing a review... horrible. save yourself the headache and spend a few extra pennies....,0
"The title for the review of this diaper bag kind of sums it up. Bought this bag for my daughter and her eyes lit up when she saw it. It is very colorful and fun and really does hold a lot of all that baby """"stuff"""". The bag is not so big as to hurt your shoulder. Highly recommend this one to any  mom who doesn't want to pack around everything but the kitchen sink! Lots of fun!",1
"I love these wipes. They are so soft and perfect for cloth wipes. I have read a lot of bad reviews, but it seems as though most of the people are not following the directions. The wipes come with a slip of paper that clearly says they are delicate because of the natural bamboo material. It also says to wash on delicate and DO NOT DRY. If you are using them for cloth wipes in your warmer (which keeps them wet and moist) why do they need to be dried in the first place?? I take mine straight from the washer and put them back in the warmer. They are in excellent condition.",1
"My grandaughter is now 9 months old and loves this jumper, she gets in it and has learned to spin! She will go in a circle backwards both directions and laughs and giggles until she is silly. We get such a kick out of watching her and have video taped her to send to all our friends and family who think it is hilarious! The construction is very well made and she is protected from bumping into anything when she does her special thing. She also bounces in it but enjoys the spin the most! I highly recommend it to everyone with a little one, they can become creative in thier own technique and enjoy it many ways.",1
Nice. Kids use it all the time. My daughter loves to turn it into a sleeper. Holds up well with rough play.,1
"We have a very basic floor plan and the kid's rooms are a straight shot down the hall to the den/kitchen, less than 50 feet.  There are only two walls in b/t and there was no reception at all.  We tried many different locations of both the monitor and base but no reception.  It worked fine at about 25 feet but that just doesn't cut it.We have since bought the Avent monitor which is more expensive but it has given us no trouble.Our previous F-P monitor had worked great for 3.5 years but with baby #3 on the way we needed a new one.",0
"In theory this is a great product. I purchased it about a month ago from Amazon and need to warn all future parents:1. PHILIPS DOESNT OFFER ANY WARRANTY IF YOU BUY ON AMAZON. Yes. crazy, right? Just spoke to them on the phone. If I had purchased anywhere else it wouldn't be an issue but they say that with Amazon they can't track where the product came from. So if anything is wrong with it, instead of dealing with your local friendly Philips agent you're stuck with Amazon's exchange process.2. It says that you can activate the nightlight and lullabies from the parenting unit. THIS IS NOT THE CASE. Now I'm not entirely sure if it's a software issue with my unit (that's why I tried to call Philips who then wouldn't help me because I said I bought on Amazon) but the long story short is that the parenting unit has not got any menu options to operate the nightlight or lullabies remotely.",0
"This is a cute little set, fantastic value.Two small beefs:1. These aren't microwave-safe. If you're not into microwaving plastic then you're fine, but I'm not a ""heat on a stove, use glass, blah blah"" kind of person. If it's BPA-free, I want to just plop something on, heat it up, and be done with it without having to do a ton of dishes. Plus my husband can't keep track of what's microwave-safe and what isn't, so I've had ot keep these completely away from the rest of our plates and bowls.2. The corners of the cups are a bit sharp. I won't let my son use these till he's a bit older, even for me they kind of cut into my lips.We got a similar set from IKEA that are actually microwave-safe, so we use those for most things and reserve these for sandwiches and cold items.",0
"I tried a couple of other shopping cart covers before I found this one. This shopping cart cover is amazing. It fully covers the cart seating area and velcros all around so that it cannot be removed by the baby. It leaves ZERO exposed parts of the shopping cart. My son was able to pull off the previous cart covers, and we were in constant battle to keep him from touching the icky shopping carts. Our problem has been solved thanks to the Babe Ease! I was debating between this cart cover and a very expensive one that had built in pillows on the sides for a nap. I try to plan my shopping around nap times, but sometimes it just doesn't happen that way! A simple solution I came up with was I use a very small pillow (that I keep folded in the cover in my trunk) so that he can rest his head.  He now actually enjoys napping in the cart, and the moving cart seems to be a soothing feeling for him at the same time! This cover is a thick fabric, has nice toy loops, very nice and deep side pockets that I use for cell phone, keys, coupons, sippy cup, snacks, etc. (very nice to have the option not to drag your purse around) and the cherry on top are the bright fun colors for a girl or boy.  One improvement that could be made is that it is very easy to lose the lap belt, and if we were going for perfection, I wish it was cushiony.  Btw, this cover will fit all carts, including the gigantic ones at warehouse stores.  Don't waste money trying others that don't get the job done, unless you are going to go for that really high end one (close to $100), which didn't make financial sense to me.  All in all, my shopping trips have turned from a stressful, negative experience to fun because my son actually likes his comfy play area now!",1
"I guess I should have read the product information closer, but this is not a blankie. More like a small toy animal to play with or hold. To me, a blankie is at least 12""x12"", or big enough to cuddle with. The ""blankie"" part of this is maybe 6""x6"".  It is cute and seems of good quality. Just has a misleading title.",0
When we decided to cloth diaper our little one we had no idea where to begin. I would defintely recommend this to anyone who is curious on cloth diapering. The quality is great.,1
"I second the other reviewer who said her baby bit the spout off.  Mine have used their teeth to gnaw the opening open even further, so now, milk or juice just pours out of it, which renders them pretty useless.  If I don't thoroughly check the remaining cups I have, I will either have milk or juice all over the place  If I don't keep on top of this, my babies are caught off guard by the milk pouring out of the gaping hole they made at the end of the spout.  I've tried looking for replacements because the condition of the actual cup is great, but I cannot find replacement spouts (interesting).  So, I've pretty much tossed all of the bad spouts, and replaced the entire sippy cup collection with a different kind of cup & spout design (holes vs. a slash in some silicone).  Bad idea Pampers!!!",0
These are so easy. My husband prefers these even over the homemade ones my mother-in-law made. They absorb well and the snappis just hook right on.,1
The medicine get stuck in the huge tip. After just one wash most of the labels came off. Base does not prevent leakage.,0
VERY HAPPY SO IS MY BABY IT STICKS WELL TO THE HIGH CHAIR DEEP SECTIONS FOR FOOD AND BABY HAS A HARD TIME TRYING TO UN STICK IT LOL,1
"My son is 19 months old now and I haven't used a diaper bag for him for a long time now; I just got tired of carrying a diaper bag with my purse.  This is perfect to hold a couple of diapers, some wipes, and a small changing pad.  The changing pad isn't big, granted, but I don't want a big one taking up all that space in my purse.  If you want a big, padded changing pad then carry a whole diaper bag!  This is just fine to put something under his bum while I'm changing him whether it's on the floor, a changing table, or in the back of the car.  The pod itself does have a small pocket on the back as well, which I find perfect for putting a few disposable bibs in for those times when we're out to eat and I haven't put a regular bib in my purse.  It works very well to keep everything together.  I'm also planning on using it as a diaper bag within a diaper bag when I have my second child in a few weeks.  The baby's stuff will be in the big bag, and my older son's stuff will be in this bag so that I can separate them easily when they are in different nurseries.  Overall, it's a great product and suits my needs.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it seems a little longer than it needs to be, but this may come in handy as his diapers get longer.  :)",1
"My daughter loves this nap mat. It is bright and the Minnie looks great. It isn't a lot of cushion but that doesn't effect how much my daughter loves it. The pillow is removable, which it like.",1
"I think this is a wonderful idea. However, it did not work for us. My son was somehow still able to wiggle his arm free, although I had followed all the directions and was using it properly. Maybe he is too big for it. I purchased the beige one. I guess I was expecting the fabric to be stretchier than it was. It felt like linen or canvas to me. It would probably be great for babies who don't move too much yet, maybe under 3months old.",0
"It took me 2 hours at 8 months recently to assemble this by myself. When on sale, it was cheaper than the local retailers and can't beat free shipping and returns. Looks great. Rich brown color, symmetrical parts, no defects or scratches, sturdy and easy to maneuver. Looks as good as a more expensive crib. Now we need to test it out with a real baby soon.07/09/12 Our baby has been using this for 8 months. And we love it. No problems whatsoever and she sleeps a sound sleep each night. Sturdy construction and attractive finish.",1
Makes drying the dishes so easy. Gives a frozen yogurt store vibe to the kitchen. More color choices for the bottom would be nice. Easy to clean. Fun to see.,1
"The design, including the colors are perfect for my baby daughter's room. But when I tried to adjust time, I realized how cheaply made it was. It's a clock, meaning that the core function is to have a solid time keeping mechanism. However the hands are flimsy and the whole clock portion can turn easily without much force. I am disapppointed that I paid that much for a product of this quality. It would get a much higher rating from me if it were cheaper.",0
"I just attached the organizer to our Chicco Neuvo Compact stroller and it fits great.  The velcro makes it easy to install yet sturdy.  I love having multiple pockets for storage because I've always got several things in my hands. Now I have a place to put those things and still keep them handy. I'm not concerned about my things falling out of the organizer since one pocket has a velcro closure and another has a zipper closure.  My phone with a mophie case on is not too thick to fit in the front mesh pocket which makes it easily accessible, too.I had to contact the company due to an error on our part and they were incredibly helpful.  I definitely recommend this organizer.",1
"These wall decals are a fast and easy way to add some cute art to your baby's room. My six year old son actually did most the placement of these in his little brother's room, they are virtually impossible to mess up and he was so happy to help get ready for the baby. The package came with enough decals for us to make a main mural and then place some animals, mushrooms, and acorns above the changing table and a shelf in the room. The images and colors would be great for a boy r girl's room and are not too babyish that they would want them removed until they get much older. We also purchased the matching canvases witht he owl and fox and they look great in the room with the murals.",1
"Pros for this swing:- Very soft, snuggly, fabric.- Mobile with lights, sound, and movement.Cons- The motor broke almost immediately, causing me to return this swing.",0
"I bought this for my daughter when she started potty training and now that she is potty trained, we use this everywhere, all the time. The playground, the zoo, the library, restaurants, everywhere!!!! It fits fine, we have had no issues with it on toilets, it sits on the front of the toilet, it does not cover the entire toilet, and the rubber on the bottom keeps it in place. It folds up nicely to fit in my bag. It has really made taking my potty trained kid out in public easy!",1
"I bought this for my son thinking it was a fabulous idea to allow him to safely drink from water bottles while we're out and about.... unfortunately, I have yet to find a water bottle this cap actually fits, it is too big!",0
"My daughter really hated to take a shower until I bought her this bath visor! This is a really magic toy, now she can't wait to wear the hat and take a bath everyday!!",1
"I was looking forward to an inexpensive all-in-one cloth diaper, but you get what you pay for.  The velcro doesn't stay closed when you wash them (I ended up trying to use binder clips to keep them closed, but that didn't work either).  On the 8th or 10th wash, one diaper's velcro stuck to another's and ripped it right off the diaper.  Very disappointing.  I can't even feel good about trying to resell these or giving them away.  A waste of money.",0
"I saw this in a parent/child magazine.  It is perfect for going to Grandmas and Picnics,  We are heading Up North for 4th of July and this will take up so little room in the back of the truck.  I was so amazed at the quality of the product.",1
i did like the item i would recommend  and the price was ok it went well with bedding set it was a nice size and wasnt to big,1
"This sleep sack is all too adorable!  It's soft, durable, and just the right length.  It's light enough for summer use with no concern of overheating.  I really enjoy the aden + anais line of products!",1
"I put ice in this for my son before he goes to school, he's three, and the ice is still full and almost the same size as when I put it in there, four hours later!! When closed it absolutely does not leak and only leaks a little out of the vent hole when open.  It is easier to draw on the straw, unlike others I have found that give you an aneurysm just to get a drink.  VERY well made, now to choose between the Mickey Mouse or Backyardigans one for a spare one for when the Toy Story Thermos Funtainer is being washed.",1
"We were expecting better since the stroller base which is made in poland is really solid, the infant car seat also performs well. The Stroller seat is really not up to par and a big let down. Material looks cheap, the straps are flimsy but safe and easy to strap. The cross bar is so far away that it has no real use. Our daughter is big for her age but there is not way to use it in a meaningful way. There is no other Stroller seat available for the T model so you have no choice. Needs better design and if Teutonia charges premium maybe they should also produce with better quality.",0
"I saw this while browsing and decided to get it on a whim, and I am so pleased with it. It is very nice to take into restaurants and you KNOW your highchair is clean. It puts them at your level and they feel part of the family. I love that it has a tray so again, sanitary eating surface. The plastic is easy to wipe down, but we haven't had any big messes to clean from the crevices, so I can't complain about that yet. It feels very secure once attached and the only thing to watch is that the table won't tip from the unbalanced weight. Two things I wish were easier, first, depending on the table thickness, we sometimes have to put the chair part-way on and put our daughter in before securing it tightly to the table, so it really takes 2 of us to do it safely. She just can't maneuver into the seat otherwise. And second, it is a bit bulky even though it folds almost flat. It folds to about 12&quot;x24&quot; (I am guessing, don't quote that) but we just leave it in the cargo area of the SUV and it's not bad. Really is a hassle when carrying the baby, diaper bag, and this seat at the same time, so I use it only when I have someone to help me. Once in place, it has been a wonderful purchase! Well worth the effort!",1
"We just bought a standard stainless steal trashcan like you would put in the kitchen.  It say to wash it in cold water, but I've been throwing it in with the diapers in hot.  I'll update if it falls apart quickly under those conditions. But it seems to be working fine.",1
"These little pouches are fantastic.  Super convenient, easy for the kids (and adults!) to hold and use, and so much less wasteful and expensive than similar disposable packs.Shipping was fast and customer service very helpful.  Thanks, Little Green Pouch!",1
"This lunch bag is VERY cute.  We haven't had it for long, but it seems to well made.  It is quite large too.",1
"Great lighting for many multi uses computer, sewing, desk work reading etc.  Grandchildren like to use it when doing homework at my home.",1
I'm happy with this purchase because aside from the tub being small I can hang in the bathroom. My son is 13 weeks and so far he's good for the tub. I would recommend.,1
The grinder does not work at all! The hand blender is ok. Not worth getting this. You are better of using a regular kitchen blender.,0
"The Dr. Brown's bottles work great, our little guy now has very few issues with gas or spitting up.  Once you get used to them they aren't that much more work to wash and clean and they have a dishwasher caddy that works well too.",1
Our son had a large flat spot on once side of his head (from always looking that way when sleeping/playing on the floor). We have had this pillow for 1 week and have already seen huge improvement! His head is almost the perfect shape after just 1 week! Great pillow.The only negative (not enough to loose a star) is that the pillow is hand washable only.,1
The bad:Part of the nylon fabric has already ripped.On my Bugaboo Bee this slides down and I'm constantly having to hoist it up.The angle means coffee cups spill out the back.Once baby faces out (curiosity after 4 months) the Ipad functionality is sort of pointless.the good:originalgreat looklove the wetsuit fabric.Lots of pockets and options.,0
I bought this for my daughters 5th baby. She loves it. It serves multiple functions and is integrated well.,1
This box is pretty but wow........so expensive for an empty box.  I guess you could say that about furniture but this is made of cardboard.,1
"We currently have 4 of these and I'm ordering another 2 pack.  I co-sleep and bed share with my 5wo newborn son.  These pads catch diaper leaks and leaks from breastfeeding in side laying position.  We have a very expensive mattress and this little mat has protected it really well.  It's also protected blankets etc on countless occasions. I wouldn't be able to keep up with the laundry if I didn't have these!  The only downside is that my baby is a little firecracker and sweats a lot during the night.  In the morning, the mat is saturated wet where his body is, so I swap it out for a new one each day. If there is a mess of another type, the mat goes in the washer. Our 4 mats stay in heavy rotation.  Yes, the cotton has pilled slightly after many washes, but it doesn't affect the softness or function of the mat.  No this mat doesn't breathe and I would prefer a 100% natural mat that did that, but I have serious doubts a wool one would protect our expensive mattress as well.  Quite simply, these are indispensable. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that it isn't made of entirely natural materials.",1
"Since the first time we placed him in it, he was bouncing, jumping and laughing. There is the right amount of interesting sounds and toys for him to explore for a while, and it helps him spend some of that extra energy he has.",1
"This is a cute potty seat but it's too small.  Granted, my 2.5 yo is big for his age (36 pounds, 39 inches) but it's rated for up to 50 pounds.  After he sits on it for a few minutes, the foam gets squished all the way down and he ended up sitting on the plastic rims.  Secondly, the cup is designed so that the penis goes under it, which works well to avoid overshooting but it's a kind of a pain to pick him up off the potty seat.",0
"We love this halo sleep sack for our little guy.  This is the second child that we used the halo sleep sacks on and they have been great for us.  I love that he uses it as a sleep que, when we get this thing out and put it on him he starts rubbing his eyes and yawning.  It keeps him at the perfect temperature and comfortable. He has also learned to stand up in the sleep sack in the morning in his crib without problems.",1
"When I bought this, the product title was not so explicit that it was one solid piece (shield + connector).  Therefore, you can't customize your shield size and I find it more difficult to clean than two separate pieces, and bulkier to store as well.  However, it does work with my pump; I just wish you could take the top apart.",0
"As noted by other reviewers, the top is not glass. That said, it does not detract from the appearance at all and it still looks like a very nice product. There were no scratches in the plastic or wood and it arrived in a superbly timely manner. The pieces inside fit snugly and they have a space that a name can be engraved later. It will hopefully make a nice display piece for the couple I gifted this to.",1
When baby is too little to have a blanket this helps to keep them warm and cuddly.  Just wish it had some kind of sleeve.  But it did keep her warm and she slept well in it.,0
Bought this for my sister as a Christmas gift and it has come in incredibly handy with my busy 16 month old nephew.  The only downfall is the size of some of the pockets and a few hard zippers but nothing to warrant a negative review.,1
"I have a pair of these clippers and came here to buy another one. I was surprised to see another reviewer remark that this isn't a good product because it broke after three years. (Isn't the definition of a good product one that lasts several years? Especially if it only costs $5 or less?) So I felt I should offer my own review.Many years ago when I had my first child, it wasn't easy to find good baby nail clippers. For me, files don't work (they take too long, the baby hates them, have to use them every other day, etc.) and scissors are simply out of the question (I'm nervous enough using safety clippers--why would I take *scissors* to my newborn's fingers?). Chewing on baby's fingers is bad--especially if you've ever had a cold sore!--because you introduce bacteria that way. And not cutting their nails is not an option for me. The 2 best clippers that I found 20 years ago were tiny versions of adult ones--I still have them (!) but they've dulled over the years--and my hands are bigger now! So, when I had my next child, I went on a hunt to find a really good nail clipper.This clipper works. It worked particularly well when my child was very small and I needed the magnifier. Now, more often than not, I don't use the magnifier--yet the shape, heft, and weight of this clipper fits my hand better than those tiny ones from 20 years ago, and makes it easier to keep a good grip and not drop them at a crucial moment. I can clip all ten fingernails (or all ten toenails) pretty quickly with this one, and not hurt the kid. I've been using it for eighteen months now, and it hasn't dulled at all. I've seen no cracking/breaking/bending or any damage or wear--though if I did, I'd just buy another one. The only problem is I only have one upstairs--none in the diaper bag or downstairs--so I'm buying a couple more. This is the best baby nail clipper I've found.",1
"It makes pumping worth it. I had a baby with medical issues; she had to be in the hospital for the first three and a half months of life. Therefore, I had to pump all the time in order for her to get breast milk. This bra was recommended by the lactation consultant at the hospital and was ABSOLUTELY necessary. This bra frees your hands and allows you get things accomplished while pumping or, at the very least, you can do something else to get your mind off pumping...just in case you need to relax to allow pumping to be more productive.It is worth it. Get one.",1
We like the fact that this is a very large playpen-we actually bought an extra side as to make it larger. I can put my 10 month old in this and not worry about her safety. She can tolerate for short periods but if longer she cries and wants out. Overall really like having this at home as an option for her.,1
"We washed this one time on warm and dried it on normal with the baby's crib sheets and all of our new baby blankets.  We didn't try it on the mattress for fit before we washed it.  I've never had sheets shrink, so I'm not sure if this shrank or was too small before washing, but it wouldn't go on the oval mattress at all.  Together my husband and I used a lot of force and were able to bend our mattress and get it into the sheet and zipped up... resulting in a majorly buckled mattress which now falls about four inches short of the ends of the bassinett!  And there is no way I'd put baby on something so uneven and uncomfortable, it's crazy.  We have no choice but to look elsewhere.",0
I was looking everywhere for a blanket for me new little girl!  My daughter has a pink one and she loves it and takes it everywhere! It is a little smaller than I thought but just as soft! I'm a happy Mom,1
"I bought this to take out the guess work and hassle of warming bottles, but it is not working for me. I try to set it so that I can turn it on, go change the baby then it would be ready. This method works occasionally but I get inconsistent results. Whenever the light turns off, the milk is still cold and I have to let it sit for another few minutes to finish warming. If I wait too long it's too hot, so I have to stand there and wait for it. Occasionally when I warm a bottle it somehow seems to boil the milk out if it. Don't know if the top of the bottle was loose or what but I'm finding it easier to just go back to sitting bottles in hot water from the tap. Very disappointed.",0
Works great and is a good size for smaller snacks. Being waterproof adds to the value. Will be picking up a few more snacks.,1
Had these for over a year and we don't even use them.  Just go to Wallyworld and buy the cheap $0.99 ones.,0
"Yes it does look nice in your nursery and yes so far it holds in the smell, but then again my baby is a newborn who's exclusively breastfed so her poops don't really stink, but in the long run this has turned out to be one expensive purchase. Not sure how well the smell will be contained when she's older and eating solids but between the pail and the numerous refills I wouldn't buy this again if given the chance. Should also mention that it's hard to tell when its close to being filled and I almost broke it once while trying to close the lid and it refused to budge and although it states that it seals the bag after every use once you open it to dispose of the bag you will notice that it looks the same as when you first put it in. I do agree that it is easy to use, easy to put in and take out the bags but still not worth it.We've gone through 1 pack of refills in 3 weeks and if you add it all up the price isn't worth it. I'm not being cheap, I can afford it but I'd rather spend my money on something that I don't have to throw in the trash.",0
"Pillow is fairly large, and shouldn't be used with a Full Size Bed. It also keeps and retains body heat which makes it very uncomfortable to sleep on it all night. Probably better for short naps, resting or reading books. Would not recommend using for a full good night sleep, unless you enjoy being extra warm all night.",0
I bought this for my 4mo old grandson. He looks even more adorable when he's sucking; I just cant keep my eyes off of him. Sizing was also perfect.,1
"I bought this for when my daughter had to return to the hospital for a planned surgery. She loved it through her recovery period. It played music, which I did not realize when purchasing it. Was most pleasantly surprised and thought the money was well spent. It has good picture cards to insert so baby has more to look at. But can also substitute for pictures of you and dad and anyone else you'd like your baby to look at. Great concept and more for baby than for parents (which I find most mobiles are for the parents and not really for baby).",1
"They seemed very painful for our child as his neck is not long enough and they have to be jammed in to try to fit.  They did the job once we were finally able to get him to sleep.  Took him to the NFC Championship and had a lot of fun, just seemed very uncomfortable for him.  If it had a large adjustable velcro area I believe they would have been better.",0
I had a different one with a differnt named LLC etched on the buckle which was much better than this one.  It does do the same job I suppose.  It is cute! One thing is that I find is that the length is def too short sometimes to reach the baby when its on the side of the stroller or tricycle!  I have to look for an area that I may not desire to have it placed.  Other than that the customer service was great when I had an issue with it!,0
"When the Zombie Apocalypse comes, this will be a stylish and comfortable way to protect baby's delicious brains from would-be zombie snack seekers.",1
"I bought the two pack so I could use one for regular stacking and the other for bath toys. Yes I'm aware I could have just bought one and dried them out after every use. But lets face it, she's over a year old, incredibly active and the time I have available to the most trivial household chore is now VERY limited. Out of all her other toys that were much more expensive, have buttons, lights, longs, she loves playing with these cups the most. Don't know why, but I'm not going to complain that her taste in toys is cheap and simple. Makes my job easier and better on the budget.The second reason, bath time. She would freak out every time I tried to rinse the shampoo out of her hair or soap off her face. Understandable, but it make bath time very difficult, so much so that she was starting to fight baths because she could sense the impending doom that was getting her head and face cleaned. So the stacking cups being her favorite toy along with them having small holes in the bottom let her have more fun in the water and the small holes in the bottom of the stacking cups let me gently shower off her head and face without a tantrum. It's a much better solution than just filling a cup and dumping it on her head.",1
"I really wanted to love these bottles! I love the size, shape and design, but in the end, they were just too fast for our newborn. We had better luck with the Avent classic nipple, but ultimately settled on the Nuk orthodontic bottles for now. It's nice there is no o-ring like the Avent classic bottles though, less parts to clean.",0
My daughter is 6 months old so she can't really do much with the ball yet but she loves to hold it and look at the adorable pictures. The ball is soft and I like that it's big so she can play with it when she's older too. My daughter also loves the &#34;chime&#34;-like jingle it makes when rolled. The color contrasts are pleasing to the eye as are the pictures on it and grab the attention of little ones. I highly recommend this ball.,1
"Parents, please don't make your baby deaf! There has been a substantial amount of research revealing that you can actually cause your baby to loose it's hearing from these kind of devices. In theory they seem cool, but the truth is that your natural speaking voice is plenty loud for your little one (enough so that they'll already know and respond to your voice when they're born). These electronic gizmos are MUCH too loud for your little one. Imagine someone blasting the speakers in your car till your ears rang, all in the name of &#34;bonding.&#34; Please don't buy into this fad!",0
"My 2 month old daughter absolutely loves this mobile.  She is a tough baby to please -- always fussy or crying -- but she can happily lie in her crib literally for hours cooing, smiling, squealing, and staring at this mobile.  She is absolutely mesmerized by it.  I thought about docking the review a star because it doesn't rotate on its own, but it doesn't really have to.  My daughter loves it anyway.  This mobile has saved my sanity on several occasions when she just wouldn't stop crying.  I put her under the mobile, and suddenly she is content, and I am even able to sneak a few minutes for myself.  I'll be buying this as my standard baby shower present from now on!",1
"I wasn't sure whether or not we wanted to get this for out daughter after reading the comments about babies getting flat heads.  We talked it over and finally decided to get the snug-a-bunny version ([...]) since it had extra padding for baby's head.  We have had it for a few days and already I feel like I was undercharged for it.  Our baby is sleeping SO well and was really struggling before that sleeping in the bassinet.  For parents who are struggling to get a good nights sleep, try swaddling tight and the snug-a-bunny rock and play sleeper, you won't regret it!",1
This is a great pump if you do not have to pump often and you don't want to spend lots of money.  I thought it was well worth the price.,1
We brought this rocker because our 4 month old outgrew her bouncy seat.  She loves it!  She is now 7 months old and still uses it every day.  We do have to watch her closely in it now as she can flip it over!,1
good car seat for the money. I just felt it leans a little too far back instead of sitting more upright.,1
"We just bought this monitor for our daughter, and we love it!!!! Our old monitor was picking up truckers on a local highway and getting crossed with another monitor in the area...weird because we live in the middle of nowhere.  We had enough of that.  Bought this monitor on the recommendation of a cousin who has twins and we just love it.  No static.  You can actually hear our daughter breathing!  I wish I had this when she was a baby.  We are going to buy another one for Baby #2 due this summer.  I highly recommend this monitor.",1
"First of all, this car seat is waaaaaay better than the one we returned (I think it was an Evenflo) to get this one, but there are still some flaws.The most important of which is the buckle is REALLY hard to buckle.  Not in a coordination type of way, but it's hard to physically get it to click into place.  My daughter's teachers put her in the seat everyday after school and I feel bad for them as I see them struggle to get it to click in.Also, we bought this seat as a second car seat after having a Britax convertible for over a year.  Although the Britax is easy to move from car to car, we were tired of doing that and wanted a seat that could grow with her for the main car.  Now that we've had this one for several months I am wishing I had maybe forked over a little more cash and tried the Britax version instead.  The quality seems better on the Britax.",0
"does not stick to the tub, and ii had a hard time trying to stick it and NO LUCK, dont buy this",0
Very nice quality & design. The 1st time we received the gown one arm hole was smaller then the other but the seller quickly sent out another without any problem & it was perfect.,1
This was my best friend during pregnancy. I slept with it every night and it took away all of my aches and pains. Super durable and comfortable for a huge pregnant woman,1
It works but the rails are too far apart for small dogs.  That's the reason for 4 out of 5.,1
"First, I want to say that I bought this toy at TJ Maxx HomeGoods for $3.99, not here on Amazon, but I did want to review the item for future buyers. My 4-month-old daughter is only slightly interested in this toy. I picked it up while walking around TJ Maxx since I forgot her diaper bag in the car, and let her play with it while I was browsing the clothes aisle. It may be because she's still young and not that into toys yet, but she just wrapped her hand around it and stared at it for a while. I would shake it for her so it made the cute ""tweet"" sound and she would look at it confused, but other than that she didn't seem interested in it. After she eventually put her mouth on it, I decided to buy it for her anyway. When we got home she didn't want to release it. She had a death grip on it for a while, but I think she just wanted to gnaw on it. My husband would shake it for her and once again she would give it the ""WTF"" face. I'm thinking once she is able to really learn the cause-and-effect aspect of it then she may play with it more.",1
"The gloves are prefect and stay on his hands. To prevent shrinkage, make sure to hang dry the gloves.would recommend to anyone.",1
Much larger than other receiving blankets! a great buy! very soft! nice color combinations. washes well! definitely worth every penny,1
"I bought this item for my son and his wife's baby shower. It will go well with their Dr. Seuss themed baby's room. The sheet arrived on time and well packaged for a safe delivery. The price is good, as non themed flannel crib sheets are the same price. I bought other Dr. Seuss bedding to go with the sheet, and now that the room is finished, it looks gorgeous. It is as bright, colorful and as beautiful as that baby will be.",1
"We've tried to get our baby to like this carrier, but he hasn't taken to it yet. It's rather roomy so it may be better for bigger babies (which would also comply with the manufacturer's recommended age). We're a little worried about the fabric covering his mouth when he's sleeping so I feel I need to check on him every 30 seconds which isn't great for getting other things done which was our whole reason for buying the carrier.Update: Our baby is now four months old and likes to sit in the sling facing out watching what I'm doing. I use it around the house occasionally while cleaning. He still doesn't like to be in it lying down. I'd probably still rate this three stars as I've found other carriers to be more useful though harder to put on and take off. I do like that this has a seatbelt to keep him secured in there but now that he's getting pretty squirmy I'm not entirely convinced that the seatbelt will hold him if he bucked hard enough to unseat himself so I still generally have one hand on him and only one free hand when I use this.",0
Goes great with our woodland themed nursery. 4/5 just because the top of the hamper is just a piece of cloth folded over the top. This makes it difficult to throw things in when one hand is holding the baby and the other hand is full of dirty clothes.,1
"These butterflies are very cute and match the kisdline jubilee bedding nicely. However, the adhesive on the back of them does not work... at all. I didn't even get the third one up before the first one fell off the wall. I am going to try to use wall paper glue to keep them up and hopefully that will work.",0
"I don't usually write reviews but these breast shields are so bad, at least in my own experience, I had to warn other potential users. I feel pinching pain when I use them, their color turns to some ugly shade after few uses, they seem to collect dust and lint from god knows where and I am positive I get way less milk with these compared to the orignal shields, which are perfect for me, unlinke what's listed in other reviews. my 2 cents.",0
Nicely made.  Very easy to install.  Impotrant - Bottom stays on the floor.  Would have been 5 Star if it had a knob/handle on the top (which I added) to make it easier to open and close.,1
"I bought this one to use with our toddler & newborn. She was about a month old when I put her and the 20 month old in it. I didn't encounter any problems with putting the newborn in there but I did put a headrest in it with her. It says not to jog with it until both kids are at least 6 months  old. We had to send it back to the manufacturer right after we got it because one of the side wheels didn't attach right, and the customer service was good but apparently they forgot about it a few days after the received it so there was a deley in getting it back. They had told us that they work on it the day they get it and ship it back. Well, not so, but it got repaired when I emailed them about it. After we got it back we had it about a month and then the front wheel started wobbling, and it happened when we were crossing a busy street, and we tried walking quickly with it to the other side, it started wobbling and slowing down and that was plain scary, we could have been hit. There should be a big warning label about that in the manual or something. I wish we could get a better quality one but the husband doesn't like spending more money on something than he has to. I like that the shade is adjustable, wish it could go all the way down. I agree that there shouldn't be a divider in the basket underneath and that it should recline a little more.",1
"This product is cheaply made, did not last more than a year, and broke easily.  Well, one of the units may have broke because I threw it at the wall.  Feels like it was made by a freshmen year engineering student from Brigham Young University.",0
St. Nick gave these to two of the new babies in their stockings last Christmas.  They are wonderful.  The girls grew out of them far faster than they could wear them out - the colors held up under all of the washings that 6 month old girls can generate.  Would highly recommend.,1
"I bought and compared five highchairs and this was the hands-down winner. My husband was skeptical about spending so much on a chair, but when he saw this chair side by side with the other slightly cheaper chairs he was convinced. Our son was happy sitting in this chair right from the start.We have been using it for a month now (and it's now cheaper than I paid!)UPDATED - after two months use there are signs of wear already! See list of cons for details (the pros haven't changed).Pros:- The chair is comfortable and doesn't have distractions (patterns, toys, etc) for our curious 7 month old.- It is easy to clean.- It has a footprint the size of a normal dining chair and as such fits nicely at the family table, even with the tray.- The tray is a decent size and easy to put in and out with one hand if need be. It also comes close to baby, so food is less likely to spill in a gap between baby and tray (this would have been a problem in 3/5 of the chairs we tested: bloom nano, joovy nook and astro).- It is easy to get baby in and out of the highchair (sounds obvious, but this was a major problem with the astro highchair).- It seems sturdy and well made, nice materials and looks great in our kitchen!Cons:- Erm, it's cheaper now than when I bought it!- After two months use there are fine scratches appearing on the arm-rests. This is caused by the tray sliding on and off, it would appear that the plastic on the arms is too soft and the finish on the slider part of the tray must be rough. Not what I'd expected to happen so soon for this price of chair.That said, I still love the chair and would recommend it to anyone willing to pay $250 for a chair.",1
The 4-5 size is perfect for my big 3 year old and still has plenty of room to grow. The lightweight material is very soft and gives him an extra sheet-like layer on warm nights.,1
"I give only 4 stars because of the bassinet mattress. It is too firm and our baby refuses to sleep on it! However, overall the product is good quality, the changer/napper easy to use. All babies are different. Just because ours hasn't adjusted to it doesn't mean yours won't sleep like a log in it!",1
This is the 1st review I have ever felt compelled to leave. I purchased this car seat a little less than a year ago and have been very pleased with it and then a few days ago I was struck head on by a drunk driver traveling at about 50 mph and my 3yr old son walked away from the crash completely unharmed. I can not tell you how thankful I am that he was uninjured and that his car seat performed exactly as it should have if I could give this car seat 10 stars I would I have already ordered another one to replace the one that was involved in the accident.,1
"I'm the mother of a 3 1/2 month old baby girl. I had intended to only breastfeed for the first year, but it turned out that my daughter had a very difficult time at first with latching on. So much so that she ended up taking in very little milk and her weight dropped nearly a whole pound from her birth weight in the first week. The pediatrician told us we would have to supplement with formula to bring her weight up. I chose the Premium Nurser bottles because they said they were good for switching between breast and bottle feeding. My daughter took well to the bottles, and even started latching on better when I did breast feed. I'm continuing to use formula along with breastfeeding with no nipple confusion problems whatsoever. When people ask me if I breastfeed or bottlefeed my baby, I say ""both"", and they tell me how lucky I am! These bottles are a life-saver! They're easy to clean (I use the top rack of the dishwasher), and my baby hasn't had any problems with colic. I like the convenience of the disposable bags, too. And my daughter is now starting to ""help"" hold on to the bottle while I feed her. These are the best!",1
Bought this for my daughter and it is huge! I can't see her fitting in anytime soon. Will update with comment when we actually get to wear it.,0
"We were looking for a solid, beautiful crib that wasn't made in China.  This was a great find.  I love the design.  It's very sturdy, not very difficult to assemble, and love that it's not metal.  It's pricey but worth it to find a made-in-america crib.",1
"We got this because it was highly recommended and I couldn't be more pleased.  Our large (10.5 lb.) baby loved it from day 1. He has reflux as well as IBS (although or pediatrician told us it was ""colic""). Our little guy would not have been able to sleep without this. This works well as a bassinet beside the bed and is light enough to move into the bathroom when mom needs a shower. I've read things about babies getting deformed heads and the parents blame it on this. I'm not a doctor, but I'm willing to bet if you leave your baby for extended periods of time on any hard surface they could get a flat spot on their head. Our little guy has slept 8-10 hours a night in this without incident. Also the Snuggabunny cover washes well. The SnuggaMonkey has since come out and I would love to have had that cute pattern!",1
"I can't believe I'm even saying this, but the plug cover portion of these covers - that is, the part that screws into the wall socket - doesn't fit.  I have regular plug sockets throughout the house, old style with the screw in the middle, and these things won't fit on any plug socket.  The holes are too narrow.....After some frustration and some thought, I realized that these outlet covers are designed to fit over the existing plug cover, not to replace it as most others do.  They are, in fact, not even big enough to enclose the hole in the wall, and once I realized that it all fell into place.In any case, that's the story.  Maybe it'll save someone else the aggravation.Are they any good?  Well, they do what they're supposed to do.  As others have said, very hard to remove, so only use them on sockets that will not have plugs frequently changed.",0
"It was the right size for all my kids stuffed animals, keeps them off the floor in between play time.",1
"2 of the bottles in the set leaked after the first use. I only noticed because I was warming them in a mug of warm water and it became cloudy. I had to throw the bottles and the breastmilk in them away, because I wasn't sure if the water got into the milk. I would suggest getting something else because although I understand some quality defects happen, 2 in the same set is not an acceptable ratio for me.",0
"I bought this as a gift for my niece. The detachable toys are a hit--the monkey is her favorite toy and is taken with her everywhere. She seems to really like the music as well. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because the mat is not as large as I would like (one roll and she us up against the bar), it does not fold up and store as easily as the Tiny Love mat that I had for my son and the mat is thin (but they all are so you need a blanket underneath if you don't have a carpet). I would recommend it to a friend even with those reservations.",1
"I am writing this review simply to reiterate what many others have noted: you have to understand that the dishwasher safe tray top is virtually useless, as most babies will grab the convenient handles and flip that onto the floor at a moments notice.  And the main tray is very difficult to clean as its a pain to keep water from running into the cracks and crevices and causing a mess inside the hollow tray.  It is NOT easy to take the tray apart to clean the inside.  I have twins, otherwise we'd throw this seat out and buy a new one.  As it is, we can't afford to buy TWO new chairs and are stuck.",0
"I was optimistic about this pail liner.  The instructions say to wash it with your cloth diapers and dry on hot.  Well, the lining just can't hold up.  It is cracked in spots inside the liner, leading to small driblets of old pee water inside my diaper pail, meaning I've got to clean out the stupid pail when I use it.  It worked fine for a few weeks then this started.  There's no point in having a pail liner if it doesn't keep old pee out of the pail.  I'm going back to less environmentally-friendly, but more practical plastic trash bags to line my pail.",0
Looked at tons of 5 point harness boosters. Decided on this one and glad I did. My almost 3 year loves it!,1
"Soft and gentle for a baby. Supports the head well, and the fact it is washable is nice too. Great buy!",1
"My daughter-in-law had never heard of these. I told her I am getting you one. I saw her look and it said, &#34;oh great another piece of baby junk to put in the closet.&#34; Welllllll....... this is the most used item for her infant and toddler she has. She is always using it for the baby but the toddler steals it when she can to lay on and watch tv or read her books or just to kick back. I would highly recommend it.",1
"If it weren't for Amazon's excellent return policy on baby items, I would be very upset about this item and would be forced to give this item 1 star for longevity issues.  The camera system is great out of the box for many months.  No problems using two cameras on this either here.  The problem is that within a years time, the night mode fades to black.  Bummer since the only time we use the system is when our child is sleeping.  Which I don't know about you, but our baby likes to sleep in rooms that don't have lights on.  Not sure what is going on with these exactly.  I am on my 3rd return for these.  If only these would't fade to black it would be absolutely perfect.  Thanks Amazon for allowing me to return these each time it happens.  Hope this is the last time.",0
"My 1-year old loved playing with the ball but unfortunately, the lid didn't hold up to the wear and tear of opening and closing.  The lid eventually snapped off completely in about a week.",0
"Our little grandson loves this seat.  Every time he is in it, the family is entertained watching him reachfor the little snail and the dragonfly!!",1
"I didn't realise that there were two dummies in each package, so got 6 when I ordered 3; I just didn't read the product info closely enough. They seem to be of good quality, and I chose them because my baby loves the Dr Brown's  bottles; unfortunately he is just not interested in using a dummy. I also didn't realise that they were orthodontic dummies - current evidence suggests that these are not good for babies, so I would not have chosen them if I had read a bit better.",1
"good quality but these are super small. I ended up replacing these with bigger more traditional washcloths. probably will not buy them again, but would consider buying a larger version.",0
"This fits snuggly and holds a lot of stuff.  It was easy to install (with some tugging).  I don't know what other mommies with this stroller would do without it, trying to push a couple kids and a water bottle, or drink.  The only thing I don't like about this, is that it gets in the way of my older son (4 yrs), who tries to get in and out of the back and has to duck every time and has occasionally gotten hung up on it (which is funny to this mommy, but not so much to him).  There's not many options for the Joovy, but this is a good one.",1
"I read the reviews and thought they were good so I ordered the set. Well, the reviews didn't do this set justice. This Spongebob deluxe toddler sofa, chair and ottoman set is GREAT! They came already assembled and all I had to add was the little legs which took about 5 minutes. The colors are very bright and my almost 1 year old loves it. He went right over to it and sat down. He hasn't used the ottoman yet, but it's a nice touch. The quality is very good, very stable and the material is very soft. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for baby furniture thats gonna last and looks nice.",1
I bought this through Amazon for my daughters baby because she wasn't sleeping more than a couple of hours if even that plus I babysit her and needed something for her to sleep in and help put her to sleep when she didnt want anyone other than mommy...this has been a lifesaver.Anyone having a newborn should have one its also great for a baby that seems to spit up a lot.It rocks so easy just put a toe on it and rock the baby to sleep plus its so light weight snaps shut and easy to take anywhere.Ayla is now four months old and loves to sit in it watching TV while I rock her I can even be on my lap top while rocking her to sleep thats how easy it is to rock with your foot.Both of us love this and have told others about it...this would make such a wonderful baby shower gift.The ones that seem to have a problem with their babies and their heads should buy something to support the babies head it would fit in the Rock&Sleep; and should stop the problem they are having.We started putting the baby in her's when she was around three months old(wish I had gotten it a lot sooner) so her head was still pretty wobbly I used a blanket in it without any problem so her head was fine.We think this is a must have for any new mother.,1
"I bought this stroller for my 3 & 1 year old. They love it! I read sooo many reviews before I purchased it. Great reviews! I have used it on the road & in our big country yard. It is awesome! My parents watched the kids last week. They said they used & loved the stroller, best stroller. Said i needed to tell my siblings about it. Got this for a great price & am so glad that we bought it. My husband has pushed the kids in it too & really liked it. I think we will be putting lots of miles on it. Highly recommend this stroller!",1
"When I first got it the squatty potty did not work for me. I had it for three weeks and no """"slide"""" moments for me. I guess my body had to adjust to this odd positioning because now it works just fine. I even lost some weight which made my purchase even better. This is a really good product especially if you are having problems """"going"""" like I was. It really works like they say it does with minimal effort.",1
"This potty seat is great, it's comfy and very functional for a boy. Plus my son loves it. One easy to clean piece with very good pee guard, fits great on my oval seat, soft, no red marks on the bummy, wonderful product.",1
"I use Rumparooz (Kangacare), Happy Heinys, Bum Genius, and GroVia. The first three brands I use AIO pocket diapers, for GroVia I use the shell system. The shell system is perfect for when my son is wearing something with a tighter fit - the pocket diapers are just bulky, so they take up more space under his clothes. He is only 4 months now, so perhaps once he is a larger baby, the bulkiness of the AIO will be less noticeable. The disadvantage is that these shell diapers are more likely to leak if he has a ""blowout"". I use with the biosoaker pads, which do take noticeably more time to dry after washing and are more prone to staining (although sunning them takes it right out). My son is fairly regular, so we just make sure not to use these when he's going to be having a BM. I do like the trimmer fit much better than the AIO. It is also convenient to just snap the pads in and out, so you can get multiple uses out of one shell. However, if your baby is prone to large BM, they would not be a good buy. I would never use these for an overnight diaper, they would leak far too much.",1
My baby hates this. I think its too firm because he cries as soon as he is set in it. I really wanted him to like it because it would work great for us. Luckily he will sleep in a rock n play which I feel is a much better purchase.,0
This is a real product but bulky and difficult to folds hen not using it. I jus wish that Schwinn would make the stroller with the wind protector in the visor like they did in the previous models cause even thought this is a great product it's just too much to bring with ou everywhere jus in case!,1
"I loved this cover. The others were too long and big, which made it look like I had a big sheet over me. The Kushies canopy was the perfect size. It covered by son without making him too hot and was comfortable for me. I highly recommend.",1
"I just bought these at my local IKEA for $1.99 each set.  They are sturdy, and the colors are bright and fun for both boys and girls.  It's just crazy how expensive they are when someone other than IKEA sells it.",1
My daughter has an immature bladder and has to be reminded every 30 min to use the bathroom. Since she is in school and I am not there to remind her to go I thought that this was a good idea and it was preschooler friendly. Well I recieved it on a friday and by sunday it no longer worked! I replaced the batteries but it never worked again. I do not advise anyone to buy this product!,0
"Must have with three grandsons in the back of a new car. You can belt them into car seats, but the feet fly freely.",1
"easy to assemble and it looks really elegant. No too fancy, no too girly, but not said at all.Good materials",1
"It's harder than it seems to find a replacement pad/mattress for a standard Pack and Play. This is the perfect size. It's softer and thicker than the mat that came with the Pack & Play, so be sure that's what you want. But it fits perfectly, and it's exactly what we needed at a very reasonable price.",1
"This is a great high chair, we love it - how it looks, how it works, how customizable it is, everything. With this chair,baby can be at the table with us, which is perfect since we want to emphasize the social and family parts of mealtimes together over the food itself (food before one is just for fun).My only complaint would be that you have to half take it apart to reconfigure it (seat depth, level for footrest), but since that's not something that's done very often, it's not a big deal.You don't really need any of the available accessories: the cushions are just going to get dirty, though a case might be made for them if you're having baby join you at the table before he starts on solids; the tray is unnecessary, since the biggest selling point of this chair (for me at least) is the fact that it will fit at a regular sized table.Even the baby insert that comes with this set might be unnecessary depending on how good your baby is sitting and how enthusiastic he is while being strapped in. We did use it for about two or three weeks and then took it off. In retrospect, we should have either gotten the seat earlier and just have baby play at the table, or not gotten the baby insert. If you *are* interested in the baby set, I would recommend you get a different colored one - it's plastic and doesn't blend in with the chair anyway, so might as well throw in some color to make it fun.",1
"adorable outfit, fits baby snugly and looks great! got a 0-3 month size but it stretches and still fits at 6mo!",1
I would recommend to any one.  A great value compared to similar products.  I bought more expensive ones first.  These work just as well and are super cute.  Wish I had found these first.,1
"My son, niece, nephew, cousins - well all the children I know - LOVE Yo Gabba Gabba. I bought a few of these and was excited - for about a week, then I saw them at Walgreens for 3 dollars less. NEVERTHELESS, the product is worth the extra 3 dollars in my mind. YOOOOOO GABBA GABBA!",1
My 6 month old loves these blocks. They are soft and easy for him to grab and he loves the bright colors.,1
"That's about all I can say about these washcloths. They're very thin, so after using them for a couple months they curl up around the edges. And being thin makes it hard to keep a grip on them while washing little bodies- they keep rolling up in my hand. Stain easily, but I will say the color hasn't faded. And they haven't started falling apart, so I'm still using them. There are worse washcloths out there, but these are certainly not the best.",0
"Awesome drapery, muchs better than pictures they are wonderful for our little girl coming on november, fabrics is elegant and the color just match perfect with the room, we where looking for draperies longer than 80&#34; and this are 100&#34;",1
"This is the only product we tried that worked to keep our toddler out of the fridge, yet was easy enough for our 5 year old to use.  And, because it's clear, it's discrete.  You can still open the refridgerator slightly when it's in use, but not very much.  However, if your kids do open the door slightly before the latch catches, you may need to remember to close the door back.",1
"I recently purchased 1st Years True Fit Recline, Evenflo Symphony 65 & Safety 1st Complete Air. I was having a tough time deciding between the 3 and since I live in a rural area, where they were not available to see in person, I took advantage of the free return policy at Amazon.The Pros:-Very light weight-Heavy-duty chest clip-High safety rating & side impact tested-Adjustable headrest-Straps adjust very easily-Lots of cushioning-High backThe Cons:-Very large ""air"" wings (as I call them). As stated in previous reviews, they stick out quite far, and would most likely hamper a childs' line of sight. We have a 20+ minute drive home on gravel roads, so this would be an issue for us.-Frame is plastic - which makes it nice for moving between cars as it is very light weight, but I didn't feel it was as safe as the heavier, Symphony. Although I do realize they have to pass the same safety tests.-I drive a 2003 Ford Escape, and have the seat almost all the way forward as I am only 5'4"". RFing the seat, the top of the seat hit the back of my drivers' seat. This meant that there is no way anyone taller than me would be able to drive my vehicle with this seat installed. The base of the car seat also hung partially off the seat of my car, so I just did not feel that it was a good fit.-Fabric was not overly soft/comfortable feeling.I ultimately decided on the Evenflo Symphony, although this was a close 2nd! All 3 seats were great seats, and cost very similar. In the end, you have to choose which seat fits your child & vehicle the best! This one just wasn't right for us.",1
"I did not buy these bottles from Amazon, as I really needed them faster than in 2 days, so I just went to the store and got some. We got one of these bottles as a free sample with a package of goodies we got from our pediatrician. We were also given a large set of the Philips Avent bottles, which is what we were using, and everything seemed to be fine, our baby was a little gassy at times but that's to be expected right? Well, eventually we ran out of Avent bottles, but we still had this Similac one we hadn't used yet. Our baby took this bottle better than the Avent ones, and has (so far) been a lot less gassy. I became an overnight believer and went out and bought 6 more of these, and the on-the-go formula mix caps (very convenient!) for them as well, the very next day. These are great bottles, our beautiful little boy's favorite!",1
My daughter LOVES IT!! It is narrow though--make sure and measure your area first. It is very soft and fluffy!,1
My 18 month old Grandson loves it.  Couldn't wait to use it!  Great Price and great material.  Couldn't find anything like this in our local stores.,1
I had been searching for an affordable glider for our nursery for months. After some back and forth on whether to get this one without being able to test it out in person we decided to go for it and are glad we did. Fits great in our son's smaller room and is very comfortable. Glides and swivels very smoothly and we have gotten many compliments on it. Would definitely recommend it to friends since many other gliders out there are 2-3x the price!,1
"Easy to assemble, beautiful colors, cute design and our nephew (2 months old) love it. It is really convenient that it have different music settings.",1
This toy hammock is superior to products I have purchased in the past. It has nice thick elastic around the edges and comes with its own mounting hardware.,1
"These work absolutely wonderful.  My newborn daughter likes to launch hers and somehow get them to land under her bed.  They stay glowing for really long periods of time, which makes them much easier to locate at 2am when she loses hers.  They are the best!!!",1
"I didnt like the way these looked after they are applied.  I thought it would be like the word sayings you place on your wall and you do not see any edges.  On these after you stick them there is 1/4"""" to 1/2"""" of the clear/cloudy edges you can see on your wall.  I did not like this.  It makes it look like a kid put stickers on your wall.",0
"Could be better. It is hard to EXACTLY push the cap down directly onto the nipple and keep the nipple at 90 degrees. The tightness of the fit with the base of the screwtop nipple lock causes it to skew to one side, leaning the nipple...meaning that anytime you turn the bottle with the cap on and the liquid hits the nipple opening, you are prone to have a leak. I've had these caps fill with Similac when the bottle topples over in a diaper bag...try feeding a hungry baby in a mall with a cup full of milk that is about to leak all over everything...not fun...To improve the product, there should be an upside-down saucer-shaped plastic piece in the dead center of the inside of the top of the cap. This would guide the nipple to a perfect position every time, eliminating the problem above.Also, this cap gives you no real grip on the top of the bottle. Avent bottles seem to almost weld themselves shut after a few hours in the fridge. Try opening an Avent bottle with this cap on. About half the time, the condensation on the bottle requires me to take the cap off to get leverage on the Avent screw-on nipple locking ring. But maybe it's just me...I don't know.On the plus side, they are very easy to clean, very easy to stack, and float nicely in a sink full of water.These are just bottle caps...what do we expect?",0
"I bought this for my sister's baby, and it's very pretty, affordable and durable. I would really recommend this baby bath tub. she really loved it.",1
"One reviewer stated this mattress is a ""Perfect Fit"" for her Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Brand Mini bassinet. IT IS NOT. In the comments under her review another customer asked if she was able to get this mattress in the correct measurements, which are not 17 x 31 but rather 18.75 x 31.5. She replied to that customer that she just doubled up on sheets to compensate for the gap this mattress leaves in the Arm's Reach/Co-Sleeper Brand Mini bassinet. This trick does not work -- I tried it -- and even if ten sheets made it fit snugger, it's not a safe fix. This is just the wrong size mattress and jerry rigging it to work isn't responsible -- the mattress is a suffocation hazard in these bassinets.I bought this for my Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Brand Clear-Vue Bassinet. The measurements between the Mini and the Clear-Vue are IDENTICAL. Even the Arm's Reach/Co-Sleeper brand website says about the Clear-Vue bassinet: ""Same size as the CO-SLEEPER brand Mini, this product takes the same accessories!"" The listing for the Co-Sleeper Mini here on Amazon, as well as the tag on the mattress included with my Clear-Vue bassinet, both say the measurements are 17.5 x 31.1 x 0.8. THIS IS NOT TRUE. On the manufacturer's own website they state clearly that the organic replacement mattress size is actually 18.75"" x 31.75"" x 1.5"" and this goes for the Mini as well. This information is provided when you click on ""Accessories"" and attempt to buy a replacement mattress pad for these bassinets. Only THEN do they tell you what the ACTUAL measurements are for these mattresses. The mattress I am reviewing here on Amazon now is FAR too small to fit these bassinets. When I put it in today I was shocked. There is a HUGE gap all the way around the mattress that is nothing short of a death trap for an infant. The mattress should be so tight/flush with the walls of the bassinet that there is no way for the baby's face or head to slip into a gap and suffocate. This mattress should be 18.75 x 31.75 and not 17 x 31 like this one.Plain and simple -- this mattress is TOO SMALL for the Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Mini bassinet, the Mini Convertible bassinet or even the Clear-Vue bassinet. There is an organic mattress offered by the manufacturer for $80 but it's not as thick as this mattress I'm reviewing now. What I have to say about the quality of this mattress: it's thick and soft (maybe even lacking firmness to a concerning degree?) but it does not fit my bassinet by any stretch of the imagination so it must go back. I hope this review helps future owners of these Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Brand bassinets so that they don't waste their time and money on return shipping costs like I'm about to do.",0
"I purchased this rocker for my grandson's first birthday after having read many reviews of other rockers. &#34;Sheldon&#34; arrived quickly, safely, and with &#34;No assembly required&#34; which made all of us happy. So far, this is a strong, steady rocker for a 1 year old. The music is very cheerful. The only thing preventing me from giving &#34;Sheldon&#34; 5 stars is that his eyes/glasses have already been pulled off due to the fact that they are poorly attached on the nose bridge only of the glasses. What 1 year old wouldn't have those floppy glasses pulled off in no time???? This could/should be better produced by the maker.",1
Brightly coloured and cushioned enough in case of falls or toppling over. This number mat was alot smaller than expected. Wish I had not bothered buying this one but the alphabet one instead as this is way too small even for just one baby to play on. May have to buy another set to add on in order to have more playing space. I bought this for my 6 month old girl to practice sitting on as it provides more cushion than just carpet incase she falls but found I could not turn away for even a second while she is playing on here as she could pull the piece up and start chewing on the knobbly edges. (Choking Hazard) So please be extra careful when leaving your baby to play on this. Beware and becareful to those who are considering buying this product.,0
"This dining chair is wonderful.  It's easy to use, portable, comfortable and makes your little angel really feel like they are part of the family.  My son absolutely loves this seat!  We take it with us when we dine out---no more worry about him sitting in a less than sanitary high chair at restaurants.  I have not found a table yet that this seat is not compatible with...and I've used it on a ton of different tables.  If you have room at your dining table, this is ideal.  We have an eat in kitchen with limited space and the standard stand alone highchair was taking up way too much space.  This is perfect!  Can you tell I'm in love with this chair?  Just as a side note, it cleans up quite nicely with simple soap and water.",1
"The BabiesRUs store I went to did not have one out of the box to look at, so I went off of what I could tell on the box.  Once I got it home, a few things became obvious.  First, it would not work with my stairs due to the lack of a stud in the proper place on the wall side.  I realize that is not a design flaw in the product and just an incompatibility.  However, I also found it to be a poor design.  When the gate was open, the two pieces would freely slide in and out from each other.  Due to the space between the two pieces, it presented an obvious pinching hazard to little fingers and adult fingers alike.",0
"She liked it, It has held up to 2 months of abuse pretty well. It does look like someone took Elmo's pelt 8-)",1
"I bought for my daughter-in-law and she loves it, its all about ladybugs for her.....thank you....keep up the good work Amazon.com",1
Summer Infant SwaddleMe.  Unless you work at a nursery and swaddle babies perfectly everyday than this SwaddleMe is a must have.  This swaddle blanket is dummy proof.  Or should I say new parent proof.  We had issues waking up all hours of the night because our baby busted her arms out of the blanket we tried to swaddle her in.  The SwaddleMe is shaped in a way and has velcro to allow the blanket to stay together and firmly around the baby nicely. [...],1
"I wanted a diaper changing pack that folded out with pockets for everything when it is laid out. This is NOT that type. It will probably get used, but I think I will still have to buy one of the ones I originally wanted. The pattern is pretty (although a the black is more faded in person than it seems in the picture, due to the sheen-or lack there of-of the material this is made of). The extra bag packs that it comes with is nice, seems it will last a very long time. The clip on the bag dispenser kind of sucks, though. I probably wouldn't have purchased had I seen this in person first, but I wont be returning it. Seems that it will fit a good amount of diapers and wipes. Not sure if I trust the zipper pack that it comes with for wipes (not sure if it will keep them completely sealed to prevent drying out).",1
"purchased this for my grand baby, but this doll is not very cute!  Bigger than I expected and I don't care for the fabric used in her dress.Thinking about sending it back!",0
Works well with the car seat. Large enough to hold most cups. A real plus for the car seat. I would buy it again.,1
"I bought this carrier for my granddaughter, since they don't carry them in the stores any more. Just as it did when my own kids were babies, it has come in very handy. My 2 week old granddaughter is very comfortable in her carrier, and my daughter is now able to take her anywhere around the house while she sleeps happily.  The knobs on the sides could be a little more sturdy when adjusting the handle, but all in all, it's very nice.",1
"This kit is a little pricey when for a few dollars more you can get bottles with all these parts, but it is nice to have them on hand in case a bottle gets dropped & a collar busts.",0
"My nephew loves this car seat! Its easy to use and light weight, so its easy to transfer from car to car.",1
"There isn't anything wrong with these, but I was just underwhelmed by them in general.  I don't think my supply suffered while using them, but I can't say that I saw any improvement, either.  They don't nest, so storing them means they take up a lot of space, compared to the standard flanges that come with the pump.",0
"I LOVE this stool! It's so, so sturdy. Will not tip over, even if an adult puts all weight on just one side. It's light and easy to move. It could be a tiny bit taller, but that will obviously be less important as my daughter grows taller.",1
"The cover of this book is well designed. However, it's more like a guest book than a keepsake book. It has several pages for guests and addresses but only 1-2 pages for pictures. There are a few pages for games and activities but it's in a list format. There are 3 sections for showers which repeat. The hosts, guest list, gift list, pictures, and games and activities. I would not recommend this product.",0
very convenient to carrySmooth for my daughter.Only flip side is the cup holder falls out whenever you fold otherwise everything is fine,1
A very well made toy with vibrant colors and plenty of activities. I picked it up from a toy recycled shop and it looks like brand new. No peeling of paint anywhere. My 18 month old baby likes it and has all the different activities to keep her busy. I absolutely recommend this toy for toddlers and crawlers.,1
"When I had my first child my employer didn't have a private place for me to pump.  Since I refused to pump in the bathroom as everytime the toilet is flushed it sends bacteria and feces into the air, my only option was a battery operated pump.  I bought it at BRU, and besides the noise and millions of batteries I went through it was okay.  I didn't however pull enough of the milk out of my breast and I started to develop mastitis in both.  I only recommend this item if you have no option buy to use battery operated devises, other wise, spend the money to buy a nice one, you'll send it eventually in batteries anyway.",0
"I was rather disappointed with these; the rattles are very faint and the sizing is small, so if you have a robust child then they will probably not fit. My son does like to suck on these (although to be honest he sucks on everything within reach) but other than that there's not much to them. I would have liked a stronger rattle, which is the reason why I got them.I currently use them to attach other toys to the handle of his car seat since the velcro is good for that and strong enough that he can't yank the toys down on himself.",0
This necklace was just made of plastic.  It looked like someone just went to a bead store and made a necklace.,0
This is the softest blanket ever! I am super excited to use this for my son and will be buying another!!,1
I bought this for my car for my granddaughter.  I had bought one previously for my daughter-in-law's car and she loved it so when it came time for me to have one for my car I bought another one.,1
"I love the bottle! The only issue that we have is that since my daughter uses it without the handles, the area that you hold the cup is the exposed metal. The rubber should go a little higher, one to give it a better grip, second if you pure in warm tea you don't want your child to have a problem holding it because. The metal feels warmer than the liquid.",1
"We've used this pail for 2 months, and have only minor complaints...  It is quite short, so I have to lean over pretty far to get under the lid.  Also, it's difficult to get the lid on tight, and if too loose, the pedal won't open the top all the way and I have to lift it by hand.Because we cloth diaper, the small size is a good thing.  It holds about 12-14 cloth diapers, which makes for good timing to do laundry. It only smells when open (I don't have any air freshener/filter in it), and is easy to use when the lid is on tight.  Cost is right, and I'm glad we didn't spend more than we needed to (babies are expensive enough).",1
Good car seat for the money! Easy to install and it is very It could use some more padding. s,1
"This pad is soft and absorbant and everything it claims to be.  I was perfectly happy with it and planned to give it five stars--until I washed it several times.  At that point, the long edges started fraying.  I have no idea how bad it would have gotten if I'd left it alone.  It might never have gotten any worse.  However, I didn't want to take that chance, so I sewed some quilt binding on those edges and now it really is close to perfect.  I would recommend it, but would also warn of the fraying problem.  I've owned it only a few months, so I can't speak to its overall longevity, but I really am happy with it and hope it lasts a very long time!",1
"Indeed this is not the cheapest potty stool on the market, but is worth every penny. It is very sturdy and stable, making it very comfortable and quick for a young toddler to get up on the big potty. There are enough things to worry about when toilet training, getting up on the potty should not be one of them. The railings give kids extra leverage when bearing down to poop. It's also easy to clean as it's made of several large, interlocking pieces of plastic. If you choose to forego a potty chair and start potty training on a regular toilet (like we did), this potty stool is a &#34;must&#34;.",1
"It's a beautiful car seat, but as soon as you place a child in it you see that the leg strap is under his bottom.  And my son is only 31 lb right now, about 3 foot high. so we're not talking giant here.  We did not buy it.  We looked at Evenflo Maestro and Britax Frontier... And we bought Britax.  May be the difference in quality between the 2 is not the same as the difference in price, but we just could not resist.Do not buy a car seat based on reviews only.  Go to the Babies R Us and try!",0
"My 3 1/2 year old gets really frustrated he can't turn on the lights himself, so we purchased these.  They did the trick and he is so happy he can do it himself!  Great product!",1
"We use these inserts with the Bum Genius pocket diapers. We use two of these, a hemp insert, and a fleece liner above the pocket (right next to son's skin) and this does the trick! We were hesitant about spending so much on the pocket diapers and everything else, but it has been so worth the money!! He hardly ever gets rashes any more. He used to wake up with bad rashes when we just used two pre-folds (and he had a HUGE diaper butt!). These inserts are very absorbent and we would definitely order more of these if we needed more.",1
It is a nice canvas bag but it is HUGE!!! If you are looking for a bag that can carry everything and the kitchen sink you found it! Seems like a nice beach bag but it is just to big to carry!,0
"We really like this company.  We ordered a stroller from them and used it for several months.  Somehow a piece got bent on it, so we ordered another one.  We then realized it was still under warranty and called the company to explain the situation.  They asked us to destroy the damaged stroller and they would send us a brand new one, which they did.  It was relatively simple really and they were friendly about it.  Very pleasant customer service experience and we couldn't ask for much more.  We still aren't really sure why the piece bent, it was the main support lock piece which affected the stability of the stroller, but at least they replaced it.  We had used it a lot and taken it on several trips so it did't just fail arbitrarily.  It probably should have lasted longer than it did, but the new strollers are great and hold up just fine and we still really like this company.  It folds down really small, is comfortable for the kiddo, and has room to hold stuff.  Obviously we think enough about them to have owned three now and we would buy another.  For the price, you can't beat this stroller.",1
"After receiving the Snoogle, I have had the best sleep of my pregnancy. I recommend to anyone who is pregnant- or anyone looking to make a pregnant loved one happy. I use it in a U-shape- so that I have head and neck support, as well as leg support for sleeping on my sides. It is my favorite Valentine's Day present ever!!! I cannot imagine sleeping without it. You can use it in so many ways- and shapes for so many positions. I look forward to using with my newborn baby as well. When we have baby #2- I will use it again for sleeping. It is a great buy!",1
Its pretty nice. I'm hoping my 4 month old will like it better as she gets a little older. The toys are really cute. I like the inside padding.,1
I just wish it came with 2 of the ice packs so when we forget to freeze one there would be a back-up.,1
"Really doesn't do a very good job, I was very disappointed in all the raves people posted, but I couldn't get this pump to pump anything at all! A few drops at most. I bought it because it was portable and had good ratings, but I do not like this because it didn't work for me. Your hands get very tired very fast, for how little comes out, so you aren't getting what you are working for, lots of cramps trying to get more milk out for my baby. Medela swing pump worked very good for me.",0
"I got this potty seat when toilet training our now 3 year old and we love it.  It fits our more rounded toilet perfectly and now I'm ordering it for our elongated seat.  According to reviews it won't fit perfectly, but when we've traveled to see family with this it was always very stable, even if it didn't fit perfectly.  My daughter is comfortable with it and actually asked for another one in lieu of our potty seat with an integrated step.  We'll just get a stool or step so she can get up to it.  We've never used the deodorizer disc and I don't think we ever will so don't worry that you'll be replacing those things constantly. Don't waste your time with bells and whistles.  This potty seat is all you'll need.",1
this his perfect. My son is 9 months old but is as big as most 1 year olds. this play pen is the perfect size for him and his toys!!  He takes his naps in there and is very comfortable.  It collapses easy once you get the hang of it and is very portable from room to room.  Its kind of heavy so I dont think I'll be transporting it anywhere outside of my home but its great so far!,1
"I bought these for my 9 month old.  They aren't very fun for her.  The bulbs on the toy are hard to squeeze.  I don't think she will be able to make them work for quite some time... maybe 3-4 years old.  My six year old can squeeze them, but doesn't play with them long.  I wish they had been made for little hands to squeeze.",0
"These nail scissors are hands down, the best baby purchase I have made. They are sharp and get the job done in seconds. no fiddling around with the handle on the clippers and no worries about snipping baby's skin. The scissors that come in the grooming sets are garbage, they are dull and don't work at all. These Piyo Piyo Nail Scissors are amazing.",1
"This is by far the easiest assembly ever, the quick action fold is amazing (one hand yea!!!) I love it another great Graco product.",1
"I LOVE this cup and so does my son. I gave this cup to him at about 8 months old. It has a great squeeze feature for parents, so you can squeeze the bottle and the liquid will come up. That help alot so my son could learn that his drink was in there and he had so suck it to get it old. He is almost 11 months old and i still cannot find a straw cup as good as this one. I bought any other ones but it is WAY to hard to get liquid out, even for me.",1
I am 7 mos pregnant and this was the best purchase I have made so far this pregnancy.  It supports my tummy and back at the same time helps me get good sleep that has evaded me for a while.  First drawback is the head pillow part w/c is not that supportive so I use another pillow on top of it to lay my head while I sleep.  Second point is the size.  It is big.  We have a Cal King and you can see how this pillow could gobble a sizeable portion of the bed.  Otherwise every one in the family loves to use it so most of the time it is unavailable.  My daughter wants a small one for herself.,1
fits and holds my stuff perfectly in my Ranger and works well for my storage of items. Holds in orderly fashion.,1
"bought it b/c needed something to distract my little one during restaurant outingsdidn't work. didn't hold her attention, perhaps she was too old...  13 months.but it was cheap.",0
Gorgeous little light for my daughter's room. I had an electrician hard wire it into the ceiling for me. Perfect size for a bedroom & bright enough too. Everyone who sees her room compliments this light and every mother wants one for her daughter. I especially loved that the light came preassembled and even included the light bulbs.,1
"We've had this crib for 6 months now and love it. Our son has used it since we brought him home from the hospital after he was born. The crib was easy to assemble and re-assemble as we've recently moved. It feels very sturdy and the finish is a beautiful, light honey color. We also have the matching changing table/dresser. My only issue with that item is one of the drawer front's kept falling off. I highly recommend this crib. It's good quality especially for the price....as of July 12,2009 the crib is still holding up well to a very active 21mo old boy. Great investment!",1
Wow fastes shipment ever came in perfect condition i cant wait to set it up for my little one!! Thanks a lot will do business again!!>,1
"I purchased this because I needed a bag for daycare to tote diapers and my baby's food for the day. I can fit 3 wide mouth bottles (Born Free) in, but I have to struggle to zip it shut. If you also need to pack baby food, this won't work for you unless your bottles are slender. I decided to purchase another bag for daycare and will use this bag for my own lunch.",0
"My granddaughter is now sleeping in here own bed, thank again for the low price and great shopping,  She loves it",1
Adding the extension set seemed to almost double the play space inside the enclosed area.This converts the starting set from a 6 sided to a full 2 x 2 square.Attaches easily and sturdy.,1
Overall good product.  The clarity is good and I like the zoom feature on the camera.  The battery life on the monitor is short.  The real annoying thing is the beeping that this thing makes.  I can't stop it.  I thought the models sold by amazon after March 2014 should have a way to disable this beeping but my manual does not mention this.  I am awaiting response from manufacturer.,1
"I love this product! My daughter loves to toss her binky and this helped keep it in. Her little legs always ended up using the standard bumper as a foot rest with her foot hanging out of the slats and this has stopped that so far. She loves to scoot right up to the corner of the crib too and with this bumper I do not worry as much about suffocation. It looks good and was easy to install. We have a slatted crip that does not have a up and down front rail. We lower the mattress as she gets bigger. I attached the long piece bumper to the short piece to make it go all the way around with no gaps and it works great. I would recomend this to all. If you are worried about length, there is enough velcro to stretch or tighten to your desired length.",1
I don't understand why people COMPLAIN about this crib!?!? We have used ours with our son for the last 19 months with Zero problem! Some of you people need to put the screws in correctly! I love this crib and definitely would buy another and recommend it to everyone,1
"This is one of the most useful things I bought before I had my baby. The reason is simple. You don't always feel like, or have room for toting the whole diaper bag around. (like when you are just running in to grandma's house, or when you are using your umbrella stroller with the tiny basket) I keep the mesh part stocked with two diapers and the wipes case, and I grab it and go! I leave it in  my diaper bag, so its always with me in the car. I can't stress enough how useful it is! It even has a strap to attach to a stroller or hook over your wrist.When we are in a public place, especially flying, it is SO MUCH EASIER to grab this and take it to the bathroom and lay it on top of a disposable changing pad. It also has a little cushioned pillow part that I'm sure my baby appreciates.",1
"We have two children, ages three and one. Bought this for the first child and now am using it for the second child, for now. I curse the day I purchased this seat and I curse the seat each time I try to take it in or out of one of my cars.#1 This seat is too darn big.  I have to remove the car headrest for forward-facing operation, and in a rear-facing setup, the front seat has to be pulled up completely, leaving no leg room for the front seat passenger. Even after it is installed rear-facing, the seat wobbles and rocks (yes, I know how to install a car seat). For some reason, the latch belt assembly does not allow one to pull it completely taught. Also in rear-facing, if you use the tether strap, the seat then reclines at a level less than 45 degrees.  I tried it in three different cars and got the same results in each car.#2 The pull strap that allows you to snug or loosen the shoulder straps to the child is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to pull. I have a lot of upper body strength and am technically minded, I have found no way to pull this main strap to tighten the shoulder straps around my kids when the seat is installed.  It works great though if the seat is sitting on the garage floor with no child in it.#3 The SafeStop device, when properly placed in the belt line, will add too much length to the strap and not allow you to pull the shoulder straps into your child fully.I find no positive qualities to this seat. None. I would welcome any communication from the manufacturer about this. I read reviews and checked the safety claims from the maker but for me, this seat was nothing but a hassle and wish I could have my $300 back.",0
Super cute make up bag and great for travel. Just wish it were a little larger because realistically most women can't fit all their makeup in this bag.,1
"My 9 wk old likes to take naps in this bouncer. It is very soft and easy to bounce. We have been using it pretty much daily since she was born and it appears like the batteries are just now starting to go. I have not used the sounds on this much at all. The mobile is pretty boring and my baby has not spent much time looking at it. I don't like that the headrest is only attached to the seat by a strip of fabric. It kind of flops around on me when I am trying to put my baby in the seat. Also, I wish the vibrate feature lasted longer. It times out after 20 mins or so and I have to keep checking to make sure it is working. She gets bored quickly in this seat if she is awake. I think I would have rather gotten an infant rocker because those have more than one function.",1
These pacifiers are pretty to look at and it is sad that Nuk has discontinued this design.  It is very feminine and looks cute.,1
"If we want something that is going to prevent snacks from spilling 100% of the time, then we would be giving our little toddlers a welded box, or something that would be incredibly hard to clean.  Here's the skinny: My daughter, (now 18 mos) would inadvertently tip her previous snack cups/ziploc bags and dump all her cheerios out in grocery carts, parking lots, cars, etc. While frustrating for me to clean up, it was more frustrating that I had thought ahead of time to bring a snack, and after 5 minutes, she's bored in the cart/car/stroller, and I have no way to combat it at this point. A grocery clerk told me about these, and we left that store to pick up a two pack at toys'r us.We love them, here's why: It's washable. The lid is soft, so it doesn't scratch her hand (as our old plastic ones did). It's easy for her to get her snacks out of it, (she used to get mad when her hand would get stuck in our half moon lid snack cup, or she couldn't get those last few cheerios out of a snack cup), it does prevent nearly all the snacks from escaping when she turns it upside down, or throws it, or when it falls out of the diaper bag or my purse. I don't have to close the lid, because it's always closed.What I've noticed: Yes, she figured out how to take the top off, BUT, I use this as the ace up my sleeve.  It's especially great for when we find ourselves grocery shopping because we're out of milk, and I have a hungry, tired, grouchy baby, and need something to entertain her for 15-20 minutes so we can get to the car peacefully. While she has figured how to get the lid off by herself, it has never come off by itself (very important). My parents asked for my second snack trap when they saw how great this one was. They have no complaints. Also, she figured out how to stick her hand into it, and scoop a few snacks on the petals of the lid, so that when it tips, she has the potential to lose a dozen cheerios, but, she only does it when she's bored of eating.Ultimately I've noticed when she is finished eating, no matter where she is, she tries to disassemble/throw whatever she's eating out of.So, buy this, you will appreciate it, if your expectations are realistic.",1
I think that this is one of the best product out on the market and that all new patents should be introduced to it!,1
"Bought this for a surprise for my wife for the baby shower. She loves it, she has been wanting this ever since we started looking for baby items.stiching is very uniform and nice, color and feel of the material is &#34;rich&#34;, nice feeling. She hasn't used this for the baby yet, but everything so far is great.Not only is it great quality bag but we got it on a discount and was very very happy with amazon on that amazing deal.Would recommend to any mom that enjoys a nice looking bag but also very functional as well.",1
This thing is a gimmick.  It will end up in your next garage sale. Your back will hurt in no time.,0
"Huge. Can be taken apart and used in multiple places at once if you don't need to make a giant baby playpen. Cheaper then buying multiple ones for different locations. A little difficult to take apart, but it's sturdy.",1
"We tried several sippy cups before this one, none of them worked.  Half the time I couldn't figure out how to get milk through the fancy, spill proof 'straws'.  This cup was an instant success with our 11 month old.  He literally grabbed it and started drinking.  It was as easy as that. I highly recommend this product.",1
"My babies loved this. The only negative is that you have to wash it frequently as they drool over it. I'd suggest two, because while the cleanliness is an issue both of my kids loved it so much it would have been worth it to have a couple to rotate and wash on a daily basis. They loved the crinkly aspect and it was removeable for easy washing at least.",1
"Sheet is fine. Hard to match size of bassinet with size of mattress, and size of sheet. Seems like it should be easier!",0
"These are exactly as described. They do exactly what you need them to do. They are easy to use. The only thing I would note is that the teeth that catch the fabric are on the sharp side. They wouldn't cut you but they would be uncomfortable digging into baby's skin. So it's important to be sure there is thick enough fabric or multiple layers where you place them. But that's more user error than a problem with the product, so still 5 stars.",1
I wouldn't use any other brand of car seat. Downsized to the Britax Boulevard for my mom's car because the extra side air pillows made the seat to wide for the backseat of her CRV (we have to get three kids in the back). This seat fits perfectly without sacrificing the high standards for safety that Britax provides.,1
Great product! We use it for our second child and have no complains!!!We will buy this item again from here no doubt!!,1
"These finger guards work great and have lasted for many years now!  We use them for our children's bedrooms and hallway bathroom, to keep them from slamming doors shut and pinching fingers.  I especially like the feature of being able to &#34;disable&#34; it by simply turning it 90 degrees without taking the guard off the door frame, to let you close the door when needed.  The adhesive was not strong enough, so we just secured ours with screws, which I think was included (if not, just buy some at the hardware store).",1
"lives upto to its rating as the most secured and safe baby car seat ..sturdy,safe, light weight,easy to carry,easy to fold and unfold using one hand,good color combination..our baby loves it!4 star as the basket has less space and the space to access the bag is little narrow.",1
"The cover with the zipper was so easy to use, and I was able to put on the cover in less than 2 minutes. The color you get is what you see in the picture. I've heard other snoogle covers that don't have the zippers are a pain to put on, so I considered this one, and I am quite happy with the purchase. I've only had it for a month or 2 now, so I don't know how good the quality is yet, but so far so good!",1
This piggy bank is really cute and just the right size.  It's a gift for my nephew and his wife who are expecting a baby girl.,1
"NOT UP TO CODE REQUIREMENTS, But this will give you peace of mind when you have little ones around. The installation will require some modification and because of screen pulling together. If you drill holes side to side instead of using pre-drilled it will work fine. Be patient, the trial and error method may be more helpful then the instruction.",1
These are very easy to use and get the job done quickly.  I have a pair of clippers for my toddler and I purchased a second pair for my newborn.  They cut through both nails with ease.  The second pair did not come the color shown but arrived green.  I was actually happy about this as I wanted to keep them separate.  I've had the first pair for going on three years with no issue.  Great little tool!  They get ALOT of use as my guys nails grow at record speed!,1
"The idea of this product is genius! I had a hard time trying to hold both lines up while pumping, especially having twins, with my hands. Maybe it is just the size of my breasts right now, but I never really got a good, tight fit... enough so that I felt like my pumping was getting maximum results. I found I was always holding one of the bottles up as I pumped just to make sure I had the strongest suction. I tried the L and XL. I still think that it was worth the money to get this though. Especially if you have to double pump.",0
Great price!  Works great!  No problem with it!  My daughter love it.,1
"The first one I ordered ripped along the seam, but it was exchanged no problem. I recommend having two, because if one gets ""messed,"" unless you go in and wash it with soap and water its pretty much done...",1
"Despite the way it looks, you won't have anywhere to rest your head and the arm rests seemed too far apart. The upholstery, on the other hand, was fantastic. After we assembled it, and checked to make sure we had tighten all the bolts enough, it still slightly wobbled. It did work well enough to get our baby daughter asleep easily.",0
"I bought this bag 5 months ago before my daughter was born. She is only four months and we have used it a handful of times. it is a cute messenger bag but the quality is very very poor. The pouches to place things have already broken and frayed. I am really really disappointed by the quality. I am also not happy with the customer service for despite calling them and sending them an email, I have not heard back.",0
"I'm reading all the negative reviews and giggling as I do it!!  This is probably the easiest product I've ever used and I'm shocked at the amount of people who cannot figure it out. (O.k. I guess I'm really not too shocked.) Anyway, to make the directions quick and easy: DON'T TWIST THE VERY TOP OF THE DIAPER GENIE UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO CHANGE IT!!  THIS CAUSES IT TO CUT THE BAGS INSIDE AND IF YOU'RE NOT READY FOR THAT IT DOES BECOME A MESS.  Geez people, read the directions before jumping into something.This product is great and has kept away the odor in my daughter's room.",1
"A very wise friend gifted the Mustela starter set to me a few years ago for my shower and while I used mostly all of the products fully, this particular product wasn't included at the time, thus prompting me on my very expensive and disappointing quest to find the ultimate baby bathing products. Let's be clear: you certainly can use J&J;, Burt's Bees, Aveeno, Angel Baby, California Baby, Pretentious Baby or whatever you like without my judgment, as this review isn't an homage to all things green and organic. It's in fact quite the contrary. While I can appreciate why that is important to many, after 3 years of testing products, both organic and otherwise; I've come full circle with my original gut instinct: organic products simply can't get done the same job that ""formulated"" products can. I am sorry to all the tree loving moms out there, but I have found this to be true with both my husband and my products as well as our kids.Sorry...I digress. Back to the product review.This product, and all others by this maker, are head and shoulders above the rest. Here's why:1. The scent. It's perfect, heavenly and lingers on both of my kids until the next bath rolls around. I have actually found that their body heat intensifies the smell.2. It cleans. It also lathers beautifully. Not to say that indicates it's cleaning (as I've been told it doesn't) but truth be told, I'm old school here. Good lather = good clean.3. Rinses easily and leaves hair soft, shiny and tangle free.4. It lasts. no pumps, just squeeze a small amount in your hand, rub your hands together and apply. As other reviewers have pointed out, a little goes a long way.4. While I cannot speak to it's chemical composition, sadly I admit that it's French, so, uh, I trust it.Overall, run don't walk to grab this one and save money by ending your quest to find the perfect cleanser.",1
"Is it worth it?  With so many inexpensive teethers on the market in all shapes and sizes, why is this one so popular?  Yes, it's trendy.  Yes, the celebrities all have these for their babies.  Yes, it's European.  But is it really worth the price for your baby?That's the question I've been asking myself ever since receiving Vulli Sophie the Giraffe as a gift from a well-meaning (and much-hipper-than-I-am) friend.  My answer is a qualified ""yes.""  Here are the benefits.  This teether is several inches tall, making it larger than many other teethers.  Also, it has a lot of appendages (four legs and a long neck).  These features make it easy for my uncoordinated baby to hold on to this teether.  That's a big benefit.  Also, the shape of the legs and head result in a variety of teething choices.  My baby prefers to grip the teether by the legs and to chew on the giraffe's ears or nose.  I've seen other babies who prefer to chew on the front or back legs.  One baby I know even prefers to chew on the giraffe's rump.  With so many choices, your baby is bound to discover one that she/he likes.  Additionally, the teether makes a squeaky sound when squeezed (think about a traditional dog squeaky toy).  My baby likes this sound (as do my dogs).  Finally, the all-rubber surface of this teether makes it easy to clean.  These are the benefits.Here are the downsides.  The rubber on this teether is a bit stinky and definitely has a taste that my baby isn't thrilled about.  She's willing to put up with it, but I can tell that the taste isn't as pleasant to her as that of some of her other teethers.  Also, this teether doesn't have any rough patches or bumps, and those bumps are soothing to babies with serious teething going on.  Finally, this teether costs double or triple what other teethers cost, and that's a big downside if you're buying this for your own baby.  So, weigh the pros against the cons and make a decision if this teether is right for you.",1
"My nephew loves them and uses them every meal which means that they are washed multiple times per day. So far, they are showing no wear.",1
"I hear the upgrade to this product includes an app that controls a seat warmer, a flush function, and a FaceTime-like video chat feature. Sweet!",0
"I paid half this price at Target and was very pleased with this product. Bought it because baby kept spitting up whenever I'd lay her flat in her cradle, so she slept in this for the first three weeks and we were all happier for it. Plus it doesn't take up very much floor space, which is great if you're trying not to fill your home with mountains of baby clutter.",1
"I bought this for my 4 month old daughter.  She kept staring at it as soon as it was put in front of her.  Its near on impossible for a young baby to get a tune out of the arms (more for adult than even a one year old), but all the same, its brought lots of amusement, has a lovely vanilla scent to it and my daughter gets very excited when I play 'twinkle little star' to her on it.  She's now nearly 6 months and its one of her favourite toys.  She also tends to frequently lay on her tummy talking to him, always goes towards him when on her playmat and plays with his black and white frills on each arm. Money well spent as when other children come round they also seem to take a shine to it, ranging from 2 year olds to 5 year olds!  Another great toy from Lamaze.",1
"This product seems like more of an afterthought rather than a safe way to carry an infant in an Ergo Baby Carrier.  The only time I can get my 7 week daughter to sit in it without crying is when she's sleeping already.  She seems too long to sit in the heart2heart insert ""frog style"" (she HATES ""frog style""), yet too short to have her legs spread a part in the carrier, even with the insert.  Her poor legs just seem too cramped!The instructions are also COMPLETELY unclear when it comes to using the insert.  I can't tell at all if I'm positioning her in the insert correctly and the instructions don't give clear details on what's safe for an infant when using the insert.  I tried to research what's safe/unsafe as far as positioning infants in the insert but there's nothing to be found.  My conclusion:  instructions are unclear and not detailed because even Ergobaby is unsure of how to use this product and how to use it SAFELY.I'm going to go with the K'tan wrap until she's big enough for the ergo without the insert.  I'm sure the carrier works great (I've heard RAVE reviews on the carrier, but just not with the insert).  Ergobaby tried creating a solution for infant use of their carriers, not once, but twice, and still didn't get it right.  I would highly recommend NOT using the ergo carrier if you have to use the insert--just doesn't seem safe).  Wait until there's a sure safe way to have infants seated in the carrier.  I'm returning mine until my daughter's big enough for the carrier without the insert.",0
"We got this Roundabout because my son outgrew his infant car seat. We have a Britax Marathon for my older daughter and I am completely impressed with it. I thought the only difference between the Roundabout and the Marathon was going to be the difference in weight limits. Boy was I wrong. The quality is not what I'd expect from Britax. It's hard to recline, all of that is a cheap plastic too, not like the hard plastic the Marathon has. Even the shoulder pads on the straps are cheaper, they velcro around the straps and fall off all the time. I'm just not impressed.  Spend the extra $50 or so and get the Marathon, it's worth it.",0
"Needed a gate to keep our 3 rescue dogs from rushing the front door when visitors come.  Works great.  If you have a wide area to block off you will need another person to help you set it up as the pieces come apart too easily.  Once installed, it was wonderful and worked great for the purpose we purchased it.  Much better than the wooden gate we were using that we had to step over all the time to enter the room - having the swing gate opening is a life saver!!!!  Personally I would like a slightly larger width to the swing gate area but I've gotten use to angling my body as I pass through.",1
"The playpen is large and spacious,perfect for babies to roll around and play in. My only gripe is if the baby were to puke on the mat there's no way to wash the entire thing, just spot clean.  To solve this problem one has to buy a covering/sheet to cover the playpen surface.  Sheets are hard to find, and expensive to purchase and ship. But on a positive note the playpen is sturdy and easy to assemble.",1
"We absolutely love this chair...especially for the price! It's very sturdy and doesn't even budge when I lean on it. We'll be leaving it in our trunk in the handy carry case it came in for trips to the grandparents, etc... Very very happy with our purchase! Our daughter loves sitting in it too!",1
"This is a good extra stroller, for times when you need something lightweight and portable.",1
"This is a great toy, but my daughter only used it about 4 times before it stopped working. Since the price has nearly doubled since I bought it in December, I decided to order it again to be sold/shipped from another seller at less than half the price. It will take 4-6 weeks. I guess this is my punishment for not wanting to pay the inflated price.",0
"I wish I'd gotten this when we first started doing bottles.  It does best if you do 28 ounces or less, but even if you have to make two batches, it's so much easier than making the bottles seperately.  It also does a much better job of mixing the formula, it seems to give it a completely different texture (in a good way).  I've read some reviews that it's flimsy.  Thruthfully, I've washed it as directed in the top of the dishwasher and had no issues.  Even if it did, I'd just shell out another 10..it's a small price for the ease it provides.",1
"Easy to attach, soft and long. Much better than the straps of the car seat rubbing on my sons neck.",1
"The stool works fine for my toddler. However, if you have a smaller bathroom it takes up a lot of room and if your husband is using that bathroom as well.... he hates it because it sticks out far enough that he has to move it in order to stand close enough to the toilet. I am ordering a regular rectangle stool so that it can be simply kicked to one side if needed. Also, little pricey for a hunk of plastic.",0
"We bought this item and everything looked fine. Then we attended a Baby CPR and Safety Class at our local hospital and learned that this product might be preventing SIDS, but itself constitutes a suffocation hazard!Even the American SIDS Institute says on their website (sids.org):""Place infants to sleep in a baby bed with a firm mattress. There should be nothing in the bed but the baby - no covering, no pillows, no bumper pads and no toys. Soft mattresses and heavy covering are associated with the risk for SIDS.""Please think, before you buy. Thank you!",0
"I bought this cup so I could insert a picture of my 2 year-old daughter's favorite cartoon characters, in order to entice her to drink her milk from a straw cup instead of her soft-spout sippy-cup.  The first thing I did upon receiving this product was check the packaging to see whether the plastic cup was BPA-free.  There was no mention of this cup being BPA-free on the packaging, and I couldn't find a recycle code/number on the bottom of the cup.  (Recycle code ""7"" often identifies polycarbonate plastic, the worst culprit for containing BPA).  This cup was discontinued by Playtex a few years ago, before parents and the general public became fully aware of the dangers of exposing babies and young children to BPA.  Plus the product packaging seemed a bit dated, so I figured that there was a good chance this cup contained BPA.  It just wasn't worth the risk to me, so I returned the cup.  If this cup is in fact BPA-free, it should be clearly stated on the product packaging so parents can make an informed buying choice.Grade: C-",0
I bought this as an emergency my pump broke and i was waiting for my replacement to arrive.Its slow to take you milk and it hurts. i would recommend to spend your money on ameda or medela pump it worth it. It a cheap price so I guess you get what you pay for.,0
"Replacement parts work like a charm! Super good price would buy again. Only thing I don't care for is that they are blue and not clear. No biggie, I didn't dock a star for the color.",1
"Our daughter loves this jumparoo, it can hold her attention for hours on end. We dident think all of the toys were super exiting, however. The Tiger that is suposed to play peekaboo just did not impress. Other than that, this jumperoo has been an excellent activity center for our child.",1
"I am a mom of two boys, a three year old and a 2 month old and this is by far my favorite diaper bag yet. It is stylish but also highly functional. I love that backpack option because as a mom of two, I normally need one hand for the carseat or stroller and the other to hold on to my three year old. I also love that the entire bag can just be wiped clean. There are two pockets on the inside for bottles which are easy to get to when you need a bottle ASAP. In the inside there is a hook for your keys and a tiny zipper pocket so you can keep your wallet or other small items from getting lost in the bag. In the front of the bag is a fold out diaper changing pad which is really convenient. I do wish there was a small pocket in the back for an iPad or for papers, but other than that I have no complaints on this bag at all! LOVE IT!",1
"I bought this hello kitty mug as a gift for my 4 year old niece. I thought it was just for little kids, but when I got it, I feel like keeping them. It's cute & pretty & when she tried it, there's no drip when you hold it sideways. The lid snug & fit. This is a good buy.",1
"Very light to handle.  Very convenient, and just the perfect size.  The only thing I am not 100% pleased with is the separaters underneath (and attached to) the tray.  It's a bit easy to squeeze a leg, but it's a nice safety feature as well.",1
"I purchased the Boppy BEFORE I had my baby and thought that the Boppy would be the practical purchase as I could use it to breastfeed and then as a pillow for baby to sit in when she was older. The Boppy was the worst for breastfeeding. I went to a lactation specialist and used the Brest Friend. Wow, it so much easier and better to nurse with than the Boppy. The BF didn't slide around and create gaps between me and the pillow. Baby was at the correct height for breast feeding and it was easier to move her around on.The only negative I have about the BF is the cover. The soft fabric makes me sweat a lot (I live in a warmer climate)! I was going to order a cotton cover but I read reviews that the cotton material is thin and fluids (breast milk, potty and spit up!) will easily soak through the cover and into the foam material. If that happens then you have a smelly BF and I don't want to strap that onto me every few hours if it stinks.I would recommend this to other mothers before I would recommend the Boppy.",1
"These are really great books.  They have bright colors, they are the perfect size for small hands, and they are easily wiped clean.  My 4 month old son loves them!  I got them at the dollar store for a dollar a piece.  I love shopping on Amazon, but this time I am really disappointed with this  ridiculous price!!!",0
Fast shipping and as described! They are a little big for my 10 month old but she seems to like them none the less.,1
For the arrival of my first child I wanted a beautiful bedset without all the pink! When I saw this set online I instantly fell in love with it. But since looks can be deciving on the internet I went to the store to check it out and put it on my registry right away.Its very beautiful and so far i have had no problems with it.Anouther person stated that the quilt was a bit miss-stitched and I have seen the same thing on mine as well other than that its just wonderful.Although I wish the valance was sheer instead of thick material.,1
Works well. But make sure the door you are going to use it for actually has handles on each door so that these can go through. If the doors have just knobs these dont work very well and my kid figured out how to pry this out from 2 knobs immediately,1
"I regestered for this before relizing this site did ratings on products. When I received it at my shower I was delighted. That was till I set it up threw the box away and tried to use it. Horrible!!  The static was so loud it kept my husband and I awake. I ended up having to shut it off, which meant I still didn't sleep.(Neverous new mom) My son does enjoy the light show. That's the only good use I get from it. I was really shocked that this monitor was so badly made.  Fisherprice usually makes wonderful products. I ended up getting Fisherprice's Sound and Lights monitor. This one's extremely better made and less expensive. No light show, but now mommy can sleep.",0
"Nothing like the photo portrays. It is made of cheap, thin foam and was folded up for shipping in a way that caused bends (thus huge gaps) in the material that is supposed to go around the head. The gaps make it useless and the flimsy material wouldn't really keep water off anyway.",0
LOVE IT! LOVE IT! JUST LOVE IT!  FIRST TIME MOM LIFE SAVER. BEST MONEY SPENT.  I GOT IT WHEN GIANNA WAS ONE MONTH. SHE LOVED IT SINCE THE FIRST TIME I GOT HER IN IT AND SEVEN MONTHS LATER SHE STILL DOES.,1
"We bought this just for travel purposes. For a couple years we've traveled extensively with our big bulky stroller and while that was great for holding carry-ons, it was a pain to move around.So this one is fine for what we use it for: quick trips to the park, moving our two year old around the airport and to toss in the back of the car just in case we need it at the mall.It is a rough ride and kind of squashes him on the sides (he's now 31 pounds) but like I said, it is not our main stroller. I'm 5'5"" and I find the handles to be at an awkward height but my 5'11"" husband thinks it is fine. We live in CA so being able to fold up the back for a little air circulation is handy but not used so often.I would definitely recommend this if you need to save money or have need for a good quality cheap stroller.",1
This changing pad is splash proof and convenient to carry around the house. Great for sun bathing our new born baby which had slight jaundice in her first weeks. Double up as an impromptu baby cot anywhere in the house. Move the baby without disturbing her.,1
"Lost a couple of these disks and ordered the replacement six pack. Now I have plenty of extras, just in case. Product arrived quickly and in great condition.",1
"I would recommend this to anyone! It is so cute and perfect for my little Maddie! The only thing extra I am doing to it is adding a little more stuffing to the pillows. I am truly amazed I got all this for that price! The material rocks, so soft, and so many different textures, and vibrant colors! A definite win on my part!",1
I love this pack n play because its SOOOOOOOOOOO spacious.  My son loves the little bugs and can lay in it for a while (4 months old).  I think as he gets older he'll enjoy playing in it and I'll feel good because I know its a safe place for him to be.  Would recommend.,1
"Exactly what I was looking for.  I use it in the church nursery. Easily assembled, light weight, safe, and very reasonably priced. Arrived promptly and in great condition.",1
"First I would like to say that times have certainly changed.  When my oldest was a baby (1995) the best monitors were ridden with static and not very sensitive.  This model however, provides incredible sound quality with ZERO static or interference.  I have a two story house with a full basement and this monitor provided crystal clear sound even across three floors of the house.  I also have two different cordless phone systems and a wireless-B network, and none of that interfered with this monitor at all.For me, 99% of the value of an item like this lies in its clarity and performance (which as I mentioned are excellent).  The added features like built-in music, intercom feature, etc are simply icing on the cake.This is a pricey item but the performance justifies the hype and the cost.",1
"My only complaint is that the dial to tighten the seat onto the toilet keeps jerking back, preventing the seat from being truly secure. However, we are still using it and it doesn't move when my son is on it",0
"Was wary after mixed reviews.  So far this item has probably saved me about 50$ that I would have spent on batteries.  Makes pumping in the car so easy!  Construction seems a little cheap, but a month in and no issues thus far!",1
"We took a family trip last summer in which we drove for several hours each day and we are so glad we purchased this for our 12 month old daughter.  This pillow offered support and stoped that uncomfortable neck slump while she slept in the car, and it stayed in place!  It worked so good we keep it in the car and use it anytime we think our daughter might fall asleep in the car.",1
Absolutely needed for anyone who has a baby or child car seat in their vehicle.  It stays in place because there is a flap of the mat that slips down between the seat and back.  It prevents all dents and/or tears that might occur from the car seat. It is also very easy to wipe off when spills occur.  Very easy to remove if used by grandparents who only have a car seat in their vehicle for occasionally use.,1
I have single hung windows with metal frames.  I guess they're aluminum but I was unable to drill the necessary holes.  I used a new bit but the main problem was that the space I needed to reach into to drill was too deep.  Maybe an extra long bit would have worked but I don't own one so I just tossed the locks in the trash.  I'm going to buy the tried and true kind of lock that clamps on the edge of the window frame using thumb screws.,0
"Purchased for our first daughter and did lots of research. I found this crib on Walmart.com, but it was cheaper on Amazon (Thanks! Amazon). It is gorgeous! Very very very sturdy. SOOOO easy to put together. My daughter is now 19 months and its in great condition. Still looks new. It's not solid black, it has more of an antique finish i guess. It basically has little chips and scratches to give it a worn look. It's not very noticeable until you get up close. It's my favorite part though. It does scratch and it just looks like it's suppose to be like that. I cant wait to have more kids and buy this again, but maybe in white =)",1
Beautiful bright colors !  Very cushiony for comfort on babies knees.  There isn't any odor like mostvinyls.,1
A great product! I loved not having to worry if my baby would fall over and hit the tub. It provided a soft comfy barrier. And she loved that it was a duck. It's so wonderful for that price. And it really is a great transition to the big bath tub.A definite must buy.,1
"My baby really loves the music from the mobile. It helps me with naptime. Some reviews have blasted this item for being too loud, which it is, VERY loud, but that can be fixed simply by putting a piece of scotch tape over the speaker. My only complaint is that there is no stop timer. The thing will play forever, so you have to sneak back into sleeping baby's room and press the red button. Mildly annoying",1
I BOUGHT TWO OF  THIS CAR  SEAT  FOR MY  TWIN BOYS.  THEY  LOVED IT LOOK  GREAT  AND  IT IS  VERY  SOFT  AND  DURABLE.,1
"Trying to get the boogies out of my 5 month old's nose has always been a struggle as she has very narrow nasal passages. When she used to see the bulb approaching her face she would immediately start fussing and squirming about. When we first tried out the Nosefrida, she pretty much had the same reaction, but it has progressively improved and she now thinks its a game and will grab the tube to try and &#34;help&#34; me. It's efficient, easy to clean, and non-invassive (unlike the bulb syringe). I would definitely recommend this product to others (after explaining that boogies don't actually get into your mouth, of course).",1
"These trays are nice, but the lids don't fit very snug.  Once the food freezes though, I stick them in labeled Ziploc baggies. If you want snug lids, I recommend Tupperware brand ice cube trays.  Also keep in mind that if you are making foods that don't freeze solid (like apricots and prunes), it is impossible to remove the food in these trays.  For those foods, I recommend flexible trays and just carefully wrap plastic around it.  Overall, great price though and it does work good enough for me.  But because of the lids, I won't rate it higher.",0
My Grandson is super fussy and I used this for my own son. Put my Grandson in this turned on the vacuum and he was out like a light! He looked just like he was back in the womb!Thank goodness I still had this as it is no longer available. What a great product!,1
"I loved the pattern, but the stitching began to come apart after only a couple of washes. I have another boppy cover that I don't like as much, but the stitching has held on it and I've had it much longer-- maybe just a random defect?",0
"We also have the valco seat pockets for winter. When we get all three of our toddlers in the stroller and cover them with the rain protector, they stay dry and warm. It blocks the wind. That is great. Yesterday we had to go to our dentist appointment . We live in NYC, so we loaded everyone up, winter hats and gloves and took off. It was 13 degrees. The kids were great.",1
"I JUST LOVE THIS BOTTLES AND MY 2 WEEK OLD BABY DOES TOO. THEY ARE SUPER EASY TO FILL DURING DOES LATE NIGHT FEEDINGS BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE OPENING, EVEN IF YOU ARE HALF A SLEEP. VERY CONFORTABLE TO GRAB. I HAVEN'T HAD PROBLEMS WITH ANY LEAKING, WE JUST LOVE THEM.",1
"The mechanism that locks and unlocks the gate is hard to set, making this frustrating to install and hard to move.  It seems sturdy though, although my daughter can unlock it by reaching over (but thats with any of these gates).  It is more durable than the wooden gates, which snap after a while.  Recommend, with adequate supervision.  Also, keep the lock on the other side from curious babies and toddlers.",0
"I bought this for my baby when she was 5 months old and she LOVES it. She can stay in there and jump around for hours. Although once she started being more mobile, she's a little less happy being in the jumper for long. But still, when she's in there jumping around, she is very happy. Happy Baby = Happy mommy.It's sturdy and holds up well. She's a very vigorous jumper! I wish there were more interactive toys though because I think by the time she turns 1, the jumper will no longer appeal to her anymore. It is a bit pricey for it's use life. If you have the money, I say buy this jumper. If not, buy the cheaper jumpers out there. I think it still serves the same purpose?",1
"This Diaper baby bag is PERFECT!!!! Its big enough to hold everything I would need for my baby, and more than enough room for my other child items instead of bringing two bags. Its fashionable. And all the pockets inside is a added bonus.",1
Made of good materials. It is very soft for my 2-month old baby boy. It fits tightly with the wrist-band. It helps preventing my baby boy scratch his face. I would recommend it to any parents.,1
I absolutely love this travel chair.  I always use it in the shopping cart whenever I go shopping.  My daughter is 6 months old and starting to outgrow her carseat so we bought her a convertible carseat.  The major drawback with this is that I can no longer put the carseat on the cart when I shop and she's not quite old enough to sit in the cart without falling over.  This travel seat makes it possible to shop easy again.  My daughter feels like a big girl sitting up and being able to look around and has so much more fun than when she is in her car seat.  This is a great idea.  I love it.,1
This is by far my daughter's favorite toy! She loves the bright colors and the sound it makes. Just make sure you follow the directions & don't put it in the washing machine like I did because it will ruin the mirror.,1
"I have the old model Diaper Genie and am sooo glad to have one!  A few comments:1. Some people claim the refills are too expensive. We get them at WalMart for less than $5 each and each one has lasted more than a month, even with a 7-month-old who poops like it's an Olympic sport. $5 a month is worth it for the convience of not having to change it as much as you would with a garbage bag - which are probably about as expensive.2. Some people say it smells - I can't believe that.  Even with our baby eating solid foods and making hideously stinky poops, there is NO odor in our nursery.  Not even a little!!  I empty it every 7-10 days and there is never, ever an odor coming from it, even when I am sitting next to it playing on the floor with the baby. UPDATE: We switched to the Toddler strength or Stage 2 refills at about 9 months as he started to eat more ""real"" food - still no odors!I love that the Genie is easy to use, easy to empty and refill and that there is no smell at all. We don't use it for wet-only diapers and I would recommend it to everyone with an infant.",1
"We bought many little toddler spoons for my 18 month old...and this by far is the best one. The short and thick handles make it easier for her to grip...thus making it easier for her to actually scoop some food into her mouth successfully :) The fork could be a bit longer--but then it's super safe and I am not worried about her poking herself.Overall, we love it!",1
"I was using the stroller of my Graco travel system until my son was about 13 months, then I finally decided to get him a new one. My son loves his Britax carseat, so I figured they'd have great strollers as well. I couldn't believe how amazingly easy it was to fold it compared to our Graco one. I absolutely love it! And, it's a lot easier to navigate. The second I put my son in it, he had a huge smile on his face. Definitely worth buying.",1
I couldn't be more happier with this bed . It is made very well and the side rails are great from preventing my child from rolling off the bed in the middle of the night . It folds up small enough to take on road trips and it very easy to set up. this is a great buy.,1
"My son hated this bib. He is into mushing anything and everything into his face and when I put this bib on him, he did just that. He screams every time I put it on but does just fine with regular cheap soft bibs. We will definitely be returning this.",0
"This is very nice and well made.But the price? Get real, it needs to cost about 30% of what they're asking.",0
"Odd scent, small and wimpy wipes. For poopy diapers you'll need at least three. Love 7th Generation diapers, but moving on from the wipes.",0
Put the bed together with ease and my daughter loves it. We later decorated it up a little bit with the wall stickers to give it some more style.,1
"My baby loves these snack cups. Great for Cheerios and puffs and creates a challenge for them when they're little trying to figure out how to get them out of there. Great value for the money and we like them much more than the gerber ones, the small snacks seem to stay in these much better. Only wish there was a different lid you could put in them to seal it overnight.",1
"I ordered this for my sister. A few days after i placed the order she called and said it had already arrived shocking us both how fast it shipped. She loves the stroller and is very happy with this purchase. Her older daughter doesn't like being in the back seat, so the baby rides in the back, but everything works great and its really handy.",1
Both of the cups I purchased leak! I do not recommend this product. I have two kids and I have tried many different dippy cups and this is by far the worse we have tried.,0
My little one LOVES these !! These are the best thing ever made. This is the only pacifier he will use. I think we have at least 4 wubbanubs:) I just ordered the lamb one for when he is baptized. These also wash very nice too! They are very easy to find in a diaper bag and when my little one wakes up he just puts it back in his mouth. He has no problem finding it. I don't know it we could live without it:)!!!!,1
"These seem to be a sturdy long use product. Unfortunately there are a couple design issues. First, the side flaps with velcro are molded in such a way that when you undo the diaper they instantly fall into the dirty diaper unless you fold them under and hold them there which can be really tough with a screaming and squirming baby. This means the enclosure area gets dirty very easily so you can't reuse the diaper for many wears without washing. Secondly, the material stains easily. If you don't want to use bleach (we can't, gives the baby a rash), your diapers will look dirty even when they are clean.",0
"I got this for him around 4 months, at the time he didn't too much care for it. Now that his hand coordination is better he loves it!!!!",1
"Idea and design are good but my 18 month old can't get any water out of the firm plastic top.  I even tried and it would take an industrial vacuum to suck liquid out.  Very disappointed, especially given the other good reviews.",0
"We received this swing as a gift for our baby shower. We thought of getting the Ocean Wonders Aquarium cradle swing, but decided that it would be more valuable and useful if we bought something that we could take with us when we went places. Plus this does not take up as much space as the cradle swing and with two dogs and a bunch of baby gear already around the house, this just seemed like the logical choice. It was a great decision. Our son absolutely loves this swing. Since day one, he has loved listening to the music and watching the lights. He starts to cry when his music has stopped. Now that he is 4 1/2 months old, he is grabbing for the fish on the side and has started to activate the music by pulling on it.The swing is easy to put together and easy to take with. We absolutely love this swing.",1
"I really want to LOVE this cup. I love the design, I love that it is transparent, I love that there are masurements marked on the side, I love the handles, and I love that it can easily convert to a straw or &#34;big boy&#34; cup. There are two big problems, however, which keep this from being 5 stars.First, the lid is HARD to screw on. It's designed so that the spout is always directly lined up with the measurements-- but this means a lot of fiddling before the lid fits on properly. It's not ideal when you have a tired cranky toddler who just wants his cup of milk.Second, the valve is CONSTANTLY popping out of the lid. Usually this only happens when there are temperature changes (putting warm milk into a cold cup, or allowing cold water to come to room temperature), but it is still a HUGE pain.And here's a &#34;bonus&#34; con if you will: it's non-microwaveable. Full confession: I DO use it in the microwave (without the lid) usually for 20 seconds at a time (just to bring milk to room temperature), and I haven't had any problems, but I'd be a lot happier if it was marked microwave safe.All this being said, I do really like this cup. It's easy to clean, easy to see how much liquid is left (and what kind of liquid it is), and I love the handles. I lust wish the lid was easier to use, and the valve would stay in place.",1
This little gym has been a great benefit to us in keeping our child curious and active. It is simple but effective. Everything can be moved around and we take the mirror and other pieces and place them on the car seat when we travel. Very nice and useful for several situations. Would definitely recommend for infants.,1
"My daughter was teething hard. She was always trying to chew on my jewelry. Came across this, bought it and she loves it. She can wear on her wrist and teeth on it. It's soft too. Great buy",1
We use this all the time on walks when it is cold outside.  My daughter really likes snuggling in it when we are on walks.  It also keeps her VERY warm.,1
"I am extremely disappointed in my Peg Perego carseat and stroller.  I find them extremely difficult to use and poorly designed.  The carseat is also very heavy - much heavier than many other models - so you really don't want to have to lug it around without the stroller (which can be a monster to unfold by yourself).  I am so disappointed because I love the way these look - they are so sporty and stylish looking.  And they're also fairly expensive for this particular product so you would hope they'd be better than all the rest.  My daughter is only a month old and I am already researching bigger kid carseats and strollers for when she outgrows this one.  I'll continue to use this one and I will probably use it with any subsequent children because despite being a beast and a pain in the a**, it is also high quality and will likely last quite a long time.  Plus, like I said, I really like the way it looks.  I get so tired of the sea of navy blue stroller and carseat sets out there.  At any rate, the fact that my daughter will outgrow this in five months does not bother me - it's the fact that I have to suffer with it until then (but that is of course my choice!).  Next time around I'll be looking at Britax and McLaren - they seem to be the way to go.",0
really nice but your baby will very soon outgrow it. Get it as a baby shower item!,0
"I just tried to install this car seat for rear facing in my 2008 Subaru Outback.  I am very good mechanically and I cannot believe how difficult it is to install this seat rear facing.- The instructions are junk.  Which seems to be common with all car seats.  They are clearly written to reduce liability and not to be helpful in anyway.  They provide enough information to cover their butts, but are vague enough so you can't blame them for improper installation.- I am in agreement with all the other 1 star reviews about the angle of the seat.  The flipper on the bottom that is supposed to put this thing at a 45 degree angle is pathetic.  You should only have to put something under the seat in 10% of installations, not 100%.  I suppose if I put the seat in the bed of my pickup truck, it would work out great.- When the seat is tightened properly, it is so mashed into the back rest that you cannot access to snaps to put the cover back in place.  The strap to tighten the belts for the baby is poorly accessible.  If you leave the slack of the strap sticking up, the baby can grab it to pull on it and then loosen the belts on its own while you are driving.-  With the head rest on, the front seat has to be pushed so far forward that it puts the front passenger dangerously close to the dashboard and airbag.My wife did a ton of research to decide which car seat to buy.  After our experience of trying to install it properly and the poor fit, she was near tears.  It's obvious these seats were designed to be used by people who can afford large SUV's and minivans.  Those of us who are environmentally conscious and/or unable to afford those vehicles are left hung out to dry on trying to keep our children safe.It's no wonder why 72% of car seats are installed improperly.EDIT:  Just made a trial run with putting the baby in the seat.  Were able to remove the head rest which allowed the front seat to be better positioned.  After she gets tall enough, we will have to put that head rest back on.  Also found out that the strap tighten the belts for the baby are nearly impossible to adjust to a proper tension.",0
"I've only had this monitor for about 2 months and although the signal strength was great when I first got it, I am now having signal strength issues.  Unfortunately, the only way to reset the monitor when it freezes up is to open the back (requiring a screw driver) and unplug the camera unit.  And for whatever reason it always seems to freeze up in the middle of the night.  Not fun for a sleep deprived mother of a neonate, who just wants a few more minutes of sleep.  Motorola has been pretty good about allowing me to return the item, but that means I will be without a monitor for a couple weeks.  I bought the monitor in advance of my baby's birth so I could check it out and have everything sorted out for those very critical first few weeks after I brought the baby home.  If I didn't have an old Summer Monitor as a backup I'd be pretty devastated.",0
"This swing works well. It does not really fold up small and easy to store, but it is an excellent swing.",1
"Halo, how I love thee;) This is perfect for cold winter nights. We keep the heater off due to allergries and bundle up our little guy. He's snug as a bug.",1
"I love, love, love this pump!!  I wish so much I could have tried the different pumps before buying, because I bought the electric pump thinking it would be easier.  Then (after using it a lot), I was able to try this one and realized how much better it was.  So I ended up buying this one, too, and never use my electric anymore.  I guess I thought all manual pumps were like the ones they give you in the hospital, but they are not.  This one is so easy to use and you have to pump a long time before your hand gets tired.  Plus, you can pump and HOLD, which is something the electric pumps can't do, and I find I can get a lot more milk that way.Do yourself a favor and buy this one instead of the electric, and it'll be easier, more convenient, AND you'll save money!",1
"I was lucky enough to discover a place where you can rent a baby carrier before purchase. I did a trial with the Boba 3G, Ergo Classic, and Ergo Sport. Before the trial, I was pretty certain that I would LOVE the Ergo Sport because that specific model had a vent, detachable hood, and 3 carry positions (back, hip, and front). Well, I found the hip carry to be completely useless. It became very uncomfortable after a few minutes. I didn't like the way the strap sat on my shoulder and rubbed against my neck in that position. Also, the vent made little difference when it came to keeping the baby cool. The Ergo Classic had super soft fabric (definitely a plus) but I didn't like the hood (which is not detachable). Also the seat was a little shallow for my baby who is shaped like the cutest string bean ever.NOW THE BOBA. I LOVE that it was so easy to put on. The Boba fit me and my husband perfectly. My husband is 6' 4"" and slender and I am 5' 7"" and voluptuous (my way of saying that I still have baby weight to lose). We were both very comfortable wearing it. The carrier distributes weight very evenly and I didn't experience any back pain. I also like the way the top strap adjusts-- it easily slides up and down but is secure.  I love that it has an adjustable hood. Also, the Boba has a higher panel (deep seat), so I felt that my baby was better supported in it. I think the Boba will better accommodate her as she grows. Lastly, for the next baby, I can use the Boba without an insert (unlike the Ergo).The only minus-- I liked the fabric on the Ergo better BUT the Boba is constructed from very durable fabric and felt high quality.Overall, it's a great carrier.",1
"On the recent holiday we had friends over, she took &#34;everyone&#34; upstairs to see her room (it brought me great joy). The only thing I would prefer is if the sheets were a soft cotton. For the warmer months I'll have to find matching sheets.",1
My grandson like the telephone.Likes to listen to the sound of the telephone. I would buy another telphone like this.,1
"I LOVE the bassinet and changing table, but now my baby has transitioned to the crib portion. The mattress support is made of little more than 4 pieces of fiberboard. After sleeping in it for a month or two the mattress sags and buckles. I've attempted many times to line the boards up straight in a row, but as soon as baby lays down they get out of alignment again.",0
"We used this activity mat for the removable arches.  They are great, we put the arches almost anywhere our baby lays - the bassinet, the couch, basically any place where the arch ends can be stuffed into works to keep baby amused.  Plus the toys are attached with velco so in theory you can attach any toy that has velcro to give baby a variety of toys to view.",1
This products looks very nice in the crib but does not hold my baby's attention for very long.it is very soft even on the highest volume.,0
These are great.  I am short and the seatbelt cuts across my neck. These reposition the seatbelt to across your chest.  They are plastic and if you have an accident (and I have) they pop open.  I love them and have them in both cars in our family,1
"We have had this crib for the past 10 months and love it. It was very easy to assemble, the instructions for clear and end result was perfect. We had no problem with finding a mattress to fit the crib like others had mentioned they had. It is the perfect size and style and fits so nicely in my sons room. He loves his crib and so do we. I would recommend this crib to anyone who asks, which i've already done!",1
"The Good: Matches the Pretty Pony Crib Set and looks great, holds a decent amount of clothing, washable. The Bad: The ""frame"" of the hamper seems flimsy. I have filled up this hamper and it holds the load, BUT you can't really move it with clothes in it because the frame is not built in such a manner that it is possible. I like but would I buy it over again? Maybe for the price and the look, but definitely not if I needed a heavy duty hamper.",0
"This crib was delivered Friday afternoon. My 5 and 1/2 month old has been in a co-sleeper since birth, and we decided to move him into a crib. It took my dad and husband about an hour to put it together once all the pieces were would and counted. All the pieces were there, but two of the nuts were slightly stripped (not a big deal since it is a convertible bed and the nuts can be moved).The crib is wider than I expected, but there is plenty of room for the babe to grow into it. The bed is rock solid, and I love that it has stationary sides and comes with a side rail for the toddler bed.There are two downsides: it is darker than pictured, it looks almost black. It does seem to scratch easily, but all baby furniture will eventually!",1
My son luvs it so much...he spends anywhere between 30mins to 1 hour playing in this. We bought it when he was 5 months old. It is well built & assembly is very easy.Thanks to all reviewers for making my decision easy...,1
"I had purchased the Mini Diddie for additional storage for our new Navigator.  I purchased it from a combo deal on the Phil & Teds website which included the mini diddie bag and the hangbag.  It works great to store the doubles weather shield (rain shield) with a few diapers and a small diaper wipes container in the main compartment.  It also has an outer pocket that I use to carry a book or two.  I am a previous owner of the Bob stroller and utilized the pocket on the back of the main seat for quick accessibility items and had gotten used to that.  However, on the Navigator the isn't a pocket on the back of the seat.  You are essentially limited to the main basket for any storage, hence the diddie bag was purchased.  I do like the extra storage that the diddie bag has to offer and the ability to use it as a small crossover bag.  However I couldn't figure out how to attach it to the back of the seat as illustrated on the Phil & Teds website.  I had been dealing the Phil & Teds customer service dept (which is excellent) about another issue and found out that the diddie didn't work with the Navigator as shown on the website.  They gave me a few alternative ways to attach the bag to the stroller.  What I have done that seems to work well with the stroller in ""singles"" mode is attach/hang the diddie from the hangbag strap, then the back of the stroller seat has a ""clip"" which I have tucked the strap of the diddie bag to.  Occasionally the diddie bag strap loosens from the ""clip"" which isn't a big deal because it's secured by the hangbag, it just swings a little.  I have yet to experiment with the diddie bag with the Navigator in doubles mode but the customer service representatives stated that it fits better on the second seat.  All in all we are pleased with the extra storage space which frees up our main basket for groceries, etc.  Given the configuration issues I still would purchase this item again.",1
It fits our Graco Alano stoller just fine.  It does protect against the elements.  I feel so much better when I take my little one outside knowing she is protected against the cold and rain.  It is decently priced and received quickly.,1
"My kids are little stinkers and like to sneak out in the middle of the night and raid the fridge, or play with knives, or pretty much anything they are not supposed to do. I tried the great quality baby gates at high prices ($60 per and bought 3 total -_-) and still they could crawl over it even with vertical bars. I tried DOUBLING the gates on the same doorway, one on top of the other, but did that stop them? NO. They would crawl all the way to the top of the doorway and squeeze through the opening.  A VERY DANGEROUS AND SCARY THING FOR A MAMA.I needed a solution and this was a great, simple one. It works amazingly. Yes they can push items to the door and still release the latch but remove any furniture they can use to reach that high and actually push over there and you have a solution! I took out their lil chair and table set and now they are stuck in their room when I close the door which is a huge, HUGE relief. I highly recommend this.",1
This toy is so amazing - my friends had raved about it and so I decided to get one.  Our 3 month old doesn't have much interest in toys yet but she loves this.  It can entertain her a long time!  It's now my go-to baby shower add on gift.,1
"This is one of the bigger changing pads I've seen and I really appreciate the size now that my 5-month-old is bigger as well as more wiggly during diaper changes.  We use it a lot at home to put down before changing him since we usually just change him on the bed or the floor (even though we have a ""changing station"" set up in the nursery).  The waterproof lining provides peace of mind since anything goes when the *diapers* come off...  And we haven't had any shrinkage or other issues after throwing it in the washer and dryer a bunch of times already.I don't find it useful for when we're out and about though.  It's not padded at all so seems like it would be uncomfortable for baby on those hard plastic restroom changing tables, especially since their heads are still soft and forming.",1
"This is a great mini diaper bag. Made of quality stretchy material and is perfect for a short trip to the grocery store. The size of the pad is on the small side, but still functional.My only comlaint is the packaging - it's frustrating to open it, especially the bottom - hard for sizzors to reach. When I pulled, I broke it free, but also broke a little bit of the seam. I wonder if Infanitno would consider frustration free packaging for those kind of products - I really don't care if the box is pretty - it goes straight to the recycle bin. Pretty packaging maybe important in the store, but definitely not at Amazon.",1
"We have two children&#8230;an infant and a toddler that are a year apart.  So, the two cameras are in separate rooms.  This is the second baby monitoring system I have owned&#8230;if it wasn't so darn expensive for the monitor, camera, and extra camera, I would definitely replace it. But, we are just going to have to live with it.  Here's why I don't like it:1. The second camera is terrible.  It's just a blur on the monitor during the night. (Fine during the day)2. If you have a sound machine in your baby's room, you hear it on the monitor as well. (Not the case with my Tommie Tippie, or whatever it was)3. Battery dies very quickly, even when fully charged4. Very low range; I can't bring the monitor out into the kitchen and have it pick up my daughter's room (our house is 2400 sq ft ranch)",0
These are the only latches I found that keeps the cabinet doors completly closed so that my son cannot get his fingers pinched between the door and cabinet.  Also he will not learn to open these because the only way to open them is with the magnet key.  It can be deactivated via a switch so you can choose when the doors lock and when they stay open.  They come with doubble sided tape for installation without screws but that really does not work well since the door can be forced open easily.  I installed mines with the screws and the installation is easy.,1
We just got this stroller and so far so good. It was easy to put together and took about 10 minutes. I had a little trouble folding it up but if I put the front wheel against a wall it folds easily. The handle bar easily adjusts for both my husband and I. The one feature I really wanted we're breaks because we have a lot of hills around us and the front wheel worked great. I'm looking forward to getting a lot of use out of this stroller.,1
"This diaper caddy is exactly what I was looking for: modern looking without silly baby patters and very functional. The size is perfect for storing lots of diapers, wipe dispenser (I have Oxxo), diaper cream, hand sanitizer, and a stash of nursing pads. The waterproof changing mat is a great addition and is very easy to clean. Another great thing is that the caddy is made of PVC, BPA and phthalate free material which is extremely important for me. My only complaint is the limited choice of colors, I wish it comes in pink, purple, or some other fun colors.",1
"I was looking for a crinkle toy for my baby, and was disappointed that the crinkle material is only inserted in the head of this bear Given the very small size of the toy, it is pointless for little children - they have to possess quite good fine motor skills to make crinkle sounds",0
"Ordered these for my daughter so that she could have extras as she recently gave birth to twins. She reports they work and fit just fine. Price was was right. She is grateful to have all of the extra components. One set isn't enough so, if you are going to pump, by all means order a 2nd set of everything.",1
This is a great product especiall for the price.  We are using this product in the nursery at our church.,1
"I bought 2 of these for my twin sons when they were 5 months old. I needed something to help me because they both only wanted to hang onto my arms and &#34;walk&#34;, so I thought this would be a good start. The reason I chose this walker over another is that it is height adjustable which is mandatory - don't fall for the cheaper models that don't adjust for height! These walkers have grown with my boys and they love them! The lights, sounds, and buttons are all fun for them to play with, but really they just walk/run around like crazy in them. I would spend the money all over again in a heartbeat. My boys are almost 7 1/2 months now, and they still fit perfectly in them!",1
"At first when I found these wipes I was so excited that they were 100% compostable and made from renewable sources. Prior to having our baby, my husband and I had always made it a priority to buy products that support the environment or at least have as low an impact as possible and so intended to do the same after the birth of our son.  This being said, we opted to try Broody Chick wipes and put 4 packs on our registry.  After going through two of the packs, we have found that the wipes dry out almost immediately. Also, the material is somewhat rough and instead of coming out of the package one wipe at a time, a whole pack of about 10 wipes comes out. All in all they are pretty annoying and my hope is that the manufacturers will try to change a few things, because the concept of the wipes is really what a lot of people looking for, but they are not quite able to deliver.So far, the best option for us has been reusable washcloths by Kushies that we just use warm water with.But if you don't like washing poopy cloths then try Nature babycare Eco-Sensitive Fragrance-Free Wipes.",0
"This is the second time I've bought this bib, the first was for my now 2 1/2 year old and this newest one is for my 10 month old baby who's just starting to get into finger foods.  The first bib has held up great for being used three times a day for well over a year now, I rinse it after every use in the sink and hang to dry (air-dries fast in between meals) and wash it in the washing machine about once a month with towels and a little bleach.  The material has definitely thinned but it still works great keeping my messy toddler's clothes clean and catching all her food scraps in its little pocket.  Now that my son is really starting to get into finger foods I knew I had to order one of these for him too. Buyer please be aware that when you order this you will get whatever color they send you, I thought I was getting a green one and got blue instead, which is fine for my son, I'm just glad I didn't get a pink one.  If you're picky about the color I would suggest finding a Amazon seller that lets you select your color choice.  One other thing is that the neck is a little big on these, I put a small thicker cotton bib underneath (like one meant for drooling babies) to protect the top of their shirts from food. Overall, these bibs are great and I would recommend to all parents of babies and toddlers!",1
I use these to keep my dogs in certain parts of the apartment. I have two terriers and a chihuahua and it works great for them! My only issue was that it took me a few minutes to figure out how to adjust the length.,1
Love the cap on the top of the bag. It really reduces mess. I think this is a great system for breastfeeding mommas!,1
"I can swaddle my baby in a receiving blanket much better and tighter than with this particular swaddler.  It's just not snug enough.  My daughter at just a few weeks old could pop an arm out within minutes.  I registered for (and received) 2 of these and i have not used them more than the first attempt.  I received another swaddler however, from the hospital gift shop that is made from a thin cotton material (like a t-shirt) with a really long wrapping end and it is wonderful!!!!  My daughter (who is now 3 months old) actually smiles when I start to wrap her into it.  It is so efficient that I can wrap her at bedtime and she's still snugged into it 7 hours later when she wakes up and she's still smiling. I regretfully do not know the brand of this snuggler but please shop around for it b/f buying this one.",0
"I order this bassinet and it arrived before time, which I was very pleased. I set it up last night and it look's amazing. Love the blue color; really stands out. It was somewhat easy to build.  I have no complaints about this product; simply love it.",1
"After a disastrous one-month attempt at nursing my newborn son, I realized that if I wanted to avoid giving him formula, I would have to exclusively pump. My sister-in-law bought me a Lansinoh Affinity pump at my shower. It worked well for the first two months I owned it, but after those two months, I quickly wore out the motor from pumping day after day. I needed an AFFORDABLE hospital grade pump that didn't require me turning up the volume on the TV to hear over it.I did a lot of research, and after reading glowing reviews, I settled on the Spectra, which was not only hospital grade, but it was quiet and cheaper than the other name brands. I was a bit hesitant at first because it is not portable (cannot run on batteries) and it was not prevelant in the American market, but I needed an immediate decision, so I went for it based on the strength of the other reviewers.I regret NOTHING.This is an incredible pump. I had terrific milk expression after one use, and it is just as quiet as advertised. Even on the ""12"" setting, I don't have to turn up my TV. The nightlight is probably the best feature ever. I used it all the time on vacation without waking the hubby or baby, and it helped me in and out of the room without turning on the overhead light.The flanges are a bit small for my DD breasts, but I didn't want to fork over the mucho dollars for the next size up, and they still work fine. I seriously wouldn't ever want any other pump. Worth every single penny. I &lt;3 Spectra!",1
"This is the best idea ever, my son is 4 months old and he loves his pacifier but still so small and has a hard time keeping it in his mouth, but with this nifty thing he keeps it in his mouth. When I would be riding in the front seat I would have to reach my arm into the back seat and hold the pacifier in his mouth almost the whole ride by the time we reached our destination I couldn't feel my arm. Now I just lay one of these on his chest and even if he falls asleep it doesn't fall out of his mouth so if he starts trying to suck again it's still right there for him.",1
We keep these fastened to her car seat handle and she loves to look at them when we are driving or walking. I highly recommend them.,1
"Good value. Great for toddler lunch boxes and on the go, as has a locking position to prevent spills, But toddler will need to ask for help to move to unlock position - that can be either a plus or a minus depending on your needs, but its a plus for me.",1
"My great neice loves it so much., she laughs and jumps and has a blast. Her mom also enjoys watching her play.",1
"This is my first pregnancy, and I was having trouble keeping myself from rolling over on my back when I slept, and it was difficult to get comfortable on my side. The Snoogle has helped me so much, I sleep better, and more comfortable, and it isn't so big that my husband is on the couch. I love it!",1
"The BabyKicks is a great OS 4 snap rise diaper. I love that it is a side snapping diaper because then my daughter is less likely to undo the snaps and it gives the front a cleaner appearance. The leg gussets are a little different than what I am usto since they are fleece but they are so much softer on my baby's legs. I love the Hemp inserts too, I can either stuff the diaper or lay them on top!",1
This was a life saver during church for my daughter. She would sit and play and chew with this on my neck.  It's reasonably stylish too!  I actually had a man ask me if it was real Jade!,1
"This is the most handy bathtub for little ones. My daughter started using this as soon as she grew too big for the sink. She is now 13 months old and still loves it. It's great..you don't have to clean your big bathtub each time she needs a bath..just set the duck in. Also, handy for vacations..just deflate and pack it and then you don't have to use nasty hotel bathtubs. This product is more convenient than those hard plastic portable tubs. Stores easily, easy to clean, doesn't use a ton of water, and affordable. We bought ours at target for $9.",1
"I travel a lot--for work and for pleasure--and I take my son everywhere with me. This has been AMAZING and completely re-energized me about traveling. I used to travel just with just a stroller, which was okay when he was a lap child on planes but then not okay when I had to rent car seats; they were always gross and looked sketchy and unsafe. Then, I bought a travel bag for my humongous Britax car seat and I would check it. But, that meant I had to lug that big, heavy thing around the airport while pushing my son in a stroller and somehow managing to pull our luggage too! It's more manageable at the terminal where there are those metal cart things to rent or once our bags were checked, but I have had to hike through long-term parking and catch the shuttle like that!! Oh, and then, once at my destination, I had to get all that crap (and it becomes crap after a day lugging it all around) from the baggage claim to the rental agency.Then, my son got older and needed his own seat on the plane and he would not sit still through the boring, drawn out take off time when he had no entertainment, and the flight attendants were always rude and wouldn't let me just hold him because &#34;ma'am, everyone needs to be sitting in their own seats with their seat belts fastened.&#34; But, seriously, airplane seat belts are no match for a toddler. That's also when I started becoming more concerned about his safety on airplanes and decided I needed to start carrying his car seat on board with us, but I really couldn't keep carrying all this stuff with me around the airport with me.  A couple of times I opted for the car seat over the stroller; I was even more miserable chasing after my toddler running around the airport while carrying all our crap or having to drag him along when he was crying and really wanting me to carry him and I simply could not carry one more thing. It became impossible for me; I want to cry just remembering it. Then I came upon this...I have used it twice so far, on our recent trips to Hawaii and then to Texas. I no longer have to choose between the car seat and the stroller. FYI: I did buy a new slimmer car seat (Diono Radian) to accommodate the airplane and I'm glad I did. The straps are a cinch once you get the hang of them and I LOVE  the way this thing moves--push it like a stroller, pull it like luggage, easy turns and spins in a tight circle. The only sucky thing is that you do have to take the whole shebang apart to go through security, but I do it at the last possible moment and it's probably still faster than what I went through before. Oh, and it seems to get stuck or something after it's been folded up completely. But, those are minor inconveniences compared to what I used to go through. If you travel a lot with your kid like I do, and especially if you travel alone with your kid like I do, you NEED this!",1
"I love thi kick and crawl gym since my son has the collection of Ocean Wonders from Fisher Price, it's amazing!",1
The price was so great!  I always use NUK brand for nursing pads.  They are very reasonable priced and fit pretty good.,1
"I thought this car would be more like one of those pooping toys that you push but this pops so softly that it doesn't grab my son's attention at all. It's also pretty hard to pull back and make go, it definitely doesn't drive on carpet. I wish this was a little better quality because it could have been a great toy.",0
I actually use this to keep the door open to the room where we keep the cat's litter box. Its a subtle product and keep guests from closing the door.,1
"These spoons are great. They are baby safe, they change color with heat, they are safe, and they grip the food nicely. The spoon is small, but the bowl of the spoon is deeper than other baby spoons, so it holds the food nicely.",1
"This is a great bouncer, but a bit pricey.  It keeps my baby from slouching like other bouncers and keeps her cool.  The only thing I'd like to add is for BabyBjorn to add toys to this bouncer to keep babies entertained.  My daughter will get bored and will not sit for long in this babysitter.TO BABYBJORN:  PLEASE ADD TOYS",1
"Started using this spoon 2 weeks ago. Really good material and easy to wash/carry around, just need to make sure that you pur&eacute;e very fine before filling, else the baby food gets blocked.",1
"Great rug! Is not cheap like other rugs. Cleaning might be a challenge, but it is well worth the buy.",1
"This wearable blanket is fantastic--it is lightweight, easy to take on and off for diaper changes, and fits nicely. My son doesn't wake up sweaty like he did in the Halo versions. I particularly love that the front is fuzzy but the back is breathable--more like a blanket than a wrap. We have both the blue and the green in the small, and I just ordered the front zipper version in the green in the medium now that he is growing out of the smalls. My only complaint, and it only happened with the blue one, is that the velcro curled a little on the L shoulder attachment. I don't intrinsically care, but my son was waking up with scratches on his L cheek because the the velcro was finely poking through the ribbing on the outside of the tab. I put some moleskin on it to fix the problem. I am also going to be notifying Breathable Baby of it so they can look into it.",1
No magic here. Starts to stink after one poopy diaper. Works better to use little bags and throw the diapers away outside immediately.,0
"We have not used this yet since we live in Florida and as of 431AM on Black Friday, it's still 70+ degrees.Since Amazon reminded me to review this product, I can only comment on my neighbor's glowing recommendation which led to our purchase.Apparently, this is the best snot sucker on the market.  My initial question was ""if this is so great, why doesn't Babies r us carry this?""  My neighbor had no answer to my awesome logic.  Moving on...So my neighbor's son Jack-Jack has been getting sick recently and they use NoseFrida to suck the snot out to keep Jack's sinuses clear.  The filter keeps the sucker from ingesting any ""nasties"" from said baby.  It is also described as easy to use.  I asked if we could borrow theirs and I haven't seen then since...My neighbor said she is addicted to using the NoseFrida.  Alas, the answer I have been looking for.  Babies r us doesn't carry this product because it made out of crackrock.",1
Great bag!  It fits all my needs and holds the items that are needed for the baby. The pouches are great!,1
"Product came on on-time (early) and was a breeze to assemble - 4 screws and fasten on the covers!  The seat cushion is supportive but soft and the back support is very comfortable.  My wife is 5'10&#34; and can rest her head on the top of it easily.  I am 6'3&#34; and have to slouch just a touch to rest my head on the top.  For me, the extra 300-400 was not worth it to get the dutailier grande (extra tall) chair.  Quiet glider.  The beige microfiber looks great.  Had for 1 week now and anxiously awaiting the baby.",1
"Very cute, just didn't fit my the crib. This can only fit a wide railed crib.",0
My daughter loves these forks and they are the perfect size for us to feed her or her to feed herself.,1
"I hesitated before purchasing this, because of the size (it really is huge!), weight (it's really heavy!), and price (it's expensive!). However, I decided to go ahead and try it, because my little ones are forever wanting to come up and help with cooking, washing dishes, or just watch what I'm doing.It is very sturdy - and I do mean VERY sturdy! One reason for the weight and size, I supposed...It easily holds two of my kids at the same time, and they can actually all four fit in and still are able to turn around and move, so it really is very big. This is an advantage if you are wanting to put more than one child in it, or want them to be able to play in it (with the little lemonade stand cover that you can purchase for it), but it is a strong disadvantage if you have a small (especially narrow width) kitchen. We have a pretty narrow kitchen, and it takes up half the width, and due to the weight, is a real pain to have to move out of the way to put dishes away, open the oven, etc, but we love it anyway. It is very difficult to move and maneuver, due to the weight and shape of the item, but we have used it every day, literally, since we got it in. The first one arrived with a defective piece, and we called Little Partners directly. Their customer service was superb, and they even included the little lemonade stand part for free, as an apology for the hassle. I highly recommend both their product and their customer service! It is so great to be able to put my kids up in this to help in the kitchen, knowing that they are safely out of harm's way from the stove but are still near enough to be able to actively help. The part they stand on is height adjustable, so I can put it at a height that places them at the perfect level by the counter to be able to see well. They love it and so do I. It is built very sturdily, and allows my kids to be active participants in the kitchen. The only other gripe I have about it is that the design of the part where they stand could be better. Because of all of the cracks and crevices, food gets stuck in the cracks very easily, and is not easy to clean out. If there would be a way for them to change the design so that there would not be so many cracks for food, it would be better...overall, we are very happy with it, and feel that even though it's on the pricey side, it's worth the cost in the long run, as it has completely solved our issues with our kids wanting to be up by us, but not wanting them standing on an unstable stool, or a chair with no guard to keep them from falling off...it provides a safe place for my to put my youngest two kids while I'm working in the kitchen, so they're not running around the house, unsupervised, while I'm busy. This alone makes it worth the price.",1
"This is a great pump for travel or here and there pumping.  Manual pumping just cannot compare to electric pumping for full-time use.  I have the pump in style advanced (which I LOVE - worth every penny).  I got this one for travel and it works well, but I don't see how manual pumping can ever beat automatic pumping.  It works well enough, but takes some getting used to.  The other thing to be weary of is only silicone nipples are available with the Avent system.  My son quit silicone nipples after 3 months and the avent system does not have latex.  I've since found out that this is fairly common, so if you go with the Avent system, you may end up having to change and this pump does not fit standard size bottles.  If you have to choose between this and the Medela, go with Medela!  (Make sure to get a new one as I've heard the older ones do not work nearly as well.)",0
"We loved this monitor when we first got it. We were sold by the ""trusted"" Graco name and also the digital concept, as we have a small NYC apartment and had heard a lot about interference. But it completely died right around the time our daughter turned 4 months old. At first we thought it was the battery, but it just gave out.Another thing that always annoyed us about it was that the plug for the listening unit (the one in the baby's room) popped out really easily. We'd often be fumbling around, usually in the dark since the baby was sleeping, trying to get the plug back in.Hopefully if and when we have kid #2 another company will have made a great digital monitor...",0
"Pros:+good material+washer safe, colors do not fade+nursing cover wraps around and covers the baby fully+folds easily into a smaller size (can even fit your back pocket if done right)+inexpensiveCons:-some people might not like that you will have to maneuver the baby to make sure nothing shows (Vs. having a full blown tent under your head...)Overall, great cover for the price!",1
"I needed a second base for our Britax baby carrier.  Kind of expensive, but what you gonna do?  Works good.",1
nice and very well formed...my covers fit perfect and really like the safety belt...my son and daughter in law was very pleased,1
"I got this as a gift and I wish I had a gift receipt to return it...I takes up too much space in the freezer and only holds 12 bags.  Before I got this organizer,  I used a tall rectangular snapware container with a lid; it held more bags and took less space in my freezer. I'm definitely going back to my good old container, I hope to find another use for this.",0
This is the biggest piece of crap furniture I have ever purchased. Don't waste your money. Spend a little extra and get something that will last. The drawers don't fit right and change positions every time you open them. I hate this dresser!!,0
"We have two cameras and one monitor. We use it to watch two different rooms on opposite sides of the house. It works great for us! And they have great customer service.We have a larger house and the range works for us, although we cannot go far outside with it. The night vision is good enough for us to tell if our kids are awake or asleep. You can see if they are breathing, but you have to look closely at the monitor. It works best if the monitor is close to the bed. In one room, we have it on the opposite side of the room from the bed. We can still see our child, but not a lot of detail in the dark.  Also, the tilt on the monitor and auto mute are great.",1
"I'll preface this with the admonishment that I do not have an infant to try it on.  With that caveat, I am an experienced parent and grandparent.  We made extensive use of the back pack type of baby carrier 37 years ago.  I have used carriers since when baby sitting grandkids.  This carrier seems very high quality.  The materials are top notch.  I particularly like the versatility of the product.  It has the front forward position that I have found is favored by infants after the first month or so of development.  The versatility and the quality of construction insure I will be using this with the next grandkid due in several months.  Keep in mind, it is expensive.",1
"I have NEVER reviewed a product before in my entire life, but I feel so passionately about this product that I could not not review it.  My son was born six weeks premature and we were having a HORRIBLE time getting him to sleep once we came home from the NICU.  We had tried swaddling before but he seemed to HATE it so we had given up.  Finally after one particularly long night I mentioned this blanket that my friends had recommended to my husband.  He said at this point we would try anything so I ordered the Miracle Blanket right away.  This blanket has CHANGED OUR LIVES!  My son went from sleeping in 45 minute to hour and a half stretches to now sleeping for one five hour stretch, getting up feeding, sleeping for a four and a half hour stretch, feeding and then going back to bed for another hour and a half or so.  This all happened in the span of 3 weeks!  I truly was skeptical because we had tried everything, but I promise this actually works.  We used to have to do the crib dance where we would get him to sleep in our arms, lay him down in his crib, and have him wake up almost immediately screaming.  Now we lay him in his bed and he STAYS ASLEEP.  for all those sleep deprived moms out there....you know that this is the true miracle.On a side note, he is also colicky so whenever he gets in one of his fits and can not calm himself down I wrap him in the blanket and rock him and he is able to get a hold of himself.  I can not say enough good things about this blanket.  It has truly allowed me to keep my sanity through this all!",1
This pump is great!! In less than 30 minutes I can fill up 5 ounces. Now I will soon try the double electric machine cuz the single works great,1
This is just what I was looking for and expecting.It's soft enough and provides the head support my baby needs.,1
"Fit in nicely, didn't even have to read instructions.  Infant seat snaps in well.  Waiting to use more extensively, baby is due any day.",1
"This is the first product review I have written, but I really felt I needed to let people know about this product.  DO NOT buy this product unless you intend to modify it and screw it in the wall.  My attempts at installing it normally failed when it fell off with the slightest nudge.  I really needed it to work, so I drilled a hole in it and installed it to the wall with a screw.  With that modification, the product works well and is very sturdy.",0
"Reading the glowing reviews, I wonder how long people have been using these.  First let me say this is the only bottle we've ever tried, and our baby drinks all the time-- no problems.  At first, the bottles work great, but after some time, they begin to fall apart.  This is particularly evident if you are boiling the bottles, or dishwashing on high heat (our baby had thrush, so we had to do this).  The double nipple system begins to fall apart, dissolve, large holes start appearing in the inner (blue) nipple.  The two nipples and plastic bottle also begin to deform.  All this leads to incessant leaking.  The bottles seem to last about a month in heavy use.  Designed obsolescence?  Sure seems like it.",0
My 3 year old loves his flash costume.  He was the only Flash we saw this year.  The muscles go a little high and hit his chin and the sleeves are a little snug but that doesn't seem to bother him just makes it hard to take off.  This would be a great costume or dress up item for any Flash fan,1
My 2 year old keeps using it just because he wants to do whatever his little sister is doing.Still working after 7 months.,1
"My son loves it and my wife thinks taggie's is the best brand out there, very soft after many washes still. great gift idea",1
"excelente producto, mi hijo le ha dado much&iacute;simos golpes y a&uacute;n sigue igualito, estoy muy conforme con el, LO RECOMIENDO CON LOS OJOS CERRADOS",1
There are a lot of options on this. We play the sounds to drown out noise for our 8 month old. Our 2.5 year old loves listening to the songs on it.,1
bag is great. material is strong and the bag is spacious. the entire set is perfect. the set is true to size,1
"I just switched to cloth diapers so I bought a whole bunch of different inserts. I tested them on my baby as well as comparing the absorbancy with microfiber terry cloths, muslin, and plain old folded up dish rags.These compare equally to 3-layerd microfiber terry cloths which cost only about 2 dollars per piece on eeeba.y. Be careful that you don't buy the real cheap stuff from china  that is only two ply- it frays.These work out to 5 dollars a piece and they are not that special. I gave this product a 4 stars because it easily absorbs 1/2 cup of fluid, just like the 3 ply microfiber terry cloths. Muslin doesn't hold as much , and neither does flannel dish rags .",1
"This is great for travelling or very occasional pumping, but I figured it would be plenty for my one bottle a day. No way, upgrade to the Swing electric, it'll be SO worth it!",0
"Love this product!I would highly recommend to anyone. I bought it to make ice cubes and it really prevents smelling and I don't have to worry about placing the ice cube tray so evenly because of the nice lid! Does not spill at all!(Of course, you would not place the ice cube tray like vertically even tough it has a lid...) Thank you. Price of $4.69? I think it is very worth it.",1
"This has been my saving grace while exclusively nursing my son. Makes everything immeasurably easier, is comfy, not bulky, and easy to wash. The pocket is a nice touch as well :)So worth it! I can't recommend it enough!!",1
"This is hands down the best pump I have used. Both my sons were tongue-tied at birth, so there were latch issues which resulted in my having to express breast milk until they could learn to latch correctly. I wasn't able to resolve the issue with my first son, so we used the Symphony pump for 11 months. Somewhere in that time, I purchased the Medela Pump In Style in order to avoid the continuing cost of pump rental. After using the Symphony, I hated the other pump. I also had the Medela Swing (which I had purchased prior to my first son's birth). Again, nothing compares to the Symphony. The Swing is similar, but only a single pump and not as strong. The Symphony is the closest thing to a nursing child that you can find in a pump.The Symphony has helped me through many blocked ducts and pumps quickly and efficiently. It is a time saver and is so much quieter than other pumps. It is expensive, but when I look back on what I have paid to rent one (not to mention the pumps I purchased that I don't use), I could have purchased the pump instead! I rented the Symphony on day 2 after my second son's birth (as soon as I learned that he was tongue-tied). I immediately looked for one to purchase knowing that I would most likely have it awhile. We are planning on having more children, so it made sense to purchase one. I Just wish I hadn't wasted my money on the other pumps. This certainly falls under ""you get what you pay for"".",1
"Great little bowls.  My only complaint is that, while the bowls DO hold 7 oz. and 12 oz., they only do so if you fill the bowl up to the brim.  Who would do that and either give it to a child or try to carry the almost overflowing bowl to a table?  You certainly could not put on the lid with the bowl holding that much liquid.  Oxo needs to change the description of the bowl capacity to reflect practical use.",1
"This pail is a replacement for my year old stinky plastic diaper pail. Even with frequent emptyings and lots of febreeze, you could barely walk in my daughter's room because after a year, the smell had gotten into the plastic.  Enter my search for a better diaper pail.  And this is it!  The steel doesn't retain odor, and the air tight seal keeps in all the gross smells.  My daughter hasn't even figured out the lock yet.  You can also use regular trash bags as liners (bonus).  The finish on the steel makes for easy clean up with clorax wipes if it ever gets dirty.  My biggest (very minor) complaint is that the opening is small, so if you let the pail get too full, it's hard to get the bag out without ripping it on the lid hinge as you lift it out.  If you put your hand near the hinge between the bag and the pail as you lift it out, you can get around it.  Wish I had found this a year ago - not smelling the diaper pail is worth every penny!",1
"after using many different bags (nuk, lansinoh, maela, target) these have been my favorite. Never leak, Easy to close. Lay flat in freezer.",1
"Too big for my 29lb toddler.  I thought it was a combo set but it is just the outer shell, requires your cloth diaper to use.",0
"This stroller is AWESOME! Despite many negative reviews, I went with my gut and purchased this stroller and am SO GLAD that I did. A 3 wheel stroller is necessary for walking my son in my neighborhood which has uneven sidewalks and hilly terrain. I only jog around a track, I wouldn't jog with this on sidewalks as it doesn't have much shock absorption. The seat lays back, almost flat and the sun visor adjusts - its PERFECT! So easy to put together and easily folds up. It does stand on its own when folded but does take up a considerable amount of space. I drive a crossover and there is plenty of room in the back to transport it. My only real concern is aside from not being able to figure out how to get the pedometer to work, the tray is VERY difficult to lift and put back into place. Unlike my old baby trend stroller there is no button to release the tray lock it has a very cheap red tab that locks it into place.",1
"This snack keeper is very cute, but not very user friendly, for the child or the adult.  The hole is just a bit too small for my son to get his hand and the snacks out of easily, and he's only 19 months old.  He gets frustrated trying to fight the monster for his cheerios... On top of that, it is really difficult to open for cleaning or filling.  I feel like it is going to break every time, and if I don't empty it first, snacks go everywhere.  I got the simpler designed snack cups with the round lid, and they are working much better for both of us!",0
I love this sleep sack.  It assures that my baby is covered and doesn't get the blankets in his face.  The material is thin and perfect for cool nights.,1
"We bought this bouncer because of the reviews that said it worked well for newborns. We had concerns about reviews claiming it was too small and probably couldn't be used beyond the first month or two. Some reviews also said the chair was massive. We're happy to report these claims are exaggerated or flat-out false. Our daughter was born at 36/37 weeks and we believe this contributes to her insistence on being held 24/7 even to sleep at night. She's around 7.5 pounds now but very short in length and just on the small side overall. We needed something we could put our daughter down in for a short time and know she's happy & safe there while we catch a quick breather. The bouncer/vibrating chair we used for our first daughter is a little too big for our newest addition because it has an incline that we feel is a little too steep for her right now. This chair has worked out beautifully so far. She'll only sit in it for about 15 to 30 minutes but that's about all you can really expect from a baby just weeks old. These chairs are not supposed to be babysitters or places you park your child for hours -- that's unhealthy, and quite frankly, a little neglectful. This chair served the purpose we hoped it would for us and we're certain she'll be using it for months to come. The chair is plush/soft, has nice music and nature sounds and an attractive, neutral look as well. I wish the bird mobile had some lights and moved around -- that would make this perfect -- but it's not a deal breaker. Some reviewers dinged this chair for its size and the base being too large. I don't think it's any bigger than most nicer chairs (as opposed to the cheap variety). However, I remember thinking to myself that people were nuts about complaining of tripping over the base ... until I tripped over the base. The legs stick out kinda far from the chair and they're easy to overlook when walking by so just be careful. Overall, we would recommend this any new parent and we're really glad we finally found something our daughter will allow us to set her down in for a short stretch.",1
This is a nice set that goes with my grandson's bedroom theme.  The only reason I rated it lower is the price is highway robbery.,0
"My little guy never took to the nuk.Now I'm glad for it, but there were times I really wished he had :)I had one of these pods regardless, as I futilely carried around a Newborn Pacifiers by Soothie Blue 2-Pack in it.While my little guy didn't care for the pacifier, he LOVED chewing on this pod.I went with it.I recently purchased this one as a gift knowing that it will come in some kind of use. Plus, it's super cute.",1
These are perfect for getting a bottle ready when you're on the go.  I still use these all the time.  They are also easy to fill and clean.,1
tall back; easy to move/remove; 2 of these boosters + a Costco car seat fit in back seat of Nissan Murano.would recommend it and have purchased again myself,1
"Bigger than expected, and a real hit with an eight month old that wants to chew while he fidgets with the toy.",1
These diapers are so cute and I thought being a side snap these would work well for my 4 yr old to wear at night (she is potty trained but needs something for night) unfortunately after the first night of use her little thighs and back were red. She refused it the next night saying it hurts. I like fuzzibunz elastic because its thicker and doesn't fold under irritating the skin. I guess we will stick with fuzzibunz at night even though she wants something not so babyish at least they are comfortable and don't hurt her!,0
"I can't even tell you how excited I am about this new Kissaluvs diaper cover! I have always loved Kissaluvs diapers, so I was excited to try their cover and I wasn't disappointed at all. Since I'm considering changing our whole stash of covers over to these new Kissaluvs Marvels covers, I have been testing it hard since I received it. I have used it all day, every day for the last 3 days just to see if it would hold up. And it had far exceeded my expectations! We didn't have one leak and the cover is still just as dry and shiny clean as it was when I started using it 3 days ago. This is a one size cover that fits babies from 8-40 pounds. The rise can be adjusted to 3 different settings using rows of snaps in the front of the cover. The waist of the cover features snaps that allow the wings to be overlapped, making the waist fully adjustable for either skinny or chubby babies. Also, the diaper is specially designed to reduce the bulk between the legs at the largest settings, which makes walking easier. The leg gussets do a great job of containing all messes. The cover is made from a single layer of PUL and is unlined so that the interior of the cover doesn't retain moisture. Also, the bindings are made from the same PUL, meaning that the moisture from the interior of the diaper doesn't wick to the exterior. And I am serious about the cover staying dry no matter what. I have changed a few diapers that were dripping wet after a nap and there was NO moisture on the cover at all! I also love how trim and flexible this cover is. Because it's made from a single layer of PUL, if is much thinner and more flexible than the lined covers I have used. I was worried about a one size cover being bulky on my 2 month old, but this cover is trimmer than our old covers, even with the rise snapped down to the smallest size. This cover seriously is a marvel!!",1
Maybe I've installed these incorrectly but they don't keep our daughter out of our water heater closet. Every time she tries the one end just pops out of the snapped shut case. We put them high up and one end on the wall and one on the door and that does not work.,0
"Nice size, very quiet, holds quite a bit of water, fairly easy to fill.Good price and value.Would definitely recommend to a friend.Prompt shipping.Very satisfied with the purchasing experience.",1
I like this for making baby food for my 8 month old.  It makes a good consitancy for a baby that has already started with some solids.  It won't get it fine enough for a new eater.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it leaks out the bottom so you have to use it over the sink.  I bought it hoping to take it to restaurants but I can't imagine doing that if it leaks.,0
"I have to give this a mixed review.  Some things may be particular to my baby.  I get a lot of compliments on its aesthetics.  The music choices are limited and hard to hear.  Plus the music is a little too zen for my liking.  There's not a lot of stimulation - just that bug to look at although my baby does like looking at it but I have to bat it to get it to move as she is still too young to shake the seat.  While it is portable, I've found it heavy and awkward to move from room to room and no way would I travel with it.  Baby will stay in it for about 10 minutes only.  In the end I wish that I had saved some money and bought one of the more ""toy"" looking seats like my friends have.",0
"First of all, my husband and I bought these because they are bigger than her Avent cups and my daughter loves Dora. We get them home and as I am washing them to give her when she wakes up in the morning, I realize that one of them leaks! I tried taking the top on and off, I shook it, water still came out. I tried messing with the spill-proof valve, and that had nothing to do with it. The water was pouring out from underneath the screwed on top. But it was only one of them.So the next day, I give her the one that wasn't leaking and there's still a problem...she has to suck way too hard to get anything out! I even tried it and it was hard for me, and I'm 27! I told her she'd just have to try harder, and let her walk around the house with it, until she started whining. I looked at her and her lips were slightly swollen from all of the sucking! They hurt and were puffy! I'm calling the company first thing Monday morning, as this is Saturday night, and complain and demand my money back!",0
"I now buy this for baby showers.  I like it for my son.  It's so easy to clean, dry and reuse for the next meal.  My son has had this from the age of nine months to present (14months) and never fusses about wearing it.  He will reach into the bib pouch and eat any food he has dropped out of it.  It is also great for when he drinks because any liquid that dribbles down, goes into the bib.If you're wondering how many to buy, I'd say all you need is one.  Otherwise you'd have to store additional bibs.",1
This seemed like a good idea but if you keep it rolled up it is hard to unroll. It flips back up when you put it on you baby. And the bottom cup does not stay open all the way so it defeats the purpose of catching all the extra food. I never actually used it much. I preferred a thinner fabric one that would mold better to the babies chest and could be thrown in the wash.,0
"We never leave home without it. We don't attach it with all the straps that are provided, as just draping it into the seat seems to be plenty by the time you put the baby in it.The pocket up front is nice to store toys/wipes/etc. The fact that is packs up into its own little carry bag is great, as we've already got our hands full with all the other baby-related things.",1
We're practicing EC with our little guy and I've used this seat with the liners in them every time we need to get out and run errands. It's wonderful!,1
"It works good, I just wish it worked better on the stairs. It is really hard to mount it when you have one side rail that is round and on the other side is wall. We made it work but is was hard to figure it out.What I like about it is that it is high.",1
WE used this for a recent trip to Europe with our 6mo old and found it useful. Its heavy but sturdy and pretty comfortable forward facing car seat.,1
My daughter who is very colicky loves this! It's a bit hard to put on but once you do it a couple of time you get the hand of it. My husband who is 6'2 uses it just fine too!,1
"We think this bottle is a poor design.  It's too wide for a newborn baby.  Like another reviewer said, it smooshes up against the baby's nose and you have to tilt the bottle way too far to get the last few ounces of milk to the nipple.  In addition, the vent does not seem to work as the only way air gets back into the bottle is when the baby stops sucking and releases the nipple.  We like the playtex drop-ins better.",0
We bought this item to keep our young grandson and young dog to go into certain rooms while we are working or doing something and don't want to have to look behind you all the time for the little ones. This gate works great and just like it was designed to do.,1
"This product was great for our traveling lifestyle. It is easy to pack and travel with. We use it on the crib, pack and play, arm's reach cosleeper, and carseat. It keeps my twins' attention well and appears to be very soothing for them. It is used at home and then brought with us whenever traveling to grandparents' houses for the car ride and night times. I thought I would end up eventually wanting a larger mobile with more sounds and movement/lights but my kids like this one so much that we never needed anything else. The babies are now 5 mos and still enjoy this mobile. The batteries last and the movement is not too slow or too fast. We did end up taping the arm in place because it keep turning away from the babies when on a moses bassinet but this was only because the side of the bassinet was not straight (it worked find on other things).",1
"I ended up returning this, just because I decided I didn't need two. It's a great base though! Easy to install and stays in place.",1
"I bought this for a baby gift, won't be using it myself but the shipping was fast and the blanket is very soft.",1
"We ordered several of these at t time, have washed them regularly and they are holding up well.  Good sheets!",1
"perfect size for drying bottles, pumping parts, baby feeding dishes and spoons, etc. I wish I had bought this sooner, as my son is 7months now. I recommend for all parents.",1
"I love these wipes. Perfume and alcohol free, of course and thicker than a flannel wipe. Very soft terry cloth. I haven't had a problem with fraying edges after washing like others have. I purchased 2 sets and throw them in the wash with my dirty OS cloth diapers. The perfect accompaniment for cloth diapering mommas.",1
"This product is pretty lame, it tends to slip off the toilet seat.  And if your buying it for a boy BEWARE!  There is no lip in the front to catch the urine and it gets everywhere until the kid learns how to point everything down!",0
This is why you get what you pay for.We took this on a 2 hour flight and the handle ripped immediately. The zipper also started coming apart right away. We will be returning.,0
"This was the one toy our son just had to have all the time. It was excellent for teething. We buy this for every friend who has a baby, truly the best teether we could find and it's totally safe too.",1
"I am a part time care giver. This was easy to assmble, though I struggle a bit trying to make it collapse when it's not in use. It is easy to clean. The removable toys are pretty limited and the music loud and obnoxious.  If I were seeking a walker for my own child I would probably spend more for an upgraded model.",0
"Got this seat when my boy hit 40lbs... installed it in the car and put him in it to see what he thought.  His exact words were 'mom, get me outta this thing!'  He can't stand the car seat belt, so I returned this and got the Britax Frontier 85 instead.  Not a single complaint, the Frontier was worth the money.",0
"When i first got this i was in love with it its spacious and loved the extras but it tore withim the first month of light use """"/ very dissapointed...now im looking into buying a skip hop studio bag :)",0
"This swaddle blanket is definitely one of the most stylish blankets our daughter has, but that's not the only reason we love it. It's also huge, making it easier to swaddle her in it, AND it has a smal tag attached inside the blanket with swaddling instructions, making it very helpful for a first-time parent who needs a little reminder every now and then. This was an impulse addition to our registry, and boy am I glad we picked it. We've got more than 10 swaddling blankets, and this is far and away one of our most-used and favorites.",1
"I bought this for my three year old son and we've been mostly happy with it.  I've found it difficult to find any toilet training seat, or even potty for that matter, that works for little boys - most of the time, we have a lot of pee on the floor!  I thought I'd give this one a chance and we've found a way to use it with no messes - we turn the seat around so that our son is facing the back of the toilet.  Sounds strange, but it works because there's more room towards the back so the pee goes in the toilet instead of all over the floor!  I'm sure that for little girls this wouldn't be an issue.  My son can get on and off by himself, but I can see how a smaller toddler would need help.  I would recommend this seat for older toddlers and preschoolers.",1
"Cover is nice, softer than a previous cover purchased from Babies R Us. Has held up to multiple washings.  Nice pastel pink.",1
"I love this bag!  So many compartments, enough to designate some for ""mommy stuff"".  Super easy to wash, throw in wash, air dry, comes completely clean.  I love how easy it is to go from backpack to shoulder bag with no effort.  These are the most stylish diaper bags I have ever seen, and the fabric is heavy duty!  Ours is actually a hand-me-down, so it's already been through one baby, and well on it's way to lasting through many mre!",1
"this is so cute but i had to return it b/c the spoon head was too big for my 17 months old son.  i thought about keeping it for later when he gets older.  but it seemed way too big.  otherwise, the design is too cute.",0
"This product is made with cheap plastic and the lid scratches your hand everytime you reach in...who would want to have their child's hand go through the painful scratching lid for a handful of cheerios?!? It's like tourturing the child everytime he wants some snacks. Unlike the pictue, I received a very ugly green one with a picture of a cow on it. The brand was ""The Snack Trap"" and not ""Made For Mom Snack Trap."" This is a total rip off! Product was made in India. I'd give it no star if that was an option!",0
This is the second time I am buying it. The teat is flat and I can tell my son prefers this shape to others.,1
"I ordered this set based on the reviews, its fantastic price and the cute pics.  I want to have 2 or 3 sets for my sons cot and as I live in the middle east the selection is much more limited than the US or even the UK, I thought this would be great.Everything arrived on time, in a compact clear zip-up bag.  I couldn't believe all 10 pieces were inside, it was so small!  I'm happy to report everything was inside.  All items were as detailed, bright, well stitched, cute design.  There were a lot of loose threads which were easily trimmed off.  I was also disappointed with the quality of the bumper.  It is VERY thin, and I will need to purchase another to place in behind it.These issues are all very acceptable.  I knew I wasn't paying for a plush luxury item, but what I couldn't forgive was the quilt.  It was filthy!!  It had several large yellow glue like stains on it and grubby grey marks.  I don't expect any item to be sold in this state, even at this price.  It really grossed me out!!Its still in the packaging in the nursery, but I will wash it (several times), to try to remove the 'stains' before the delievery of my baby.  I don't think I would but another set from this supplier.  As cute as the detail is, I'm disappointed that they let products leave their factory in this state.",0
"Somebody gave us these pillow balls when we find out we were having a baby boy, they are big enough and nice, we put them on a shelf on the baby's room along with other sport related items, good buy!",1
"We use this monitor in our 3 story townhouse and we always get excellent reception from any floor.  I can also testify to the durability of this monitor: while on vacation, a gust of wind blew one of the receivers into a hot tub.  After fishing out the receiver it appeared to be dead and I was so mad at myself for leaving it too close to the hot tub.  However, I removed the battery and after drying out the receiver started working again and has never given us any trouble.",1
"I just love this bottle brush!  Its high quality and really cleans well.  I bought the first one with the stand, and now just buy the brushes to keep in the original stand.  Any other bottle brush I've tried feels cheap and flimsy, and is hard to access the nipple cleaner.",1
This toy will definitely keep a child's attention-lots of movement and clicking and clacking! Seems to be well made also,1
"These storage bags are fantastic!  They are the only ones that I've been able to find that are Lead-free, Latex-free, and BPA-free!  I feel confident that these storage bags are not subjecting toxins and chemicals in to my breastmilk and in to my baby.  I've been using them for 5 months and have not had one single leak.",1
"I'm the grandma and bought this for my daughter who has three children under 5.  The baby needed a safe haven to play.  Not a tiny pack n play!!!  Our generation couldn't live without the square, large playpen.  Now your generation doesn't have to!This is a super product.  Well made.  Large size.  Perfect for my grandson who is 10 months.  Plenty of room to play with toys.  Loves the toys on the sides also.Enjoy.",1
"Like other people have said, it is indeed orange and purple, but I loved that, so my little girl won't be drowning in pink.I have not washed it as yet but it provided endless possibilities for color coordination in the nursery!",1
"Love love this set! I'm about to have a baby girl sometime next month, and it just fits perfect in her nursery room, colors are bright, just what i expected, I do recommend this product !",1
"I bought this diaper pail as a replacement for my old one when it broke (after 4 years of use). I was initially thinking about just replacing the old with the same brand, but after reading the reviews for that one and this one (and several others), I decided to try this one. Here is what I have found:Pros:-Mostly does what it says as far as odor removal - when closed, it *generally* doesn't smell, when open - P.U.!-The bags are very easy to put in and remove and are easy to seal when full.Cons:-Most of the reviews I read said the bags hold about 40 diapers. They must have been newborn/size 1 because I'm lucky to fit 20-25 size 5's in it. I go through 2-3 bags per week, which can get kind of pricey, but should be expected when purchasing something that takes specialty bags in the first place.-After only 2 months of use, the tab that keeps the lid closed broke. I have continued to use it without the latch, with no problems, but kind of disappointed that it broke so quickly.-After 6-7 months, it has become increasingly difficult to close the lid (empty or full). It now does not shut without serious effort and it makes some terrible noises like the whole lid is going to snap off if I try to close it. Needless to say, after only 6-7 months of use, I have decided to replace this pail with the same product I originally used (which lasted 4 years and didn't require special bags).",0
"Looks like I received a defect. After I removed ""Sophie"" from the package, I gave it a rinse and the spots from one side came off. Then some of the black from the eyes washed out. So weird. Package said it was made in France but my guess was China. Good thing I didn't let my baby have it who knows it could have been lead paint! ? I hope the seller looks into this.",0
My son loves his jumperoo. He just figured out the other day that he could bounce and he has been going nuts. It has plenty of things to interest him and when he bores with one side I rotate the seat so he has a different perspective.,1
"My granddaughter loves this teether, it is colorful, easy for her to hold and chew on, she also loves to chew on the leaves - it is one of her favorites!",1
I like that it can serve multiple seating arrangements and is small enough to stash in a bag for traveling. We most often use it as a ring on a larger toilet.,1
"Having twins means you need a bit more room. This mat is a great size, easy to keep clean and has interesting features for the babies to play with. The only complaint is the clear carry bag with the press studs, the press studs are pretty firm and as a result have torn holes and I will have to attach velcro there now, otherwise highly recomended.",1
"As a teacher, this clock has been a huge hit.  The renaissance of Dr. Seuss for my young readers is still going strong.  Now the same young readers pay attention to the Dr. Seuss Clock, which is marvelous in this digital age. A real teaching aid.  And the grown-ups love it too.",1
These replacements are are just like the originals. It's always good to have spares. I recommending buying enough for the sippies you have plus one or two spares.,1
Everyone that sees this car seat calls it a lazy boy.It is large and bulky and I love that about it. It's lightweight so switching cars is not hard but we love this seat so much that we bought a 2nd one for my husbands truck.The straps are adjustable as well as the air bug head rest which is a huge plus. My daughter has been in it since age 9 months and will be in it for a long time to come.Great car seat and I highly recommend it.,1
"I've had some inconsistent results using these. They're effective, and for the most part easy to use. In some cases, the drawer above the cabinet hangs down a little lower and doesn't allow my finger to press down on the release with just one hand. In these cases I had to shim the back of the lock to allow a little extra room. Other than that, these are really well designed. I like that they're adjustable.",1
Functional and complete for the intended purpose. Not particuliarly exciting. Leaves very little left to shop for. Okay I guess,0
"It&#8217;s still inexpensive, still easy to clean and still my toddler&#8217;s favorite. I&#8217;ve tried others and he just keeps spitting them out. My kid has good taste!",1
"Did not fit my Teutonia T-Links system, the bar across the back between wheels was not wide enough for the attachment",0
Great for toddlers but would love something similar for larger child or an adult.Could be great for travel or camping.,1
Smells good and cleans the diapers well. The package is small which makes this pricey. They should include a scoop. I stole an extra scoop from a canister of formula.,1
"german carseats don't have the chest piece and my son kept getting his arms out of the carseat. with this on, he tried once and got his arm stuck and decided to never try again :D",1
"I use this item when I'm working with students (preschoolers), especially those who are multi disabled.  I have to assist them to push individual interments but I really like the music (sound).",1
"Some reviewers have complained the tray is not deep enough and the arms not long enough.  I agree the tray is shallow but I am not trying to feed my 1yo with a plate on this tray.  I just plop her finger food right on it or use a small suction bowl.  I suppose when I start using plates it will be time to scoot her up to the table without the tray.I also agree the arms that attach to the tray seem short, that is, there is not a lot of room between her tummy and the tray.  If you are using the back padding like I am, it is especially so.  I don't mind it though.  It is not in any way restrictive and it keeps her from messing around too much.  If you have a chunkier toddler, you might need to omit using the back padding to give your child enough room.I like it for what it is.",0
"they were larger than I expected, but very vibrant and my infant seems to like them. i would highly recommend.",1
We bought this booster for a trip to grandmother's during the summer. It works surprisingly well. My son thinks it's cool that he has an inflatable seat. No complaints whatsoever.,1
"First off, I find it extremely concerning that the success of my pumping efforts and ability to feed my infant while at work teeters uncertainly on the point of a pair of tiny, fragile, and insanely expensive plastic valves.  Like many, my Ameda pump was insurance-issued and I had no choice of pump.  With a brand new set of valves, my pump performs great.  I baby my valves, removing them with a.spoon per my Ameda customer service representative's instructions, carefully washing, and air drying them on a towel. Despite my efforts, these spendy little nuggets go downhill fast. I swear, all you need to do is look at them wrong and they instantly develop microscopic tears.  Within a week or two, my pump suction begins to suffer, as does my husband as he deals with my pump-induced frustration and mounting rage. It seems like every mom I talk to has some issue with their pump, regardless of brand.  I will say that I had great experience with the Ameda customer support staff, even receiving a replacement motor early on when mine crapped out.  Yes, it was great to get a free pump through insurance, but being locked into the constant valve replacement is not-so-great.  But, here we are!",0
"This is the best baby bath we've owned. (There have been three total.) The baby is held securely in the sling until he/she is old enough to sit in the bathtub itself. We definitely felt safe bathing our baby in this product, and it's also a cute design. Seemed very durable, as it lasted us nearly a year. No complaints!",1
"My son loved this pacifier and he had two. Lost both. I bought two more then stopped after we lost those. They are just way too expensive to keep buying unless you are wealthy and aren't budget conscious. I know buy whatever is cheapest, he doesn't seem to mind any difference.",1
"Like the deluxe slipcovers a lot better than the regular.  The quiet release clip helps a lot.  I was disappointed when ordering the Blue.  It is not the color shown, it is more or a baby blue (light pastel color).  The sunburst print on this page is also not DELUXE even thought it shows as an option under that title.",1
"We flew with our infant regularly, so I needed product(s) that would be compact and keep her entertained on the plane. Maybe it was just my daughter but she was not a fan...the zipper was fun...the clip was a little too much for her (and still is at 15 months)...it just did not seem like each little item was collectively age appropriate. My daughter could do the zipper at 8 months no problem and pull of all the little pieces...she could not do a button though or the clip...well now she is 15 months and can do the button with ease, not the clip and has no interest in the other pieces because she essentially outgrew them. The mirror is completely fuzzy and was since we purchased it, light does not even reflect from it very well. Not worth the price...there are so many better toys out there for travel!",0
"My two year recently started using the potty during the day. She does not use diapers anymore, so I take this with us when we go out. Although I was hesitant because she is used to her own potty chair and not a seat for the regular toilets, she did really well with this seat. I love that it folds and fits right in my bag for portability and convenience. She is comfy on the seat and goes with no issues.",1
"Great value, simple to install, my grandson appears to be and says that his is comfortable in it. Not great quality plastic in some places that don't really count.",1
"This product matches the glowing reviews it has received.My granddaughter has been playing with it one way or another for months. Each developmental stage she goes through, there is a different way to play with this. It is quiet, safe, colorful, useful, portable and not expensive.",1
"LOVE this brand - have the burp cloths, bibs, blankets.  We used the lightweight sleep sack when my daughter was 4 months and then the heavy weight sleep sack in the winter with no problems. BUT now that my daughter is close to 1 year old and really moving around while she sleeps she puts these sleep sacks to the test! This one ripped at the seam under the arms after about 1 week of use.  We will be going back to Halo sleep sacks!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY if your baby is really moving in the crib!",0
"I have a 3 yr old and a 6 mo old. The 6 mo old goes in the second seat. He hasn't shown any signs that he doesn't like it. He's about 17 lbs and fits comfortably.  I like that it has a flap on top that I can lift up to see him. The seat is easy to attach and detach. I like that you can fold the stroller without having to detach the seats. Now, if you don't detach the seats before folding it won't fold as flat as it would without have seats attached.I would give it this more stars if the price was cheaper. I feel it's pricy for an accessory item. Also, I don't like how I have to use two hands to detach seats and fold the stroller. I've used the Chico line before and they have one handed detaching and folding. It's really convenient when your hands are full.",0
"My leather seats were getting beat up by my toddler, front spills to footprints to the indentations from the carseat base. Now this thing takes all of the abuse, and when it gets dirty I just take it out and wash it. It really saved me the other day when she spilled and entire cup of milk! About 90% of it stayed in this cover and I was able to take it out and dump it out, and only had a minor cleanup in the car. That would have been a disaster if I didn't have this installed.",1
Got this for our baby girl. I gave this item 4 stars as the remote has a sound chip which means you should probably not submerge in water or put into a sanitizer.,1
This car seat has proved to be a head-and-shoulders improvement above the other seats we have purchased in the past for our son.  The head support is a great feature and the seat itself is far sturdier than any of the other seats we have seen in the stores.,1
"I love, love, love this product!!!  This is a toy that will last through the developmental years with a child.  The cheese sorter is soft and has a crinkle sounding bottom.  The mice make different rattle and squeeky sounds when you shake or squeeze them.My son started out just feeling the texture of the toys and then started carrying the mice around and is now trying to put the mice into the sorter.  It is great for child development!",1
This pillow is much larger than expected in person ! The pillow even came with a stuffed dog toy &#60;3 So cute :),1
"I did not actually buy this product from Amazon, but I wanted to review it here for others as I find the reviews extremely helpful.We have a convertible crib that we recently converted from crib to the toddler bed. Like a lot of kids, our son moves a lot in his sleep. Even though the bed was 6-8 in off the ground, I was worried he'd fall out of bed anyway. At first we intended to buy a regular bed rail, knowing at some point we'll get a twin bed for his room.  However, some reviews I read specifically mentioned that those rails would not fit a toddler bed or a convertible crib, and I was worried they'd be too long for the toddler bed anyway.Once it was assembled, it was very easy to install onto the bed.  A great feature is that the rail itself snaps in and out of the brackets easily, so it can be removed in seconds to change the sheets, etc. It fits the bed well and there aren't any gaps or movement of the rail for anything to get caught in.The directions, however, are lacking.  There is a diagram on the first page listing all the parts and labeling them as A, B, C, etc. The actual directions are on the next page (like a book) and say something like ""Connect Bed Rail A to Bracket B"" so I kept having to flip back and forth to determine what part I was working with and where it was going etc. There are no drawings accompanying the directions themselves and I found the directions, while somewhat detailed, were still confusing. We got it all together and then determined, while installing it on the bed, that we'd put the brackets in backwards so we had to take them out. That was kind of a pain b/c they snap together sort of like tent poles, with the holes and the buttons to press down to ""release"" and the release part was hard. We had to use a screwdriver to get it to release.I think that these directions really, really need to have pictures with each step b/c it was very difficult to know if we were putting things together correctly (which we did not, apparently!)  Once it's together, it's very easy to put on the bed itself.The other comment I have is that our crib/bed has 3 mattress levels. We had the mattress on the very lowest level and then when we converted the bed to the toddler bed and put the rail on, we actually had to raise the mattress back to the middle level. It's hard to explain here but the product has a strap that connects to the opposite side of the mattress, and then you tighten it. Then it also has this rectangular bar structure that is supposed to lay flat on the mattress, with the brackets for the rail resting on the outside/other side of the mattress.  With the mattress in the lowest position, the bar structure was laying at an angle - basically the bracket side higher than the spring part of the bed b/c the brackets were resting on the outside rail of the bed, so we raised the mattress back to the middle level so the bar would rest flat against the mattress spring base.",1
I was happy to find these diapers at local stores and online. The Mabu line is a great way to get started in cloth for cheap. These cloth inserts are very absorbent and have charcoal in them to help with that. They are also softer on skin compared to other CDs. I like the fact that they are all white and can be thrown in the dryer- makes a FTM very happy!,1
What is the maximum height/Weight a child can be before they will not fit in this seat? I read 40 lbs for weight? What about child's height....?  I'm considering buying this for my granddaugther to use when they fly in for a week visit. This seat would eliminate bringing their home car seat on/off the plane. Hassle! My granddaughter is 2 yrs old and 27 lbs. I'm wondering if I can get a couple more years of use buying this..or is it too small for 3-4 yr old girls?,0
"I don't usually review things, but I felt like I needed to review this one because after I got it for a shower gift I was really worried about all the negative reviews that I have seen about this monitor.  It has been great for us!  Good battery life, no blinking red lights, good sound, small enough to fit in your pocket, never looses reception.  My son is 5 months old and we have used it every day of his life and never had one problem (knock on wood, knock on wood). We like that the base can be put anywhere and runs off of batteries if you need it too.  (Really convenient when we lay him in the pack and play in the living room and we want to go outside for yard work).  The vibration is a good option if you're doing something that you would not be able to hear the monitor, like mowing the lawn or something. We don't use it for anything else.  We usually keep the monitors on their bases, because if you turn them up, you can hear them from a couple rooms away.  There is really no need to wear these things unless you're outside or you live in a really big house.  So, maybe that's why we haven't run into any battery issues.UPDATE: He's 13 months old...and it's still going strong! :-)",1
this product is just great. these are the best bottles i have ever use,1
"Very beautiful print, I love it.  The large storage area on the bottom is great.  Glides smoothly and is easy to push.",1
My daughter chose this set for her son.  I was very impressed with the quality of the dresser and the ease in which the drawers slid.  She also has the crib and it looks very smart in the nursery.  I would recommend this set to any expecting parents.  You will be very happy with the quality and style.,1
"These are so much better than the other brands we bought. We bought the very colorful, bent bottle, vent flow ones and they leaked, were hard to get suction going, caught so much air that the milk looked like it was cappicino froth, and our baby had so much gas then. She would get frustrated trying to eat and it took longer. Now she eats faster and has much less gas. Plus you can see there is no froth. The travel disks prevent leaking and we are much happier!",1
"The stroller clips are missing therefore the product is unusable. I am extremely frustrated, and will be returning this item.",0
"We have had this bag since my daughter was born 2 1/2 years ago; it is a very durable and dependable bag.  I picked this bag out mostly because it is a more ""masculine"" looking bag. As an active father this was important as I tend to carry the bag more than my wife.  I find it is very easy to sling over my shoulder and carry in a modified backpack/sling manner. (Strap on right should, across chest and under left arm, with the bag resting on the small of my back).  The internal pockets and bulk area hold and organize our bath products, medicines, a couple outfits, some toys, a 10 pack of diapers, wipes, and various odds and ends we pick up in our travels.  Perhaps we're efficient packers but from other reviews it seems the bag is either too big, or too small.  One word for the too small reports...""suitcase"" use it.  I completely recommend this bag to any father to be, if mine was to ever break, I'd buy it again.Only problems I have had with the bag are:1. Lost the changing pad that came with the bag (oops...my bad)2. Could use a bit longer strap.  It fits and is completely comfortable, but a couple more inches would make a world of difference.",1
Fits great in freezer space. Works wonderful for freezing baby food and breast milk storage bags. Helps make tracking the dates the item was stored.,1
This is a necessity if you are using the Guava Lotus Travel Crib.  My little guy loves the softness of this sheet and it adds a little more cushion to the mattress.,1
"I tried these on a ring that I have that's too loose. Don't have the money right now to get it sized so the the Snuggies were a temporary &#34;work-around&#34;. Not only did they pinch the skin on my finger, they fell off and I lost them over and over. Wouldn't recommend them.",0
"**UPDATE*** after installing this product correctly (which if you read my previous review was not as simple as advertised) this sprayer worked beautifully for ALMOST a year. But the trigger stopped working a couple of weeks ago, and my husband just opened it up to see if we could fix it, and the trigger is plastic inside and it is cracked and part of it has totally cracked off. I'm in the process of trying to get into contact with the manufacturer and hopefully get a replacement. I saw some other reviews describing my same situation. If you have only one child you're planning on using cloth diapers with, this sprayer may last you as long as you need it to - and you'll save a bit of money compared to other sprayers. But, if you, like me, currently have two in diapers - one who is a 9 month old baby and will be needing it for a while - not to mention I'd like to have more kids... this sprayer isn't for you. Find one of greater quality and spend those extra dollars to hopefully only have to buy one.Once it was installed, it works beautifully (so far) with no leaks or anything. The only reason I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars is because the instructions that come with the sprayer are not as straight forward was they seem. I have older plumbing, and had to go to the hardware store to get a converter part so that the sprayer would connect to the piping coming out of the wall - not a big deal, but took me forever to get around to doing that. The part where the instructions get insufficient is, I followed them: ""connect this part to this part to this part to this part.. etc"". When it came time to turn the water on - LEAKS EVERYWHERE. The kit DOES come with the parts to fix this - but if you, like me, have no plumbing knowledge and the instructions don't tell you to use these parts - you're going to have a mess on your hands. You need to use the plumbing tape to wrap around all the threads - and you also have to use the black rubber washers in some of the connecting parts in order to solve leak problems (aside from just some good ol' elbow grease and getting those things on really tight). The directions do not instruct you to do this, and it is crucial. The diaper sprayer is great though! One downside that I've noticed so far - however, is that it doesn't actually fit that great to the supplied holder. But I'm willing to put up with it to not have to ""dunk and swish"" anymore. This is one stay at home mom whose really proud of her new found plumbing skills. So excited about this appliance!",0
A good quality sheet that washed nicely and felt comfy for the baby.  The elephant pattern is precious and the colors fit beautifully in my grandaughter's nursery.,1
"Bottom line: Using regular bags saves big time $$$.  In just a few months use, the Diaper Champ pays for itself by saving money on costly refills needed for other brands.  I have never had an odor problem, but I have a 5-month-old breastfed baby, so I know her diapers now are not as stinky as they will get once we go to solids.  I also use the Glad ""Odor-Control"" bags (the price of 100 bags is probably about the same as a DG RF and will last over a year).  The Diaper Champ is also very easy to use and easy to change bags.  I highly recommend it.",1
"I really liked the quality of the item, very soft, well made. I was hoping it was a tad bigger, but otherwise we are pleased.",1
"I bought this for my son last December.  It's a great car seat, very easy to use and install.  I love that it has a 5 point harness, although my son will soon outgrow the need for it.  The seat is very comfy and he never complains about being in it.  It's much better padded and more comfortable than the Graco booster seats in my opinion.  I think this is probably the best booster seat on the market, safety wise.  The side impact protection seems excellent, and the large sides support my son's head well when he naps in the car.  I wish it  would fold up some so it's easier to transport in a trunk when not in use or if we need to take it on a plane.",1
My 11 month old niece loves it! Ever since she was born i used it and it helps with her crying. Very Soothing !!,1
Divided plates are the way to go with children and these solid coloured ones ensure that each child has their own colour. I am going to order several more packages of these.,1
"Its awesome. My kid can't open the gate and the pressure mounts are also steady.Shipping from Amazon was also great, the first time i got the gate, it had a little damage on latch but amazon return was for free and they sent across the new one within 2 days..Amazon customer service is great as well :)",1
"Shield says it will fit all standard cribs, but on my Simplicity Aspen (from Target, and very common) crib, each of the 4 shield panels failed to cover the entire side of crib.  This left an unprotected gap at each corner of the crib, which is precisely where my toddler sticks his legs and gets completely stuck.  It is absolutely useless if it doesn't cover the gaps between all the rails.  Very disappointed.  My kid will just have to learn to stop poking his legs through!  Great idea, but the product should be sized to fit all cribs as advertised.",0
This carrier very comfortable and light. Easy to latch and figure out too. It is a lifesaver and allows me to do stuff around the house. I also like that its available in black color. Highly recommended!,1
I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation and I really like how light weight it is. It is easy to snap on.,1
Love these things. Had one for my daughter and they work great. I had to buy some for my son they worked out really well for as well. recommend these strongly,1
"These are so cute! I received a red elephant and a green dog. My daughter likes the dog the best, I am guessing because of all the texture! They smell great and work well if you stick them in the freezer for a cold chew. They don't get to cold, but have a nice chill!",1
"My son loves this mobile, ever since he was about one month old he kept watching the little figures and when he turned two months he even laughed when the little animals turn individually. Right now he's five months old and still loves it.",1
"This hammock seems to hold an endless amount of stuffed animals from the teeny tiny bears to larger ones. Looks cute in the corner of the room and I like that it bends, isn't stiff so it really sits like a hammock.",1
"I LOVE this product and highly recommend it to anyone!  We just got back from our first trip to Walt Disney World with our kids, and put one on both our almost 3 year old and our almost 1 year old.  Both kids were a little fidgety when I put the stickers on and when I wrote in my phone #, but otherwise they didn't have a problem with them.  Never  fussed about them feeling uncomfortable at all.  We put them on the first day of a week long vacation and the stickers stayed on even after we arrived home, even through multiple baths.  The ink from the pen provided stayed sharp as well.I had room on my son's sticker to write our phone # and the words ""PEANUT ALLERGY"" below it.  I know that this was noticeable to people because we got a lot of comments not only on the kids' tattoos but they even mentioned ""oh he has a peanut allergy?""  Great for kids with food allergies!  Safetytat does make tattoos with allergy information printed on them, but I wanted the ""quick stick"" version because they are stick on, no water required!  The designs are cute.  Because they stayed on for the entire trip, I only had to use 1 tattoo for each kid, leaving 4 more for other trips, making this a better value than you might think initially.EXCELLENT PRODUCT!  I will tell all of my friends, especially those travelling with toddlers, about these.  LOVE THEM!",1
"I bought this for my newborn daughter. I'm not huge into stuffed animals since a lot of them shed their fuzzy fur and I noticed that some of them even irritated her face if she rubbed against them. This dog is SUPER soft and the fabric it is made from doesn't shed at all. I don't even know how to describe how soft this dog is. It was a little expensive, but for a toy that is completely organic AND is this soft and hand made? I think it is definitely worth the money especially because it has held up so well. I've washed this a few times (by hand) and the dog comes out looking like new.If you're looking for a super soft, organic, durable, well-made stuffed toy for your kid, I highly recommend! I'd rather pay more for one really high quality product (this one is even made in Europe, not China) than get a bunch of cheaper stuffed animals that I either can't wash or that aren't nearly as soft.",1
I don't even know how many start to leave for this diaper so I'm going with 3 I guess. The diaper is very cute! but it's so small my 7 month old weighs 21lbs will not fit in the diaper the rise is way to small I don't know why it says that it's going to fit all the way to toddler age I've never seen a toddler weighing under 20lbs. I don't recommend the diaper to anyone with even an average size baby. so when I go the diaper I squished my son in to it and he only peed once and the diaper leaked obviously it was the fit but I don't think the diaper can hold that much even with the right fit and I don't think you can put both inserts at the same time since that makes it look like a balloon and very uncomfortable.,0
"These are perfect for making your own baby food.  They snap on tight and don't come off in a lunch box.  I love that I can put them in the dishwasher too.  After I bought the first set, I went back and ordered two more!",1
"I love this nose sucker, it works great!  I used it for both of my kids.  It gets the jobs done.",1
"Daughter loved it big ,spacey , trendy and not bulky .  Easy to find what you need with out emptying the entire bag.",1
"Unlike child and infant car seats, booster seats are simple in design.  It is hard to see how a company can mess up the design of a booster.  This one worked quite nicely when we took it with us to Florida on the airplane so that when we rented a car, our 4-year old could ride safely.  It worked nicely and was a cinch to setup.  We now use it in my Honda CR-V on a daily basis it is fine and my (now 5-year old) is quite comfortable.",1
"This ball is an absolute gem. It's the perfect size for my nine month old to pick up in one hand. The sawn-off edges mean it rolls really straight, and the little guys popping out slow it down. This means I can sit her at one end of our apartment and roll it about twenty feet along the wooden floor in a slow, perfect straight line, and she can anticipate it and catch it. You can imagine how many smiles that generates. She also loves to watch me toss it from one hand to another. Trust me, you gotta get this ball.",1
This was a gift.  I had to return it because the recipient could not get  the new avent natural bottles and nipples to fit it the unit.,1
"I did a lot of research on cloth diapers and tried out several. At first I thought I was an AIO person until I discovered Thirsties. These prefolds combined with the Thirsties covers are SO easy to use and so thin and absorbant! If you are shopping for cloth diapers make sure you look for something with a hemp or bamboo blend, not microfiber or 100% cotton. The hemp and bamboo make them SO much more absorbant - and I know this from experience. My heavy wetter wears cloth at night. I use 2 of these at night and only have to change him if he nurses more than twice overnight (which is rare). Oh, and I will add that when he does nurse, he eats a lot - he was nearly 10 lbs when born and has maintained this size on the growth curve - he is now 7 months and these still work great. I replaced my entire stash with these!",1
My son got upset when eating. After we changed him to level 2 nipples he's back to eating like a champ. These are perfect starting at 3 months until 5 months or so. Then we had to up the levels again.,1
This toy is a joke!!! Don't buy it!!! It lasted for 5 minutes then quit... Very disappointing... I thought it would be fun to play with in the bathtub... But what do you tell your granddaughter when it quits working????,0
"Save your money, this is a piece of junk.Specifically:1. Suction is terrible. Even on the highest setting, it only got out a little foremilk, no hindmilk. I had to use a hand pump to finish even after 15 minutes of pumping.2. Loud as hell. It woke up my sleeping baby.3. Vibrates terribly. It's like one of the vibrating beds at a cheap motel. Extremely annoying.I threw it in the trash after one use. I can't even return it because it has been used. :-(",0
"The suction cups do not work in our tub!  It is more of a hazard than help.  If my daughter barely bumps into the liner, all the suction cups come undone and it folds in ontop of her!!!!",0
"Significantly lighter than other twin strollers.  Pretty easy to put together, easy to use.  Our Chico carseats snapped right in.  Appears very stable.  Big basket underneath.",1
"The ONLY reason I gave this seat a 4 and not a 5 is because I do not understand the SICT purpose. I can push it in with my hand very easily. How it makes the seat safer, is a mystery to me. I am not sure it was worth the extra $50.00 for this feature. Aside from this, I love the seat and my daughter seems to like it as well. She is a tall two year old and I feel she fits in here better than she did the Britax Boulevard (She was still within the height and weight range for that seat).",1
very cute but nothing on the back to secure it to floor however that does make it easy to wash that is the only reason I did not give it a 5 star size is great for next to bed  but she has sliped on it a few times I told my daughter to get a mat for under it otherwise a great purchase for her new bedroom that is all hello kitty,1
my daughter has lost her bunny two times and i just love it so much i had to make sure she had one more :) so i bought another one! love it,1
loving these. they are what they appear to be!great dealyou would get themmuch cheaper then the name brand,1
Always liked this product. Soft and large.  So many uses with fun prints. Great for the hot climate I live in.,1
"The quality of the product is poor, my toddler boy kicked the cover few times and it's tear on the side.I love the Inglesina trip stroller and the rain cover that came with it.",0
"This drying rack comes in handy when you are washing so many bottles. I don't think that the spin feature is necessary, but it works.",0
"The Tummy Tub is a unique baby bath. It looks a little like a bucket but its deeper and taller. What makes it better is that you can set it on the floor, on the table, or just about anywhere. There's no bending so it isn't hard on your back. Your baby is held in an upright position, even if they can't sit up yet.  Plus it will remind your little one of their time in the womb. It is really one of the coolest baby tubs I have come across to date. I wish it had when Willow was a newborn, but even now at seven months, she enjoyed her bath more than she ever had before.  To make the Tummy Tub even more convenient, add the stool and make it the perfect height to clean the baby while seated in a chair.",1
"I grew-up with these chairs! we had them as kids back in 1985 when they were still known as TYKE-HIKE my mother still has them, I just bought 3 of my own.",1
"My son loves to chew on this. The  play  setting drumbeats are incredibly upbeat and fun! I do find the sleep (mother's heartbeat) to be a bit on the creepy raspy  breathing side, but my son likes it and falls asleep to it easily. It also looks incredibly life like and has a sweet little face, it sits up so tall that it encourage my baby to lift his head to stare at it in the mornings,which is just adorable to see. The box had a wonderful presentation that it came in if you are into astehtics and something I wasn't expecting it came with a small booklet and adoption paper that I could read to my son. I am considering their night light turtle  toy because of the quality of this.",1
"Since buying this pad, I have replaced it with the one that came with my diaper bag.  It's just so much bigger and not easy for my son to roll off of.  I especially like how it can hold a good amount of diapers - four or five - and my wipes case (which didn't come with this pad).  Would've given five stars if it did come with a case.  Other than that a good product to have.",1
This is a great sippy cup - it is not spill proof but is a good training cup.  Liquids don't flow too fast - which is good - we have a cup the is for the next stage that let's more flow... this is a great product if you have read the reviews and you know what you are looking for,1
"Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to put it together. Best high chair for baby. Sturdy and stable. love it!  As he grows out of it I can continue to use the booster seat.",1
"I bought three of these sheets to fit with Natural Mat Coco Mat crib mattress (the mattress is GREAT), thinking they would fit well since they're the same brand.  They don't.  Each sheet barely fits over the top edges of the mattress and doesn't come close to the bottom edges.  Only one corner can be completely covered, and the other three nearly pop off each time my three-month-old sleeps in the crib.  This is frustrating and seems unsafe.  Note: I have washed and dried the sheets about four times.  Rating: minus four stars for a crib sheet that doesn't fit a standard crib mattress.",0
"I bought this so that I can take my 6 month old on hikes with me, and it says that it was meant for front or rear facing positions.  In rear position, it is very unsafe for baby, and there is no safe way to put it on or take it off either.  My baby fell out of the carrier while attempting to take it off, an I have not used it since, it's garbage.  Luckily she was not hurt.",0
This waterproof diaper pants is excellent. Its really good for potty training. It holds the urine until you remove it from the child. Its worth every penny. I would recommend it to all parents who are potty training their toddlers.,1
"I purchased this carseat as a seat for our second vehicle thinking it would be a great buy.  I had good safety ratings and was at a great price.  I would not put a baby doll in this seat in fear that it would not make it safely.  the directions are HORRIBLE, we were missing the shoulder pads, and the seat was put together incorrectly in the box.  After searching the internet for hours we found a video of what it should look like and how to install.  We drive a large car (4runner) and to install the seat in the full reclined position that is recommended we had to place 3 THREEE blankets rolled up under the front of the seat (as instructed in the instructions).  There were three of us with master's degrees (all mothers of multiple children) who tried to correctly put this seat in and could not after 45 min.  When we finally got the car seat latched at the correct level it was still not secured and rocked.  the most disturbing part is that when the bottom is latched in like it is supposed to be (per directions and instruction video) the back of the seat was extremely loose and would detach from the actually car seat if there was an acceleration or God forbid impact.  We are returning this carseat for the evenflo symphony DLX e3! yes, the price difference is worth the safety of my baby! PLEASE Do NOT waste your time!!! if i could give this seat negative stars i would",0
We purchased this product and were happy (initially) with how it worked.  But in under 6 months it completely quit charging. We got a new one and it happened again.  Worked for less than 6 months. The manufacturer told me that they only stand behind their product for 90 days.  They KNOW that their product does not last long and they don't really care...they already got our money.  I am VERY dissatisfied.  I would never spend $20 some dollars for a night light that is only good for 3-6 months.  That is RIDICULOUS.  Buyer beware.  This company is not interested in a product that stands the test of time or satisfying their customers.  They are only interested in getting your money and running.,0
"We got this toy when our baby was 3.5 months old--ALL the little ones in our Brooklyn neighborhood have this thing, so I figured there was good reason for it.  Indeed.  It's dimensions make it easy to grasp--my baby's little fingers fit nicely around the head, neck, or any of the legs. The long neck of the giraffe make it so that when she's holding it at her waist with her hands, it reaches all the way up to her mouth.  She loves chewing on all the knobs around the head and on the hooves.  She is attracted to the simple face with it's dark eye dots and loves to make it squeak.  This is a fantastic toy, no wonder it's been around for so many decades!",1
"These bags are great!!! easy to clean and reuse, stylish, no need to waste the disposable plastic bags anymore.  all around great product.  I am going to give them as gifts....",1
"My 22-month old son is cutting his molars and had bitten through 4 conventional teethers before I bought two of these for him. I can't say enough about them: Strong, easy to hold, and safe to chew on. Smaller than I expected, but a good size for a baby or toddler. Best ones out there!",1
The first and most important thing about these pads is that they won't stay put for a long time. My son is a power crawler and they slip right off. You'd have to make them so tight that it would stop the blood flow in order to keep it in place. It drove me crazy adjusting them all the time. The other thing is the bulkiness. It really bothered my son and as much as he could he'd try to pull them off. I guess not very comfortable from his point of view. The material could be a bit more durable too. I'm afraid we didn't have much luck with these.,0
"I really love these nursing pads.  They are EXTREMELY soft and are slightly larger in diameter than the disposable pads I had been using.  I don't have much trouble with leakage but I pretty much wear pads every day for those unexpected moments when I do leak a lot.  These have done well for me. I really like the fact that the backing is the same material the company uses for their cloth diapers - that was the selling point when I ordered these the first time (I'm about to order a second set because 3 pairs just aren't enough and I get disappointed every time they are all dirty and I have to use disposables!)There are only two downsides I can point out. Sometimes they move out of place when I wear them overnight - I've had a couple of mornings where I woke up wet.  However, I attribute that more to the fact that they are not sticky disposables, I have very large breasts, and I sleep on my stomach.  The second downside is that they do show through clothing a little - especially if they get bunched up a little somewhere around the edge.  But I have yet to find a nursing pad that doesn't do this, so I can't really take a star away from them for that either.Like a previous poster, I was also a little baffled by the turquoise tags, but I always have a bra and rarely wear light colored clothing so this hasn't been a problem for me.*Update*  I just realized that these are the black ones and I meant to post for the white ones, which unfortunately I cannot seem to find now!",1
"This was perfect, great quality and so pretty, no need to spend money on more expensive outfits, this was beautiful.",1
Product was delievered in perfect condition with all pieces.  The only issue we had was the door on the tower didn't seem to align well at first but now it opens and closes easily after using it several times. It looks beautiful. Great price! I would recommend to a friend.,1
"We had one of these when our daughter was young, she's now 10.  Now that I'm babysitting two little ones (12 and 9 mo) I wanted one for their strollers so that when we go for walks in the Oklahoma summers they are protected.  Thanks to Amazon for carrying this product, was so afraid I wouldn't be able to find it anymore after so many years!  Would and do suggest to friends as yet another way to protect our little ones from the sun's rays.",1
"The music goes off all the time...often waking us up in the middle of the night. Sometimes it's just 1 royal tune and sometimes it goes on playing tune after tune for who knows how long. And like another reviewer said...you can't turn it off, you just have to take the thing apart. This also makes it really ineffective as a reward for the child b/c it will play music for my daughter without her doing anything in it. So, she's getting rewarded for sitting there and not forming the reward association with doing something in the potty. She's also fearful of the big toilet, so taking the removable seat off and using the base as a step stool right now is not an option.",0
This thing literally takes all the fear out of trimming a newborn's nails! Even the nurses in the hospital couldn't get over what a great product it is. This will be included in every baby shower gift I ever give!It works just like it says. My baby never fussed or tried to pull away while I was filing her nails. It does the job of filing without hurting her precious newborn skin. I absolutely love it!,1
"We bought this playmat for a designated play space for my son, since we have hardwood floors throughout our apartment. This mat was well worth the investment, as it gives him a padded area to crawl around in and play on. We'll probably be purchasing 2 more sets soon, one to expand on the play area we currently have, and another for the play space he has in one of our other rooms.I love the different color options, and that the individual pieces have cut outs. One of the photos shows some of the pieces put together to form cubes for baby to play with, which is a fantastic alternative when you aren't using it as a mat!The mat is also easy to keep clean; I just vaccum over it when I'm doing the rest of the floor. We haven't had any liquid spills yet, so I don't know how badly a juice or milk spill might seep into the foam pieces.I highly recommend this mat for people who have hardwood floors and want a softer playspace for baby.",1
"This was the first toy that my baby was able to hold.  It is light and small (maybe three inches across, about the size of a bracelet), perfect for two month old hands.  I put it in her hand, and she was able to shake it.  The toy is easy to stick in my diaper bag.  What I love about the toy is the nice, soft rattle sound.  It's really pleasant and not annoying like other toys.  When the baby started teething, she enjoyed putting it in her mouth, and I was glad it is made of wood and safe dyes.I only wish she played with it more.  Although she always takes it from me when I offer it, the ring doesn't hold her attention for long.  For the price and the two minutes she will look at this toy, I'm not sure it is worth buying.  The only portable toy that has ever been able to keep her attention is chewing on the rubber Sophie giraffe.",0
"I love the long handle and shape of this spoon.  These spoons are not heat sensitive, but I don't think that feature is helpful on other spoons anyway.  These spoons work great for gently scrapping food off of baby's face and from the inside of a bowl.  They are also a soft plastic for when baby tries to chew on them.  I have not had any issues with staining.",1
"This was a gift, and it was exactly what I was looking for. Its perfect size for in a baby carrier and very soft too.",1
"I bought this at the same time as my American Baby sheets, all in the color Celery.  There was a distinct difference in the color on the skirt.  I returned this item and bought the American Baby sheets in a different fabric and they were fine.The quality was good and it fit my crib perfectly, but the color just clashed too much for me to be happy.",0
"this is a great stroller.  We searched around a lot for a stroller that was light, easily compactable, doesn't take up a ton of room in the trunk, offers great storage, great mobility, slim in shape to go down isles with ease and not feeling like you are in the way and the tires work great even in the grass.  this is a wonderful stroller and is everything we were looking for in a stroller.",1
These are the only pacifiers my kids use! I love that their BPA free. Great to use if you're breast feeding.,1
"The child-friendly travel pillow was well-made, adorable to look at and quite functional. It was stuffed less than an adult travel pillow but it seemingly molded to my grandson's neck more comfortably.",1
"We have the Britax Marathon Convertible Car Seat and this cup holder DID NOT fit.  The description shows that it fits on our seat, as does the description from the Britax website.  Unfortunately, I did not read other reviews before purchasing.  We had to return this due to it not fitting any where on our seat.  I couldn't even find a way to modify it in any way to make it fit.  We were very disappointed, the quality of the product was fine but I gave it 1 star because there was no possible way for us to use this, despite it saying on the box that it worked with our seat.  Amazon processed the return with no issues, so I recommend keeping the box and packaging it ships in just in case you need to return.",0
"Small, good battery, you can adjust sensitivity settings so you don't have to hear every tiny sound, my son dropped it 15 ft onto a tile floor & it still works well",1
"I really like Grovia Shells.  I've tried many others, but these really stand up well to many washings and everything in.  I don't love their liners for very small babies, but they are okay for older babies/toddlers.  I often use a different liner with the Grovia shell.  These shells are also great as swim diapers!",1
It's a good idea to have a spare cover on hand for wash day a must if you have a Boppy - these covers are designed to fit.,1
"This floor mat is excellent, there is nothing to improve. It is a great size, plus it is thin and lightweight and folds up very small. It is completely waterproof, and collects all the crumbs our toddler drops. Best of all, you can throw it in the washer with other bibs and baby items, and it comes out looking new every time. This is made out of the exact same material as the Bumkins bibs, which are the best bibs we have found. All of our bibs have been washed dozens of times and they look like they did the day we bought them. Great buy!",1
"The Dekor Plus refills always makes things easy when it comes to the diaper pale.  At first I was not sure if I liked having to buy a specific refill but since you can cut it to the size you want, if I feel like I need to take out the diapers it is easy and very cost effective because I don't feel like I am wasting.",1
"I bought a brand new 56"" hide-away bed safety rail for my two-year-old son from one step ahead directly and received it two days ago.  Just got time to open the box this afternoon.  I felt very disappointed about the condition because it's an used item which was returned by somebody else.  All the parts look not new. There are many scrachs on each rail and the number labels on the rails are old.  My husband and I still tried to assemble it because we didn't like to take complex steps to return things ordered online. We thought about keeping it if useable even if we felt very uncomfortable about its condition.  But when we assembled it, we found it was a defective item.  There are two ""U"" shaped cradles which are used to lock the rail.  The cradles are very important parts to the safety rail, but one of them are deformed which can't engage the spring loaded locking pin into the position.  There are some scratches around the locking hole in the ""U"" shped cradle which I believe was made by the previous buyer who must have tried to put the locking pin into the position but failed due to the deformed cradle. I believe this is the reason why the previous buyer returned this item. It's very dangerous to use the rail if it's not secured completely. This is a very irresponsible company which shipped such defective item to another customer.  Please never buy from this trustless company if you care about your little ones.",0
"This dresser is awesome, it arrived fully assembled and well packed. The detail on the front is impeccable as well as the paint job.  Excellent quality and you can't beat the price.",1
What this little potty doesn't show is that it comes with customization stickers so your child can put their name on it and flowers and decorate it however they want and the bowl of it comes out with more effort to discourage your child from trying to pour it out themselves. Ideal for me.,1
"I recently purchased a Porsche Carrera 911 (991) and was looking for car seats for my 5 and 3 year-old sons.  The 911 has VERY narrow bucket seats and I didn't think I was going to find anything that would fit, plus I didn't want to buy the marked up Porsche brand if possible.  One of the earliest reviews (thank you!) said that this seat fit his 911 (997) and so I ordered two in red....  and they fit perfectly.  As if they were made for the 911!!!  Also, in case anybody was wondering, this seat will also fit in the front seat of a Cayman or Boxster.  I also got the seats in red (Blaze) to match my red seat belts -- looks HOT.  And, I LOVE how you can see RECARO peeking out of the windows!!  Yes, Mommy is a racing/sports car enthusiast!All the bad reviews below have to do with the car seat being too narrow -- the reason probably being, this seat was made for sports cars.  As a reviewer pointed out below, this seat will work better in a bucket seat rather than a flat seat in the back.",1
"I was order this baby gym two weeks ago ,when I got it was totally different from website.I call for Amazon they let me order again,said will take care my new order sent me the other one same like the website baby gym,but let me down again!!!It's still mail the wrong baby gym for me!!!!Don't order it!",0
I was afraid of getting this because of comments about chemical smells. There was no chemical spell. It had a slight new plastic smell but nothing crazy. It makes the PNP a lot more comfortable and she now sleeps in it all night. :) So this was kind a life saver.,1
"I bought these because they are more environmentally friendly than disposables however they do not absorb much so I always end up changing my shirt because it leaks through. I don't consider myself a heavy-let-downer at all (ie. the disposables never got saturated) so I was very disappointed. They are also very flat. A little contour would be nice, and make more sense because really, who's breasts are totally flat? The only thing I like about these is that they seem to wash well and come with a mesh bag, which is convenient.",0
I've been searching for the perfect bathtub toy organizer and this is it! I was sick of the net bags that dont stay stuck on the wall and get yucky. This us great because the kids can just throw all the toys in easily after bath time and also have easy access to them as they sit in the tub.,1
My daughter likes this toy a lot and has played with it every day since Christmas. I just wish it came with extra balls because they just seem to disappear!,1
"This monitor is a complete waste of money. It keeps me up all night because it constantly looses signal and when it loses signal it beeps and the screen lights up. And just to clarify, it does not loose signal because it is too far away from the camera. Now after a couple months of use the battery does not hold charge. It only runs for an hour before it starts beeping that the battery is low. The base is shaped oddly and has a poor excuse for a belt clip. The clip does not serve it's purpose. And my final complaint is that there is no way to mount the camera. You have to set it on a shelf above the crib and then the cord hangs down creating a choking hazard. Do yourself a favor and keep looking....",0
"I've done a lot of research on which console to buy, I have the Phil&Ted's VIBE & this console is SO perfect! It's made for any stroller because of the 3 strap options - this is the ONLY console I've seen that keeps your drinks secure & can be in front or behind of the handlebar, which is perfect for me since I have it behind & low so it's out of the way - plus it doesn't look cheesy like a lot of the other products I've seen - I couldn't be happier with it, this is the #1 console for sure!",1
This product is as described. It is a clear mesh that is very strong.  It is very easy to install and easy to cut down to size. We installed it on a condo balcony and it fit just right. It only took a few minutes to unroll and tie on to the railings. Worth the price and the peace of mind for our 3 yr old grand daughter.,1
"The materials seem high quality for this crib set, however, the picture they show does not show the exact colors. Underneath the comforter is a bright lime green color, and everything else is pretty much lime green too! Do you see that in any of the pictures they show you? I don't! The set is A LOT brighter than the pictures show. Judging by the pictures, I assumed the set was pastel. The bib is the kind you have to tie in back, not a velcro one which I would think is much safer than the tying kind they send you in the set.  Well worth the price though. Much cheaper than any other place online. I'm expecting with a girl, so we'll see how the bright lime green and dark blue and plaid look in a purple room. :/",1
"I really like this set by Target. I received all the pieces I registered for, and found them to be comparable to other Target baby items. Since the sex of our baby is still a mystery, I think that this color scheme is perfect. We're also not into a bunch of foo-fooey baby pastels, so the line is great. All the blankets and sheets from the Circles line were very soft, even before we washed them. Some pieces were a little pricy, but they match all the in-store bargains, like additional white sheets and green or blue blankets, so new moms can easily add to the baby's room.",1
A little bigger in size than some of the other teething toys but great product for 3 months and up.,1
"I'm not quite sure what others were talking about when it came to this product being negative. The colors were exactly as shown in the picture, the quality is great, and the set is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo adorable! It goes absolutley perfectly with the theme I was going with. You honestly can't beat this price, and the product was probably worth quite a bit more. Fast shipping to canada, would defiantly buy from again, and recommend! The only negative thing I noticed was the bed sheet was a little bit lower in quality, but really, it's a bed sheet it's 10 dollars at walmart and you'll need lots anyways. Set has been washed and placed in crib, awaiting our little arrival.Thanks again you guys, fantastic company!",1
We bought this because of the good safety reveiws. We also liked it because it is nice looking. We get comments on how nice it looks. I don't recommend it to people because of the handle. It's VERY hard to put up and down. You have to crawl in the car and grab the release with both hands while pulling back and wrestling with it to get it to go down. Not very easy if you have small hands. My husband even has trouble with it sometimes. Also if it is raining and you are trying to get the baby in the car and the handle down you will get soaked. It's not a fast chore. Other than that it looks nice but I probably would get something different.,0
I've used this carrier on moderate hikes as well as shopping at the grocery store.  I use it to carry my son when I need my hands free.  He calms down right away as soon as his body is next to mine in this carrier.  Plus it is cool in temperature versus the heave nylon carrier.,1
The product arrived in good condition and as I paid for fast delivery I received it the next day.  Sheets are nice and soft.  I was a bit disappointed in the comforter as I was expecting a heavier. fuller stuffed comforter.  Will have to use a second blanket in the winter with this quilt.,1
I kept hitting the corner of my desk because the space around it is narrow.  I got tired of always having a big bruise on my leg & got these.  They have stayed on very well & provide good cushioning.  They also remind me to avoid the corners.  Either way I'm happy!!,1
"A boppy pillow is an absolute must for a nursing mother. I had one with my son, and knew that it was the one thing I would need for my new baby.  I probably got more use out of the boppy pillow than any other baby item (besides diapers!) It's perfect for baby to lie on while you're nursing, or even for baby to sleep on mom or dad's lap. It saves your back by keeping baby up a little higher than your legs, so you don't have to hunch over. It's also great to lay baby on the floor, since it props them up a little bit, but not too much.  The cover on this one is super-soft, and is even removable for washing, which helps a lot. The price is great, considering that a bare boppy pillow is typically thirty-five dollars, and each cover is at least twenty (not including the soft cozy ones, which are a little more). Overall great to have, I highly recommend it for a new baby.",1
"I love this bag, I don't have any other wet bags so i don't know what to compare it to but I know I want another one.",1
I purchased this changing table pad on Amazon.com and i absolutely love it!It seems to be very sturdy and is the perfect size.Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad,1
I have a rambunctious toddler who love to kick the back. This protects my car. I only wish there is something to protect the headrest--he can reach that high!,1
bought this to keep our small dog contained while doing removations to the house worked great stores nicley love the product,1
"I am sorry I bought this, my 4 month old baby girls feet don't touch the ground. This cannot be good for circulation in a babies legs if left in here. This thing went into the closet, probably better off, it's not really safe. That is why they have come out with better alternatives over the years. Maybe this should be done away with. Even to those who say they have no stairs, well there is the danger of the baby getting near the stove or under foot in the kitchen. And you have to make sure your basement door isn't left open, even if your on the first floor only, so I'm glad I'm not happy with this.",0
I am so glad I found this item. I didn't feel comfortable drying my baby's bottles in the dish rack next to other plates and cups. I always thought they should have a rack of their own until I saw this item. It's perfect and just what I needed. I have no complaints whatsoever.,1
Works great! My 4 month old has figured out how to start the music :) she loves it therefore mom and dad love it!,1
my daughter loves this toy. She loves all the littel features and it clips onto her car seat and she is happy as can bee.,1
"When my son was born almost two years ago I used a medela electric pump for the first 2 months.  It was loud, and painful.  It took me about 10 min per side to get 8 oz on each side.  I heard a friend talk about her avent pump and I went out and got one.  I loved it.  I was able to pump the same amount of milk as before but in half the time.  It was lightweight and quiet so I could use it anywhere and people did not know I was pumping.  My second child is due in about 3 months and I plan to use this pump from the start.  I recommend it to all my friends who are planning to breastfeed.",1
"It's difficult to purchase toys for a baby since they're frequently only interested in the box in which the toy arrives!  This toy is reasonable and my daughter does enjoy the ""bugs"".  She's probably a little too young (9 mos) to appreciate putting the bugs into the bucket via the slots in the lid and she really doesn't ""catch"" the bugs using the included net.  But the bugs are a great size and fun shapes for little hands and mouths.  I like that they all have different textures and sounds (rattles).  The firefly is a nice addition, but it is sometimes difficult to get the light to come on (more strength needed than a baby has to whack it against something to trigger the light).Overall it was a decent purchase, but I think more toys should have just a half-step up in quality so that I wouldn't worry about the seams/rattly bits when washing them for baby.",1
It is not as thick as the other Calendula cream so this is more appropriate for the not so dry months in the East Coast. I like that you don't have to worry about applying it to the child's face because it would not sting unlike regular cream. I don't know how natural this product is but that's what the product material says. We've bought many other brands and this one is the best we found.,1
The quality of the mat is amazing. Beautiful vibrant colors. My little boy loves sitting in boppy or bumbo and batting at the toys. They can be moved to different loops on the poles or the mat. I really love this and plan on using it with future babies because it is GN.,1
I was nervous about spending so much on a toy that my dog would potentially steal but my daughter loves it and talk to it all the time. She gnaws on it constantly and  would recommend.,1
"Like most moms I wanted the best for my baby. I thought the best ment expensive so I checked out the Dr.Browns bottles. The reviews sounded great, so I got them. At first I loved them, and would recomend them to anyone. A month down the road I got tired of spending a half hour washing 6 bottles a day(15 min. twice a day.) I went to the store and got the Playtex Nurser with the new nipple. At first I was doubtfull, then I tried it! Now not only do I save time washing bottles, my son is getting less air in his tummy. I spent 10 min. trying to burp him every way when I realized he didn't have to burp! So moms do yourself a favor even if you like Dr.Browns bottles and give the Playtex Nurser a try. They only cost a few bucks so your not out much if you don't like them.",0
"You get what you pay. Practical, okay quality, steady, safe, affordable. There are other hook-on chairs out there that are more expensive, but probably better quality. This chair however is perfect for us. Just what I was looking for. I was looking for something practical and affordable to use only for a few months while we are away from home. We have one chair similar to this back at home but of a better quality. I wanted something similar but I didn't want to pay too much. I am happy with the product. My baby likes it too! We can all sit and have dinner together around the table.",1
"The tutu runs a  little big, but still worked for our little girl.very cute and fun for our party.",1
"My son loves this gym.  He squeals and chatters away while playing on it.  It has been a lifesaver for me due to Jack being such a high need baby (Needs to be held most of the time, and more fussy than not).  He has spent over 45 minutes playing on this mat!!!  The music is really fun, and the lights are a nice touch.  Jack has been using this from about 2 months of age on, and loves to grab and shake the rattle (which is not cloudy on my mat) and will grab and shake the other toys at the same time.  It is so much fun to hear him having such a good time : )",1
this is the best thing you will ever get.the kids will like it and the people will like it to!  maybe some would love this!,1
I recently purchased the FisherPrice potty for my 18mo. old son because of the pee-pee guard & the fun ducky character. I found that the pee-pee kept adjusting itself wherefore wasnt very useful. Also the sensor inside the potty kept activating even if he didn't make a pee-pee and/or poop.,0
If anyone is reading this has had problems with the wheels sticking all you need to do is pop out the front wheels there is a quick release button and spray wd40 on the metal peg and some inside if you like and then pop them back in.  It will fix the problem with the front wheels not turning.  I did it over a year ago and haven't had any problems since.  Love this stroller I can't complain about one thing.  My favorite is that it folds up small and very lightweight.  Hope this helps someone out there.,1
"Sometimes he put it on the small potty, but most of time he carries it as a baby toy.The nappy is too tiny, anyway it's still very good.",1
"This is one of the very few bags out there that can work for both guys and women.  It's made out of durable canvas and has a decent amount of pockets. Also, it gets discounted fairly often on Amazon. I am not a huge fan of the Diaper Dudes logo on the outside of the bag - not a big deal at all, just don't want the bag to be explicitly labeled as such.Ultimately, I ended up returning this bag and using a different Diaper Dude bagDiaper Dude Messenger II Diaper Bag, Black.  It is larger and made out of a nicer material, but it is also more expensive.  Both bags would work well.",1
"This is a great size to carry with you; it folds up flat so it's not taking up space unless something is in it.  I can put one soiled diaper in it and fold it over, or put several in it and it will be full--either way, works great for the purpose.  I have not had any problems with leakage or the smell escaping and affecting other things in the bag.  I also wash it about every 2-3 days and have had no problems with the quality.",1
"This stroller has been great to have.  My baby is now 2 weeks old, and we've already taken a stroll in the early evening around the block.  He falls right to sleep, and the ride is so smooth.  I know this stroller is a bit more expensive, but it's worth every penny. It strolls like a Mercedez!  The options are great:  reversable handle so you can watch your baby while you stroll, fully reclining seat so baby can sleep, just like a bassinet, adjustable handle for different heights, and beautiful fabric. I have no complaints!  It's a must....and the matching car seat fits perfectly for travel.",1
"This is a very well designed and useful baby tub. It is designed with the idea of being adjustable to your baby's size as he/she grows. It features a sling that is ideal for a newborn baby, and a removable padded seat that is more suitable for a slightly older child, all the way up to 25 lbs. The tub can be easily positioned inside your regular bathtub, or angled inside a larger washing sink. The tab has a small hook which lets you hang it to dry after use. It also has a couple small bathing accessories, which both you and your baby will sure be able to enjoy and appreciate.The tub is very sturdily built. In my experience most of flimsier tubs develop small cracks with prolonged use, but I am much more optimistic about this tub's long term durability.",1
When unpacked this 13 piece set I couldn't help but notice the poor quality of stitching and how cheap each item was.  Granted compared to other bed sets this is relatively cheap for 13 pieces but don't be fooled it's no bargain at all.  This set would would nicely for a grandparents house or somewhere that isn't your child's primary bed.  Beside that it's worth investing in something a little more substantial.  The stitching was extremely poor and look rushed and unfinished.  The bears nose stitched in black on the bottom on the blanket looked like a quick zig-zag patten instead of a seamless black nose.  The pillow was thin and useless as well as the bib but all in all most of the items are just filler so they can call it a 13 piece set.  Once again not good for a primary bed set but as a bargain deal for grandparents house etc. it's worth giving a shot.  We have already returned ours and for about 20 dollars more and about 5 pieces less got a quality set for our child.,0
"I love this set. It was so hard for me to find a crib set that didn't have characters on it, wasn't gender specific, or was contemporary. Sometimes I'll go into my daughter's room (she's 9 months) and just admire her bedding. The shipping was quick and efficient considering I have an APO address. And if I could buy one for my kingsize bed I would.",1
helps to keep from making bath water too warm for my lil munchkins. Would recomend this to all parents and grandparents for the safety of bathimg.,1
"We purchased this gate because we have a very narrow set of stairs leading to the basement and most gates are too big.  We couldn't install it as low as would have been ideal because we have baseboards with quarter rounds at the bottom and the bottom piece that the gate retracts into is fairly large.  This left a gap of about 3-4 inches between the gate and the floor.  There is also give to the fabric even when it is locked, and the first day it was up, our (admittedly very active) 8-month-old got under the gate and fell down the basement stairs.  It was also somewhat difficult to install.  The gate has the advantage of retracting and so blending in relatively well.  It would be a decent gate to use between rooms but the other reviewers were right that this is not a good top-of-the-stair gate!",0
"This is an EXCELLENT tool to have when your infant/toddler has a stuffy nose.  It's a low pressure snot sucker... gets stuff out of the nasal cavity quickly and is a cinch to clean.  If you have any doubts about it, try it on yourself and you'll see that it won't harm baby... just a slight inconvenience for them.  Saved us many nights of non-stop crying because of nasal conjestion!!  We give it as our ""new baby"" gift now and our friends say that it's excellent.",1
"I bought this so I can have my Skip Hop Diaper bag for our new baby and travel lighter for my 2.5 y/o. It's adorable,great quality and serves it's purpose. Perfect for holding extra change of clothes, snacks and drink! This will probably even last until new baby gets older. Although we are not using this for school I don't see why someone wouldn't choose this.",1
Does exactly as specified.  Works well and have had no problems so far.  Seems to hold a good deal of weight.,1
"We bought another gate we loved it so much.  It fits all our entryways and is easy to put up and down, even one handed while holding a baby!",1
"We have just started to use cloth diapers now that my baby is around 10 months old. I ordered 5 of the size 2 AppleCheeks. I really really want to love these diapers. They are Canadian made, very cute and the company that makes them is quite cool and started/run by a couple of moms!  Maybe it is only since my baby is still only around 21 pounds and so is close to the beginning of the weight range for the size 2s. But they are pretty bulky on her, especially between the legs and the rise is high at the back...sticks out of her pants! I also have a set of Sunbaby pocket diapers in size 2 to compare. I hate to admit that I like the Sunbaby diapers better! It kind of hurts to say this because they were literally around 1/3 the price of these and are made in China! But the Sunbabys seem well made too and honestly fit my little girl better than the AppleCheeks. I hope this is just because my daughter is not quite big enough for them yet! Other than the fit, they have not leaked for us and we are using the company's new Stay Dry Microterry inserts. I like the inserts...they are fairly trim and fit nicely into the pockets. However I would be willing to guess that these inserts would NOT be good for the size 1 diapers. They are quite long and fit perfectly into the size 2s. I can't imagine being able to fit them into a smaller diaper without folding them in half! And this would make them way too bulky.  Just be aware if you are buying size 1s for a young baby...better to go with another type of insert in my opinion.  In all the AppleCheeks diapers are beautiful...I totally hate covering them up with clothes so I cant wait for summer when she can just run around in a diaper and t-shirt! :) But I find the Size 2s bulky for a 20-22 pound baby...hopefully these will become my favourites when she is larger and then the high price will be justified!",1
"I love watching my baby girl. The Britax Back Seat mirror helps me do it more. I just have to remember not to use it too much while driving - gotta keep my eyes on the road! This mirror is very easy to install and to adjust. We have it on the right back headrest with the carseat in the middle. On our other car, the carseat is on the right side and the mirror is too. Unfortunately, this does not work as well. I can only see baby girl when I turn around and look in the mirror (when I'm stopped), but you can't blame a mirror for working like a mirror.",1
"it's perfect. fits my first years ignite. keeps the kid warm and dry, and has a nice window so she can see out.",1
"This was much cheaper online than in the store and I thought it was silly to even get due to how many night lights my daughter already had.  This turned out to be different, it is easy to move from room to room and in a dark room it will beam stars and a moon onto the ceiling and walls in three different colors.  There is something relaxing about this effect and I find myself turning it on at night and looking at the stars.  My daughter loves it as well, and it automatically shuts off after about an hour, batteries have lasted almost 3 months at this point so it does not eat through batteries quickly at all.  Solid product for sure.",1
It is good. My son is enjoy a lot in it. When I am in work I put him in his chair.,1
We use this mainly when we go out to eat and some times at people's houses.  Our daughter likes it b/c it's different and it's not the standard restaurant high chair.  It is pretty sturdy but if your child wiggles a lot they might be able to knock the chair over.  The only thing is that part that goes over the tummy area is too low and a bit flimsy.  Our friends with kids usually like it when they see it.  I'm glad we bought it :),1
"Added this item to our existing furniture after finding out we were expecting another child. It was a great addition! Love the color and there was plenty of room on top for the table padding as well as a little basket at the end for nursery items. The only complaint I had is that it was difficult to get a mobile to stay on the table. I had a mobile that had a turn cap to securely attach to the railing. However, since the railing is round, it didn't work out as well as I had hoped. But, I wouldn't send the table back due to that small issue!",1
This has been my best baby purchase by far.  I SOO wish I had purchased this with my first child rather than waiting until my third to buy it.  We had the big clunky high chairs for my first 2 kids but when we moved to a house with a teeny kitchen/dining space we couldn't find room for it.  We have only 5 chairs to a dining table that can fit 6 so we had to find a solution that wouldn't take up too much space or another chair.  We have 2 other children in booster seats.  I researched several hook on chairs and the problem with them was that NONE of them had trays!!  I found that gross for a 5 month old who was very into self feeding but not quite ready for a plate.  This was a HUGE plus for me and it has been amazing!  the tray is just the right size and super easy to clean!  I am inlove with the fact that it swivels to be able to spoon feed.  I would have liked to see a 5 point harness but this was just fine.  As far as cleaning i haven't had a problem undoing the fabric and tossing it in the wash.  We have the black and yellow one so it hasn't been stained plus if you get some sauce on it you just spray and wash it as soon as they are done and it's fine.  There are some crevices that get food stuck in them on occasion (because the fabric wasn't put back on properly) but i just took the thing to the sink and used the sprayer and everything came out fine.  I was a little nervous spending the money on something like this but I am so glad I did it has been the best purchase I have made.  I just wish I knew about this awesome thing sooner!,1
"Both the customer-posted images and reviews were pretty positive, so we figured we would give this a shot for our 12-week old.  Well, the somewhat underwhelming looking packaging aside, the product itself was exactly as advertised. In a fully darkened room, it displayed a convincing 'moving waves' seascape... and it caught our daughter's attention very well. We use it every night now, and purchased another for a friend with a newborn. Maybe as they refine the product they could consider a couple things to help the retail appeal of an already good product; 1) more polished packaging. Many consumers prejudge a product based on the 'OOBE,' so a bit more design work might help buyers in a retail environment. 2) Consider adding some looped soothing sounds.  We use our projection unit combined with a white noise generator, and maybe other infants/kids would like that as an option as well.Great little product - just remember to use it in a dark room and your little one will enjoy it!",1
"This cup lasted about two weeks before we threw it away. It was a good size and shape, although the base part with the handles didn't fit onto the cup part quite as tight as desirable. However, the valve kept coming loose from the lid and floated around inside, even though it was only a few weeks old. This allowed water to pour out. After too many puddles on the floor and on my daughter, I gave up on it. If you are okay with not having a valve in the cup for an older child this would be a good cup.",0
"The quality is very good,Material security, so I can rest assured that the use of,We recommend the use of this brand",1
The delivery time was good and the product was a great buy.  There were really more pieces than I needed for decor and I will give the extra stuff to friends.,1
I like the fact that when i make a bottle I'm sure it is clean. These liners make going out of the house a lot easier. No need to worry about cleaning the bottles. i just take extra liners and nipples in my bag.,1
"I was looking at a bunch of different entertainers for my daughter who is approaching 6 months and am so glad I bought this one!!! First, she absolutely loves it. Second, it is not a huge monstrosity of a play center. It was super easy it put together and easy to clean. You can attach extra toys using any links that you have as well, which is great when your little one gets bored of something and needs new challenge.Added bonus is the extra piece they give you to insert in the seat area if your little one is still on the small side. It helps with stabilty for your munchkin. My daughter is pretty steady even though she is on the thin side so I dont use it but it woiuld have had I bought this earlier.Trust me, you will not be disappointed if you purchase this excersaucer. :)",1
These are a waste of money.  They do not work.  It also pinches your finger if it gets twist around the finger,0
I love these bibs and use them for every feeding with my ten month old. The pocket always stays open to catch the food and she can even reach into the pocket and grab the food she dropped!,1
My little guy (three months) loves this teether so much I came back to order another. So many teethers are so big there is no way younger babies can get them into their mouths. This one is the perfect size for small babies to hold,1
we swaddled our baby for almost 3 months and rotated between two of these every night... it really is awesome and works much better than other blankets I tried... don't waste time or money trying anything else - this was really the best solution!!!,1
I sent this as a baby gift to a friend in Canada whose daughter just had her first grandson.  they only speak French and thought this outfit was so adorable .  French beret and all!!!!,1
"I bought three different slings all in various price ranges and styles to figure out which one worked best for me and my baby.  This sling is very well made, the fabric feels great, but my baby just didn't love it.  I felt awkward wearing it, and it just wasn't the right match for my family.  I ended up loving the Ergo carrier and how versatile it is.  I ended up returning this sling, but it was probably more of a personal preference thing because the sling is really nice, it just wasn't right for me.",0
"After a superb amount of effort to get my son's foot print and handprint in the clay, we let it dry and it cracked across his prints.  Awful.",0
"This is a great set for a toddler/preschooler. The colors are vibrant and the fishy design is exciting for the kids. The cups are perfect. My only complaint is that the bowls and plates are a little on the small side. So if you're looking for a deeper bowl or ""dinner size"" plate, then you should skip this set. If you're getting it in conjunction with other plates/bowls that are bigger, then this is a perfect addition to that. Also, I love that they can go in the dishwasher & they're BPA free!",1
The kids adored these little things and even played in the pool with them! They had a blast!! The cutest little gift for the kids! IT was definitely worth the price! & SPEEDY DELIVERY!!,1
"Almost perfect - love everything about these plates, however they don't stack. That is the only downside - otherwise they are durable (not only do they stand up to baby throwing them on the floor! also seems to be doing just fine going through the dishwasher on the top rack). I had gotten some other toddler plates on Amazon and the plate shattered when baby threw it on the floor the first time :(  These plates here are much more durable.  Also, I like that these plates are colorful.",1
"I have bought one with handles for my baby. He loves it, but it has worn out. So I got this one for him.",1
"My 13-month-old breastfed baby started using this cup 2 weeks ago, and immediately her nursing latch suffered to the point where I have sustained serious breast injury, am in severe pain, and have recurring breast infections (I have even started to wean her because of this, although I had originally planned to let her self-wean).This cup did teach her quickly to use a straw (she learned on the first attempt), but I think the design is such that she has to bite the rather rigid part at the top before anything will flow.  Hence the breast damage.If you are not nursing, I think this would be a great product, because it seems my baby was able to learn how to use the straw extremely fast.  However, if you are still nursing, I strongly urge you to avoid this product and just teach your child how to use a cup, or get a cup with a very basic straw.",0
We are so happy that we returned the one we initially bought at Babies R Us.  This one actually bounces.  Our son loves it and it is pure fun for the whole family.  Highly recommend this one!,1
"I'm writing this under my husband's account. My son is 5 months old and is 18 pounds 6 ounces and he is just about 27 inches long. He is the ""go-go-go"" type that wants to be picked up and carried around so he can see everything. He is wlling to walk as long as he has help so I decided to buy him a walker.I was so pleased to find that this walker was so EASY to assemble. Just unfold, attatch wheels, seat and the toys and you're ready to put your baby in it! My son took off in it the second I let him go! He can't move on carpet yet (we have very low pile carpet), but I'm thinking he just needs to be a little stronger first so he can support his weight better. It is VERY easy for him to move on hardwood and I love the rubber bumpers on the bottom because we have a single step in the house and I was worried he might fall so, as I held the walker, I let him get close to the step and sure enough he got completely STUCK! The seat also adjusts in between the leg holes on the back, which is good for me because I have a tall baby. My son loves the Cookie Monster teether because he loves to chew on things with his two little bottom teeth. I love that there is a tray in between the toys and even a handy-dandy cup holder, haha.I chose this walker because it converts into walk-behind walker. All you do is remove the seat and flip the bar forward and wa-la, done. I would definetly recommend this to anyone.",1
"I LOVE these baby spoons.  They are a pricier than other baby spoons, but we find ourselves just using these ones over and over again instead of our other ones.  The spoon is perfectly shaped to hold the right amount of food and for baby to get all the food out of the spoon.  With other spoons, I find that there's always a little food left in the bowl of the spoon after he takes a bite.  This spoon gives the perfect bite of food every time - cuts down a lot on the mess!  I also like that it has a soft silicone tip, so it's easy on my baby's gums.  We wash them on the top rack of the dishwasher and have never had any problems with them.  Great quality and great design!",1
"I like the lock, however the sticky tape that comes with it does not hold well.  I need to get some better tape and then it may stay on better.  It does at lease deter my daughter and she hasn't tried to open it since I put it on the oven.",0
"I waited and waited for these smaller animal bags to come out.  I thought the large, double, and triple bags were overkill.  Who has that many stuffed toys?  Well, it turns out that we do.  When this came I shoved, and stowed, and pushed, and bashed until almost all of our toys were in.  This bag is probably about the size of a full kitchen trash bag.  We have a few more stuffies than that and keep accumulating more somehow.  Fortunately the zipper seems to be made of sturdy stuff as we are taxing it with our load and it still glides easily enough for our 18 month old to open.  I am going to have to buy another one for the leftovers.  At this price I need to wait a bit (and dropped a star), but the good news is that the kids love it.  They have played with their stuffed toys more since we have had this bag than ever before.  I love that you can see what is inside, that the zipper pull is large, and that the top opens wide for easy rummaging.  Great job again Boon.",1
This crib is beautiful.  When compared to much higher priced furniture it looks just as good for half the price. I wasnt sure what to expect and was pleasantly suprised.  All the pieces came with it and no trouble to assemble. My husband and I (mostly my husband) put it together in under an hour. I would definitely recommend this set.,1
"not an amazing product, but does its job. Well packed and can be assembled with some problem but not much.",0
i got this walker for my baby to use when we go to visit family. its easy to take apart and transport as well as easy for the baby to move around especially on carpet and hardwood floors. its roomy and spacious and provides hours of fun.,1
"I had read and heard many great things about Britax car seats, and they are all true!  The seat fits easily into my Honda CR-V, and installed securely without any problems.  The fabric is very soft and better quality than I expected.  My son loves to run his hands over the material!  We transferred him from his infant car seat to the Boulevard when he was 7-months old.  He loves sitting higher and having more room to squirm.  I am extremely happy with my purchase and would definitely buy another Britax product in the future!",1
"This toilet trainer is great! It's sturdy, secure, no folding up parts, which means there's no chance of pinching tiny bottoms! It's sleek enough to fit in the diaper bag without a lot of fuss, so I sometimes take it on the road with us. I highly recommend it.",1
Lovely large muslin swaddle. Hubby loved swaddle guide sewn to muslin as we are first time parents. Very happy with purchase,1
"We really liked this swaddle for the first 10 weeks of our daughter's life. Easy to use and seemed to stay put better than other swaddles. But as she's gotten bigger - and stronger - I've found her out of it and often with the arms of the blanket wrapped in curious positions around her. Once I saw that, I realized that the days of the Snug n Tug were over for our little one. If you have a strong baby who fights to get his/her arms free regularly, just be careful with this one and watch for any tangling.",1
bought for the ignite stroller and our graco signature jogging stroller. adjustable and fits both without an issue. The cup holder is big enough for the Tommy straw sippy cups. great product and reasonable cost,1
"I thought it was easy to put together, I don' like that I did have to use a screw driver for 3 of the items. The other hard part was the putting on the cloth it was hard for my big had to get to the last hole.My baby loves it and was crazy about all the stuff on it. I like that it has three height levels. It's not heavy and easy to move from room to room.",1
This is the most amazing product I've purchased for my twins.  Saves our expensive cribs on a daily basis.  Wash up beautifully and the chocolate brown is rich.  Highly recommend.,1
My Four month old son just outgrew his infant seat. He still weighs below the 20 pounds it can carry but he has outgrown it in height.....26 inches is the max and he is 27 1/2. After doing research online and reading all of the reviews I decided to go with a Britax Marathon as it seemed like the safest option. This car seat is worth every penny you will pay for it. These are the reason why:1. It installs in about 5 minutes flat. The instructions are easy to read and follow and the latch belts make it a breeze to install.2. The seat cushion is padded and comfortable as well as being soft. The fabric is also very durable.3. The HUGS sit perfectly on the baby's neck and protect them from the straps rubbing against delicate skin.4. The belly pad keeps the buckles from pressing uncomfortably on your little one.5. I drive a Chevy Malibu.....The Graco Snugride was a tight fit in my rear passenger side seat.....The Britax marathon fits perfectly.6. My son adores the cow print and loves to watch himself and look at it in the Baby in Sight mirror.7. My son screamed bloody murder everytime he was in his Graco Snugride and there were few car rides where he did not scream the entire time he was in the back seat. The first time he ever was in the Marathon he babbled happily and then went right to sleep. He has no complaints about the Marathon.8. My son is not sitting up yet although he holds his head up very well. I have had no problems with his head hanging forward in the seat while he is sleeping. (This was a problem even in the Snugride) The HUGS keep his little head right where it should be.I feel this was the best investment we have ever made in an item of baby equipment. I could not be more pleased.,1
"the muff simply sits into the stroller seat with no additional straps to securely strap it into the seat like other muffs do.  So each time you open your carriage you have to wiggle it around into place digging around to get the stroller straps thru the muff holes so that you can safely seat your baby into the stroller. Not convenient especially during cold winter months when you want to open your stroller, place baby in and go!...and when you pay top dollar for a City Mini GT you would expect the Citi Mini asseccories to be at a certain standard.",0
"Great seat! Love everything about it! It was easy to put in, my son seams comfortable and I love the safety of this brand.",1
I get a lot of products online and now the UPS guy has started ringing the door bell for deliveries. The door bell is one thing that does wake my baby up even with her door shut. This sign is great for the first few weeks when people come over while YOU are trying to sleep too! Very cute and looks nice on the wreath hanger on my front door.,1
"This is the best gate.  Before we had children, we had a basset.  The need for gates became apparent once we moved to a larger home.  We ended up with door ways which are larger than standard doorways.  We tried lots and lots of other gates.  This was the only one that we could get to fit and that would open easily and leave an adult with two hands free (which after baby entered the picture became a very important item.)  We love this gate, and in fact, still have one gate in place even though the ""baby"" is now four and the basset is now seven.  It's sturdy, easy for an adult to open and has held up really well.  I would definitely recommend it!",1
"We loved the shower feature a lot. It was the only good thing about it. Untill about 4 months of use. Then the hose that connects the shower head just cracked off! Just like that, with out warning! We now realized how poor quality the shower mechanisim is. Botom line, if your are concidering buying it for the shower feature, don't buy it! Rather look into a cheaper tub and buy a hose that attaches directly to the faucet. I saw such a product from Sassy on Amazon for about nine dollars. Don't know much about it, but it might be worth giving it a shot.",0
My daughter loves wearing her panda.  So far we used it at the library and some family festivals.  We still hold her hand while she wears it.  It just gives us added security in large crowds.  We will definitely be using it at the airport.,1
"Everybody knows that babies love tags on stuff. So, why not make a product with lots and lots of tags instead of just one? That's what the Taggie folks did. If you want a happy baby, give 'em a Taggie product and watch the baby sigh with contentment as he fingers the Taggie tags.",1
"I want one for every room! A space for everything. Good price, great product. We have had for a year now.",1
We bought this safety strap for our old-fashioned high chair that didn't have a strap. This one works great and was affordable!,1
This adorable First Love Bug Doll is just the right size for little hands.  It is soft and cuddly and will be loved and slept with by any little girl every night.,1
"Nothing revolutionary about a set of sheets, but the fabric on these was nice and the bedspread has a warm texture.  Our son loves it.",1
"I first saw this pillow in the baby store when my husband and I went to register for our baby shower.  I have to admit, at first glance I thought, ""Well that seems a little too involved...""  The only pillow I'd ever seen anyone with was one of the U-shaped ones (i.e. a Boppy type pillow) so we picked one of those instead.  Skip ahead a few months:  our sweet son was born and I was having a lot of issues with trying to nurse him the first few weeks.  A lactation consultant came to my house to help and brought one of these pillows with her.  She strapped it on me and after about five minutes of tweaking some of my positioning, my son latched on properly!  I was ecstatic and went the very next day to get one for myself!Have used it ever since and have not had any more difficulty or issue with nursing.  The pillow securely straps on and has a flat surface (with a slight raise where the baby's head goes) so that the baby will not shift or roll should you change positions.  Not only does it provide great back support, but it is also possible to get up and walk around while still nursing- something I think I'll appreciate more one day when we have more children who need my attention hehe.  The first few months I took this pillow with me wherever I went; it has a strap so it attaches right onto the stroller when out and about.  Can't say enough good things about it (obviously!).  I HIGHLY recommend getting one to aid with breast-feeding.  On a side note we also used this to help my son with sitting up on his own; we would sit him in the middle with the strap snapped together.  Worked great b/c if he started to tilt backward the pillow wouldn't move away from him but stayed in place, keeping him from falling back (hope that makes sense!)Also want to mention that they have EXCELLENT customer service and support.  I contacted the company with a small issue I was having and they went above and beyond any expectations I had to help resolve the issue quickly.  Love companies like this who care about their products and customers!",1
"I was looking for a replacement for the sacks I was previously using, that were pretty sturdy and eco friendly, but which scent I could simply not stand any more (the green n pack eco friendly). I ordered these and the fresh sacks roll 250 count. This product has a pleasant scent, but the bags are of bad qualiy - very flimsy, and the handles break 2 times out of 3. I also do not like that they are folded rather than in a roll, it ends up being a complete mess on the changing station. The qualiy of the green n pack is undeniably the best of the 3 but the scent is too strong, chemical and obnoxious (I ended up preferring thr smell of dirty diapers !) . All in all the fresh sacks roll is my preferred for now. The bags are also very thin but at least they come in a roll and the handles do not break. They are also slightly thicker than the classy kid keep me tidy.",0
"If I could give this thing 0 stars, I would.  It's a better baseball than it is a nasal aspirator.  You can squeeze it all you want, but it'll never suck anything up.  Absolutely useless, the material is too solid to provide any type of suction and there is no give in the material.",0
"I haven't actually had a chance to use the crib for my baby yet - she's still growing for 3 more months, but we bought the crib early because I loved it and I didn't want to miss my chance at getting this crib.  It looks great and feels incredibly sturdy.  I am positive my daughter will be safe in it.  It's a great crib to let her grow with so we never have to worry about storing it when she's bigger.  We built it already just to make sure we had all the parts.  It wasn't missing a single piece.  I highly recommend this crib to anyone :)",1
"Having this monitor for 2 MONTHS now, I would give it 5 Stars. No need to bore you all with tons of info as this monitor is SUPER EASY. You plug in the camera and monitor and you're in business. No interference from 100's of townhouses around us, and no interference from top floor to bottom floor garage. Camera moves up and down and scans around 200 degrees of a room. Monitor doesn't give you a 360 degree picture, but it's not supposed to. Everything about this monitor is great from sound (picks up the lightest whimper / whisper) to picture in daylight or pitch dark. Nightly we plug in the receiver to charge; never changed batteries. We recommend it to all our friends.",1
We had someone give us this in the hospital for our first - it is by far the easiest way to swaddle! We ordered two more so we will never be without it.,1
"We have attempted to use this on at least a dozen different occasions--from birth to 6 weeks, each time, hoping for a different outcome.  We WANTED to love it.  Sadly, our son (born at 7lbs, now 11) hates it with a passion.  Now, to be fair, he hates all swaddles, but this one is the worst.  He screams from the moment he gets in it to the second we take him out..which isn't long, because he's so miserable.  He fights the other velcro-type ones, and a general blanket swaddle too at first, but eventually settles and is ok.  Not the case with the woombie.My advice--all kids are different, so before you invest in a swaddle, borrow a few first and see what your kid will like.  They can get expensive--especially if they hate it!",0
I love these bibs. Lovely quality and stylish with various uses. I now buy these for friends when they have a baby and everyone loves them.,1
"I got this stroller, because I have a 5 1/2 month old and a 4 year old nephew. I love taking them places together, but it can get hard. This stoller is amazing for that! It has 20 different positions and can carry any Graco carseat! It has every option that you could possibly think of. It is heavy, but all doubles are and they normally don't have as many different seating (or standing) options. It rides very smoothly. Overall, I am extreamly happy and wish I thought to get something like this sooner! Now I can cart the kids off to many place without much hassle!",1
"This product is fine, if a bit bulky on the baby. But that's also due to the diaper underneath. It's washable, which is great. They are bigger than i expected--my baby was six weeks old before he was big enough (9 lbs) to wear them.",1
It is a Beautiful necklace. I had Great service! Not sure if it works however I will keep trying it though!,1
I bought it for my granddaughters for Christmas.  They wanted a night light and this one looked fun.  The lights change color if you want or stay in one color.  They love it.  They had it for about a week and one of the lights stopped working.  I contacted Amazon and they had a new one in less than 2 days and this one works perfect.  The product and the service so far have been outstanding.  Thank you.,1
Few weeks before actual use but it arrived today and already have a few things for the negative.Arrived a day latePackage for mattress was cut (apparently by zorro)Mattress is larger than standard (super tight fit into crib)For positive:Both sides are marked and appropriate firmness for bothMore to come after baby arrival,0
"Can't beat a carseat that will take your child from toddler to 120lbs! Seems very safe and sturdy, I am happy with the purchase. The 2 cup holders are great, can hold a drink and a snack- perfect for our weekend trips to the beach. I like that the bottom of it has a large 'flap' so it can recline a bit when in the car with harness mode. The only down side is that it has taken my son a little while to get used to the harness straps, he keeps saying it scratches his neck. Not a deal breaker, but I think the padding could be a bit better. But as a flaw, I am sure it is more a personal one. Bottom line, I would def recommend to a friend.",1
they are cute and soft. I fed the baby by the spoon and gave him the fork for chewing fun. He loves the texture.,1
"This bottle is specifically designed to help babies latch on better and learn to breastfeed better. You don't have to worry about nipple confusion with this bottle if u are using it to give the baby pumped milk while u are at work, have to supplement with formula or anything like that. Alot of moms have reported that their babies no longer have latching problems etc after using this bottle. It actually helps babies to breastfeed better. This is the only bottle our family uses, we used them for our son and now our newborn little girl. Definitely worth every penny.",1
"As another reviewer said, this product is under-marketed... it can be used alone (not as an extension) as a rail for shorter staircases. I installed it easily during nap time. I easily connected two of these together, the ends snap together in an included connector piece.",1
Keeps dirty diapers from stinking up or car or others trash cans when on the go.  I would recommend this to any mom or dad,1
"Every week we were bringing a bottom sheet, a blanket, a travel pillow and a travel pillow case to daycare.  Invariably we forgot one or more item every week.  I saw this and thought it might really simplify things.  Its SO cute, I love the colors and love the way it rolls up easy like a mini yoga mat.  My daughter loves it too and we used it on a trip before taking it to preschool.  At the end of the week, I just toss it in the washer and dryer, I just have to remember to remove the pillow and replace it before Monday morning.  I am very pleased with this item.",1
This was the most unprofessional company I have ever dealt with.  The rep used profanity against a pregnant woman and then proceded to call my house directly twice to curse my wife again.  Save your grief and buy from a more reputable vendor that doesnt have anger management issues.,0
"My son is three months old and has had a pretty significant flat spot since he was about 6 weeks old. We started using this pillow a month ago, and haven't really seen any improvement. We use it when he's in his bouncer, swing, car seat and on his activity mat. We really don't have him in those things for long periods of time, so I wonder if that's why we don't see much difference. I wish we could use this for sleeping, as he sleeps 8-10 hours a night and I'm sure that's where the flatness is coming from. The pillow is well-made, but it's still really expensive for what it is. I could probably have made something similar myself for a couple of bucks, but who has the time for that? We'll keep using it (along with lots of tummy time!), and we are still hopeful we will see improvement soon!",0
our baby likes the soft part but not the handle so I remove the soft part and transplant it into glow in the dark handles from walmart,0
"I purchased this item a little over 7 months ago. I have purchased many other Bright Starts products and they have been great so I decided this would likely be great too. I'm sad to say I was extremely disapointed with it and a total waste of money. It was falling apart before I could even get it out of the box! The rattle ball fell off and I had to sew it back on, the elastic band of the pull cord was shot, and the battery was dead. I'd have spent almost as much shipping it back as what I spent on it so I kept it. I then tried to attach it to the carrier and had to immeadiately remove it because no matter how I tried to place it hung directly in the baby's face. I give this 2 stars because even though it didnt work out, it was super cute and a good idea.Found that in my case it was much better to buy individual hanging toys.",0
I read several reviews and decided that even if the Cloud B Lamb wasn't used to soothe and calm the new baby it surely would be a wonderful companion to stroller or any other baby item.  When the item arrived it was so wonderfully soft and sweet that it inspired me to look for similar Lamb items.,1
"I purchased this products despite the fact that it was a bit pricey. I thought it was a great idea, being adhesive and reusable. Unfortunately, I spent the whole school year pressing down on them as they would always be separating from the wall. Maybe you will have better luck, I will not buy this type of item again.",0
"Ordered two and it is the perfect solution to safely contain toddlers when they wouldn't be safe crawling about. Perfect, entertaining solution.",1
"I LOVE this product!  When I first got it, I was already thrilled to feel how soft the materal was. Not only is it soft and sleek, but you can feel the elasticity in the material, so I'm not worried about it cracking or being to rigid for my little one. I was a little concerned  that because it's compact, it wouldn't fit my baby for a very long time. After seeing it in person, I think this will work great for at least the first 3 to 6 months. It fits nicely in both my bathroom sink and in my kitchen sink. There is some texture on the outside so it grips a little to the surface of the sink/counter. There are also slits on either side so that you can't overfill it. I really can't say enough about this product! Perfect for everyday use, awesome for traveling. Folds completely flat for the suitcase, and/or so you can hang it agains the wall (there is a little loop to use on a hook). And while bathing newborns in the sink is for sure easiest on your back, I always had to clean and disinfect the sink beforehand. Now I can just place the Flyte bath in my sink and wipe down the outside of the bath when I'm done. It doesn't get any easier then that. Also,as a side note, my daughter had open heart surgery and it was awesome to help bathe while we avoided the chest area. This should be given to small babies with heart surgery to use or borrow after surgery, a useful tool. Thanks for another great baby product!!!!",1
"When it says storage caddy, I assumed there would be more storage. It's more like a basket with a single pocket on the back.",1
"I love the Playtex drop-ins system in general. My 2 1/2 month old does very well with these bottles. I had to go back to work full-time at 8 weeks so the convenience of this system is great. I have a Medela Freestyle pump and I bought thePlaytex Nursing Necessities One Step Breast Milk Storage Kitso that I can pump directly into the drop ins. It saves me a lot of bottle washing time. However, my big complaint with this system is the nursers themselves. I've had to buy 3 different sets because they keep getting warped. First my husband boiled them to sterilize them, not realizing it was just the nipples that were supposed to be boiled before first use. They shrank and warped. Then he put one in the bottle warmer (against my advice) and it also warped. I understand that Playtex advises against boiling these bottles, but would it really be such a big deal to manufacture them with plastic that could withstand a little heat?",0
"Super soft and cute, haven't washed them yet so not sure how they turn up after washing, but so far love them :)",1
"I needed a car seat for my 7 month old.  He was reaching the weight limit for his infant car seat but wasn't old enough to have one that was only a forward facing seat.  This was a godsend and easy to install.  The benefits of having this seat that will stay with him until he is 80 pounds are wonderful.  It is such a safe seat and I feel great having him in it. He feel asleep within the first 20 minutes he was in the seat, a sure sign he likes it.  It is so much easier to put him in the seat too!  Buy it! You won't regret it!",1
I purchased this cover to take to NY city a couple of years ago when my baby boy was little. It not just did the trick but it kept him so warm and cozy in there. It worked great to soundproof the surroundings and the dark cover is a genious idea. It made my trip to NY city much easier with a baby. Great quality. We are about to start using it with our second child this winter in Colorado and I'm sure it will deliver!great buy!,1
"This tub is great for an infant who has outgrown the Kitchen sink tub. My six month old son loved sitting in this and splashing the water, but I noticed the bottom compartment was already deflated.  I thought maybe I didn't close the valve enough (there are two compartments you fill-the sides and also the bottom)The 2nd use is when I saw air bubbles coming from the floor, realizing there was a leak in the tub.  Very disappointing to receive a tub that was defective right away.  But for $14, I guess I couldn't expect much.  I am returning it and hoping another brand will arrive in better condition.Too bad, because other than the leak, I really liked the tub!",0
"One of our favorite diapers along with Gro Via hybrid.  Fits baby well, soft, absorbant, minimal leaks, easy to rinse out solids.  Takes a long time to dry.  Snaps can be difficult.Our daughter is now 2 and this is the only diaper that has held up (at different times we used G Diapers, Bambino Mio and  GroVias), though they are now getting a little worn and we are replacing some.  If we were to start again from scratch I would probably only buy these.",1
I am having to attend a work conference and thought I would purchase this instead of putting my baby in a dirty tub with my foot germs. The concept is good as I can put it in the tub and not expose him to any foot germs and I can then air dry it by removing it. It's easy to inflate and pretty sturdy.,1
"This is probably one of the greatest inventions. Before my baby was born, I purchased this and figured it's a nice-to-have item.I didn't realize until the first day home from the hospital how I would be RELYING on this simple, but necessary timer. When you are sleep deprived and learning everything for the first time, you don't know which way is up or down sometimes. It can be extremely overwhelming, especially when breastfeeding every 2 hours. This timer is a life-saver. It literally never left my side for 3 months.When I forgot it in one room and started feeding my infant, I would desperately call out for someone to bring me my timer! lol.I used it to keep track of how long it's been from the last diaper change, the last nap, and also as a timer for how long my baby nursed on each side. Coupled with the Newborn Baby Tracker - Round the Clock Childcare Journal (which is also a necessity), I never really lost track (or my mind). It's also great for care-takers too, especially when they are picking up for an hour or two when you run out.Please get this for anyone you know who is expecting a baby and they will thank you! One of the most useful items yet.",1
"Be careful with this old model. It only has a THREE point harness. My 7 month old son fell on his head when he leaned over without the tray on. The right strap came undone, the left strap held him suspended for a second, and then he slipped out and fell on his head. We called 911 and went to the emergency room. Tomy has a newer model with a FIVE point harness. They should not be selling these old ones anymore when they know it is an inferior product. I sent Tomy and the CPSC an email about the fall. I will destroy the chair after they contact me. Also note that in 2007, this similar high chair was recalled because the straps came apart from the chair.FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEDecember 6, 2007Release #08-120Firm's Recall Hotline: (866) 725-4407CPSC Recall Hotline: (800) 638-2772CPSC Media Contact: (301) 504-7908RC2 Recalls The First Years(tm) Children's Feeding Seats Due to Fall HazardWASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, in cooperation with the firm named below, today announced a voluntary recall of the following consumer product.

"I love this product! When I decided to do cloth diapering I was hesitant because of the pins. I have never used pins before but when a friend showed these to me, I was sold!",1
Great plates for toddlers. Good portioned size. Dishwasher safe. Glad I got them. Also got the matching spoons and forks.,1
"I just recieved this yesterday and WOW i'm so very impressed.  I have been looking hi and low for bedding that has a high quality quilt, without the high quality price like those specialty websites.  This is gonna be my last baby so i wanted something reasonably priced that looked expensive.  It's so sweet, the butterflies are embroideried into the blanket, the blue ones have a micro fiber fleece thats really soft, and the green ones have a sweater like material.  The pinks on this bedding are so pretty...not that candy cotton pink like all other bedding.  I absolutly love the colors of this bedding....this is my third girl so all pink was out of the question!!! I also ordered the matching valance, and to my suprise once out of the package was very nicely made.  It is lined with a solid white material whcih when hung up allows it to be more opaque...not thin like some others.  All in all this bedding is priced better than other websites carrying the same thing....some have this bedding possted at $200. Trust me you wont be dissapointed!",1
My 5 year old chews on his clothes.  I bought this necklace in an effort to save necklines.  So far he has loved it and I love it too!,1
"I received a fleece one at my baby shower but my son was born the end of April so he could only use it for a few days before we had unseasonably warm weather! After many sleepless nights, I finally got the bright idea to research them in cotton! We used the life out of these, every time he fell asleep, we had to wrap him up if we wanted him to sleep! By 11 weeks, he had slept through the night 3 times! Now that he's outgrown them, we have had to purchase the large ones. The only bummer is that it's much harder to find variety in the large ones!",1
I purchased this for my 2 yr old granddaughter who loves to finger paint. I Love the long sleeves with firm - but not tight- elastic at the end to prevent paint from ending up all over her arms.  The pocket in front is perfect for markers or  paint brushes!,1
"My son prefers these to any other sippy cup spout, so I ordered extras for the cups that he has to replace the hard spouts that came with the Avent sippy cups.  They even fit in the Avent bottle tops, so I was able to ""create"" several more sippy cups out of them.  The other advantages to these spouts is that they don't leak like many others, and they last a long time, even with dishwasher cleaning.",1
"When we were stocking up on cloth diapers, we got snap covers from Thirsties (size 1), Blueberry (one size fits all), and Rumparooz (one size fits all) to use with prefolds. In short, they all achieve their aim of containing baby waste. Here is how the Thirsties cover compares to the others as of now (our son is two months old):Ease of use: all are about the sameFit: the Thirsties offers a trimmer fit than the others, mostly because it is supposed to cover a narrower range of sizes and therefore has less fabricDurability: we haven't had any problems with any of the brands at this pointTime to dry: the Thirsties cover will air dry indoors in a few hours, or overnight at the very most (if the air is really humid); the Blueberry takes slightly longer, and the Rumparooz can take an entire daySo really, I like the Thirsties cover. It works well and looks cute. I would give it five stars if it weren't for this, the reason that I'm writing my review now: it doesn't fit for long, at least for bigger babies. Our guy is, at the age of two months, 14 pounds. We are aready using the largest snap settings, and the elastic leaves red marks on his thighs. Fourteen pounds is a far cry from the advertised maximum weight of 18 pounds. If you have a small, skinny baby, this cover might work just fine, but for larger babies I would recommend opting for some one size fits all diaper covers. They'll last much longer.",1
"Yes, I could swaddle my infant with a regular baby blanket. However, when I was a sleep deprived parent of my newborn son I found this to be one of the greatest conveniences! It was quick and easy to get him swaddled and soothed. He looked so cozy it it. When he woke up in the middle of the night for feedings and needed a diaper change, we could do it without unswaddling his arms so it was easier to soothe him back to sleep. My wife also likes the cute designs so we are definitely getting more of these for our daughter who we are expecting soon!",1
"This product is wonderful! Yes can be a little bit of a pain to open doors even for adults, but it definetly keeps the kids out and that's what it was created for! Glad I bought it and don't have to replace knobs with locks :-)",1
My 5 month old went from an aggravated mess to happily cooing in the car rider line the day installed this activity bar. Great purchase!,1
"The diaper came in quickly and in good shape. It was for a gift, and they were well pleased with it.  Loved the pattern!",1
"I love the shape and how comfy it is but the pillow case or protector that came with it is VERY ITCHY. Not soft like a pillow case, I have to place a regular pillow case where my head is at night.  That's really the only negative to this.",1
My 5 month old baby daughter loves her Sophie!!! It's easy for her to hold and put in her mouth. She is starting to get two teeth and this is definitely her preferred teether.,1
I got this new breastshields after using the size medium which came with the pump. My nipple didn't fit like shown on the instructions. After switching milking became easier and smoother. Would have used XS if it existed.,1
I ordered these for my Playtex pump because  you get a lot for the price. Great quality. I'm going to order the 8 ounce size at a later date.,1
"This is the first baby toy that I have absolutely hated.  Our son hated it, too and we returned it.  First of all, it is really hard to bounce.  Our son is 7 months old and bounces like a ball all over the house and couldn't bounce on this jumper.  Second, getting him in and out of it was a minor feat.  He cried every single time, no matter how gentle we tried to be.  Finally, the way it hangs, he rocks from side to side and spins around in circles.  He loved the spinning to a point, then it got him really upset because he couldn't control it.We returned it and bought a Graco and he loves it.",0
"This is a gorgeous crib. No doubt. I received it in A-1 condition.But, I do not understand the comments that I've read how it's so easy to put together. It's an absolutely HORRIBLE design. And it takes forever to assemble!!The 'long' screws were not long enough. After an hour of trying to jam the screw in to make contact I gave up. I got my own screwsand it worked fine. Plus the way it's designed, the 'thread' you put into the whole for the screw to catch is constantly turning so you can never easily screw the lousy screw in.  I used my own screws and threw the others away.  Plus the sides aren't labeled A B or C, etc. So the directions say to connect side A to side...  Where's A? It's not labeled!  You're guessing.  And if you guess wrong and those defective screws tie you up you'll end up throwing the thing out the window.  I finally got it together and it looks great. But, don't let those comments, 'My husband put it together in 20 minutes! YAY!' sway you.  You'll be cursing for at least 20 minutes.Maybe I received defective screws or a lazy factory worker put in the wrong hardware.  But, it was nothing less than a nightmare!",0
"It took me an hour to put this product together.  After it was all put together, it felt and looked flimsy.  I affixed it to my 15 month's old twin bed and he managed to push the rail down and take it apart in one night.It doesn't fit flushly with the mattress and I couldn't figure out how to make it bed to tuck it between his mattress.  I threw it away.  Very disappointed in the product.  I hardly write reviews, but I had to write about how cheaply made this product was.",0
"This is not the actual 9 piece set you would find in the store, but an 8 piece set with an &#34;extra sheet.&#34; Everything looks great but the extra sheet, as it is a different color than what comes with the 9 piece set and is a different brand (Carters).Baby SuperMall is dishonest with their listing titles (&#34;8 piece set + carters crib sheet&#34; would be more appropriate). I would not recommend them, or at least read everything within the listing to ensure you know what your getting.",0
Crib Toy a nice beautiful product for the new one in the family or simply as a gift for someone with a newborn.,1
I am very glad with this purchase.  Paid less than $50 so this is a great deal.  Cannot vouch for the coverage distance but I have no interference or signal-dropping problems as I have only used this indoor.  The rechargeable stand and the small size are great features.,1
"I bought this toy/projector for my grandson who was born in September of 2012...I RAVED about Vtech to my daughter, telling her all about how I SWORE by their products for my kids(her included obviously lol) when they were little, and that I really liked the educational value, and the durability of the Vtech toys, and it made it more than worth the money to buy Vtech...I felt like a fool a short time later when this toy didn't even last 3 months! It was ONLY used at the babys' nap time, and by a newborn, so it's not as if it was being handled roughly or misused, in any way...it just stopped working...tried to change batteries, of course, and that wasn't the problem...the music still plays, but the images do not project at ALL...overall very disappointed in this item! It was NOT worth the money, and my RAVE reviews for Vtech are over with for sure!",0
"One of the two cameras that came with this just died and I'm really hoping the other one doesn't follow suit! I went an entire weekend with only 1 camera working as Motorola is closed. They have online chat that says they are available every day but when I tried to contact them in a chat, nobody ever joined from Motorola.  I am calling them tomorrow to see what they are going to do for me since my baby isn't even 5 months yet and this failed! I am very disappointed, I put my trust in this company.  Let's hope they do right by me!",0
I tried to use this while pregnant but for me it was too thick and firm.  However it did make a great tool for propping up our newborn's mattress because he needs to sleep elevated due to reflux.,0
"The other reviewers are right. This is the first time I ordered a baby product in a hurry and didn't read the reviews.The material is a cute pattern...that is the only nice thing I can say. I have a big baby (8.5 lbs at birth, by 2 months she was in the 86th and 60th percentiles for height and weight) and it was way too big for her at 3 and 4 months old. Most pediatricians recommend swaddling only for the first few months, so when exactly is she supposed to wear this?No matter how I swaddled, hands by sides or hands by face, she got out of this because the velcro ""swaddle"" piece is just too big.I thought maybe I could use this as JUST a sleep sack since it is so adorable, but the swaddle piece does not detach.Basically this was a worthless purchase and it was immediately thrown into our yard sale. No point in keeping it for our next baby. Don't waste your time.",0
"I agree with the other moms that these are a little small, but if your newborn doesn't drink a whole four ounces at a time, it is great to be able to thaw only two ounces at a time. The good thing about these is that you can pump directly into them and freeze them. There is no need to transfer to a storage baggie thing and there is little or no chance that they will leak. When I was considering what to get, I kept reading about moms who pumped milk and then kept it in storage bags only to have it leak when thawed. Given the amount of time it takes to pump milk, to loose it to leaking bags is terrible. I only bought 12 of these and that was plenty - I am not a full-time working mom, so it was only to use sometimes when I was at school or working a few days in a row. If you work full time, you may want to buy two sets or even bigger ones. It is annoying to have to switch bottles several times while pumping.",1
"My baby is 3.5 months old and would rather sit then lay down. He's very big for his age and we opted for this seat over the Bumbo after reading many reviews that the Bumbo is too small.  I'm so glad we did! We have had this about 2 weeks and he loves it!  It took him no time to figure out the toys even though he can't rotate it yet - I do it for him.  I also attached some of his favorite toys that have the plastic clips - there's plenty of extra space on the tray.  My only complaint is that we are using the orange infant seat and it sits back a little too far so I put a blanket behind him to hold his back straight.  It has helped his head control since he doesn't like being on the floor.  I can see that we will get lots of use from this as a chair to have him at dinner with us, feeding, and traveling to grandparents.  It is a little pricy but it's worth it, especially if you haven't already bought a highchair, you really won't need one.",1
i had originally gotten this in red from toysrus but needed an extra one since we have another family car now. i ordered through amazon because they always have the best prices and found this color and totally fell in love with it! my son loves it as well. its more masculine and can match any interior car! love this booster seat! i have also recommended it to a few friends and will continue to recommend it!!,1
This little pillow is just the right size and super soft and comfy for your little one or for travel. Much nicer than the standard travel pillows they sell in the store. Bought for my 2 year old's first pillow.,1
"Pretty good, overall. Large deep wells for food and sturdy.  I have never had any leakage, but I am very deliberate when putting the lid on. Bought 2 sets so that 1 can go to daycare for lunch and the other has dinner ready for us when we get home from work/daycare.",1
"I bought this product for my grand-baby who is 5 months of age. She loves jumping in this jumperoo and she also loves the little toys.  She will jump and jump until she jumps herself to sleep. If I try to remove her from the jumperoo once she has fallen asleep, she will awaken and begin to jump again.  She makes a lot of noise while jumping and smiles a lot.  She will even scream out. Out of all the different toys I have for her to entertain herself with, she seems to love this product the best.  It is a good way to keep baby occupied while you attend to cooking, cleaning or any chore you may have to do. You can rest assure that baby is safe in this item.  I always keep my grand-baby in sight while she is in this item because it is best to be safe than sorry.",1
"The picture is a bit misleading in the sense that:1- the logo &#34;Tykelight Wallmate&#34; is printed on the &#34;belly&#34; of the animal. It actually looks like a promotional product for the company...however I used some nail polish remover and it took it right off!2- there is no pretty pink color as in the picture- it's green, blue or red (it's an LED light) or changes colors.It works well otherwise and serves its purpose in my baby's room; not too bright but just enough light when I need to pick him up without turning the lights on.",1
"This seems to be the only cup our daughter will take milk out of. It is prone to leaking when using the handles. However it is fine without the handles. It comes with both a sippy top and a bottle nipple top. With the bottle nipple top, my daughter constantly sucks so hard that the nipple pops loose. She's learning to release the vacuum.",1
My son's first rattle was his first bff!!! He chewed the ears so much I had to wash this rattle every day. Its cute and wont hurt baby.  I recommend soft rattles for babies because with the hard ones baby can hit himself very hard,1
"I have had this stroller for about a year and a half. Previously, I had a Chicco Cortina stroller and loved that (also great for talls-- I'm 6 feet) but it was so heavy it became impractical. I love the Heavenly Stroller because it's the only umbrella-type stroller tall enough for me. It folds easily and is very light. I live in New York City and use the stroller for my daughter (now 3) constantly since we don't have a car. My daughter is tall and she seems perfectly comfortable in it.But a few weeks ago, as we were returning home from the park, one of the handles snapped off at the joint. It was unfixable and I was bummed. I wasn't about to buy a new stroller but it was pretty unusable with only one handle (and that one feeling really wobbly). So I emailed the company and they found and sent me two replacement handles. We are rolling again.I think our handles wore out because we use the stroller multiple times a day for long and short distances up and down stairs, maneuvering around the city, on trains, shopping, etc. Our stroller gets very heavy wear and tear. Everything else has held up-- the wheels, the brakes, the little pouch. No problems. But I must say I'm most impressed with the customer service. It wasn't immediate, but it was great. I highly recommend the stroller.",1
"We needed to keep our puppy in the kitchen sometimes, and having this gate that we could still pass through easily solved the problem for us.  When we don't need it any more, it will just easily be removed!",1
"Love, Love, Love this bra! Being able to tandem pump and do something else at the time was great! I was able to express and bottle one of my twins at the same time or read a book. So nice to not feel like it was ""wasted"" time. (I am not one to like being idle for long.) Or to be quickly though expressing in the middle of the night because I could tandem express and not have to worry about falling asleep holding the pump kits on. Very helpful! Also very comfortable to wear, easy to adjust and wash. Holds pump kits securely.",1
"They didn't taste bad, but they aren't in the least big sour. Didn't work for me at all. Very disappointed, just glad they didn't cost much.",0
"Our daughter is only two, but she is very tall for her age and quickly outgrew her traditional car seat.  We wanted a combination booster seat that would grow with her and be comfortable for her.  This seat is it.  She has never wanted to use the neck pillow that is included with the set - it pushes her head too far forward.  But otherwise, this seat is excellent.  It easily moves from car to car, is comfortable for her, and is easy for her to get into and out of.  She loves being able to pull out and push in the cup holders for her juice.  The armrests and headrest are adjustable, and the entire back removes so that she can just use the bottom booster seat when she is ready.  This seat will grow with her as she grows.  It has been a great investment!!As an update, she's still using the seat, althoug we've outgrown the back, and it's still going strong.  It's held up great to several spills and washes, and is still comfortable for her.",1
"We're expecting twins and need car seats for them.  We used a Graco SnugRide with my son 4 years ago but 1. that was before the redesign that lets them hold a little bigger baby and 2. the padding in his was THIN and 3. a cat got in our garage and peed on his so I don't want to use it again EVER (except maybe to hurl at that cat).My biggest concern with the SnugRide was that my son's was so hard - he hated being in the car seat as an infant.  I briefly considered getting something ""fancier"" (such as the Chicco Keyfit) thinking it might be more comfortable for baby OR getting the Graco SafeSeat 1 since it can be used longer.  However, the fancier seats cost more and the SnugRide has always come out on top for safety - even with the recent bizarre recalled safety test, Graco won.  So I set about finding a SnugRide that was comfy - and not ugly!  (There are some remarkably hideous SnugRides out there!!!)A tip - the Graco seats that come with the travel systems *seem* to be more cheaply made, thin padding, etc.  If you want a nice one, you may have to buy alone - not an issue for us since Graco doesn't sell a double travel system anyway that I can tell.  Look for the Gracos with the ""gracopedic"" foam.  Some of the SafeSeats have them, some of the SnugRides have them.  It's GOOD stuff.The cover on this seat is flashy, but neutral.  I mean, you can use it for a girl or a boy.  We are having two little girls and hope to have one more child - this could be re-used either way.The fabric is nylony - kind of smooth, slippery, not scratchy.  *Maybe* not as nice as cotton but my thinking is little spills will wipe off easily.Two cons - sunshades have to be assembled yourself and it's a little tricky, and I don't know that the ""boot"" will proove that useful.  But all around this is a safer, comfier, and cheaper seat than the flashier brands - even if it is pricey for a SnugRide.  Worth the extra money.We decided ultimately to skip the SafeSeat since, even though the longer range of use is nice, realistically we are not going to want to be hauling two babies in buckets once they get that big.  The seat itself is bigger and just seems more akward over all.  Maybe a good consideration, though, for only one baby.SnugRide in Lotus seems the way to go, to me.  Search around - I was able to get this seat for thirty bucks less than here.  ;-)",1
My son prefers the full-sized muslin blankets to these. They aren't bad but I've noticed a little fraying/pilling to the materials after several washes.,1
"Great products, just as pictured and delivered on time! I have ordered an additional set of cups through this vendor.",1
"I purchased this gate to keep my 9 week old lab puppy out of the kitchen and it works perfectly.  I really only needed the length and not the height but I couldn't find a shorter gate to fit a 48"" opening.  I'm a little over 5 feet and I have slight difficulty getting over it, you kind of have to straddle it at the top and swing the other leg over -  but I don't intend to use it forever.  If you are looking for a permanent gate, just spend the money and get one with a door.  But, if you only need something for training this will work.",1
"After washing a gazillion bottles, I was given the playtex drop-in system as a gift. Wow, what a time saver! I LOVED not having to wash the whole bottle every few hours. I did feel a little guilty about the waste, but I eased my mind by putting the liners in the recycling bin. I loved the 4 oz because in the beginning, my baby ate at most 4 oz and so it was less waste.",1
"For the first 2 months of her life, our little one slept in a rocking sleeping right next to our bed and we didn't really have use for a monitor. When we moved out of our apartment, we set up a room for baby that was on the opposite side of the house from our room, and a monitor was suddenly a must-have. So we took a whole weekend to read hundreds of reviews for baby monitors and finally settled on this one. We were nervous because the ""out of range"" beeping was one of the biggest cons that people listed in their reviews, and I didn't know what we would do if incessant beeping forced us to turn off the monitor in the middle of the night. Well, it took us a few nights to find a good frequency, and the perfect location for the monitor and its receiver, but once we discovered what worked, we've been good to go ever since. For some reason, it will occasionally beep ""out of range"" when someone walks past her bedroom, but very rarely and only for a few seconds. None of this monitor's little quirks are annoying enough to overcome the fact that it is a great monitor. We leave it on the voice activated setting when we go to bed at night, and it will pick up the slightest sound she makes. The clarity is incredible - this is a great monitor for the price, and I recommend you give it a try.",1
"I can't say enough good things about this chair!!  We love it!  It is really easy to use on a wide range of tables.  We mainly use it at our bar, but it fits well on all of the tables we've tried it on so far.  It is a great thing to have for going to dinner with friends or family.  It also comes in handy when having company with a small child as one can use this and the other can use the high chair.  Folds up easily to travel.The tray is a bit tough to get on and off, but that is probably good so that the child can't pinch their fingers.I do have one complaint and that is regarding the strap. It is the kind that has one center piece and the two side straps snap into the center.  It holds the child in securely, but doesn't always come unsnapped on one side very easily.  I also have a Graco swing with the same snap &amp; have had the same problem.  This can be a bit frustrating, but is definitely not enough to keep me from highly recommending this item!",1
"I liked it at the outset. We bought it (and another) when my youngest was 2 months old.Problems:The velcro gets very wonky pretty much right away when you wash it (but to be expected, rally).As you use it frequently the parts that tuck the arms around being taxed and soon I'm finding little hands poking through the bottomFor the last two months the zipper has been sticking. The part that sticks up that you pull down keeps getting caught at a strange angle that makes it impossible to pull down until its fixed. Trying to manage that with a wiggly or upset baby is difficult.On another HALO sack that I have, the zipper is outright coming undone from the fabric.The zipper part on this one in particular is now ruined. It can't unzip all the way. We still attempt to use it, but I am disappointed these things fell apart and my baby is only 8 months old.We did nothing crazy with these. Washed them according to instruction, used them as laid out.Things I like:It is very easy to use. Zip baby up, fold arms over and velcro.Good for babies who don't like to be overswaddled as there are several swaddling optionsAvailable in different fabrics. This one worked well in both spring and summer.",0
"These were so easy to slip on around our daughter's car seat straps.  Our car seat didn't come with strap covers, and she kept getting red marks on her neck so this product worked perfect!  The baby has yet to pull them off too.",1
"It developed a lot of pilling on the fabric. It's not bad, though, overall. I'll consider getting another for my next child.",0
"I bought these parts for my wife for her Playtex Embrace breast pump.  Not that I mind buying replacement parts for a constantly used item, but we were buying new parts for these pumps every month, and that really added up.  We ended up sending the pump back to Playtex and bought a Medela Pump in Style instead and haven't had to replace a single thing on it.",0
my 6 1/2 month old was teething in earnest and he would chew on everything (including my chin)!  Bought this teether and he went to town.  Love that it comes with a case. Would recommend this teether to anyone,1
"I bought this product as a small gift for a friend's newborn. She lives far away. We didn't want to send any clothes that wouldn't fit and many toys we looked at were not for the newborn. She loved, loved the gift! Her husband, who's in charge of burping the baby boy, said the burp cloths were very useful. I'd recommend this product for someone who's not looking to spend a ton of money, yet wants to give a nice and useful gift.",1
"Sure, you can thread the seatbelt through the actual carseat...but what a pain!  After my husband struggled to belt my son into his car while he was crying and uncomfortable we invested in an extra base.  Now he can have the baby in the car and they are on their way before my son has a chance to get annoyed!  The 10 minutes a day this saves my husband and son from being uncomfortable is well worth the price.  Also, we both have peace of mind knowing the base is properly installed and my son is as safe as can be.",1
"It's a fun toy. My baby girl loves it. It is easy to put on the car seat, stroller or crib.",1
"Love this playmat! Bought it when my son was 9 months old, and he is now 15 months old and still loves crawling around and playing on it and taking the letters out. It slides around very well on wood floors if you want to move it. Also, you can only use half or 3/4 of the mat if you don't want the full mat. You can arrange it however you want. Definitely recommend!",1
"I use this as an overnight diaper. Daily use ok but for small size, it bunches up in the middle & my little one has a hard time moving around because prefold so thick. No leaks yet. I use the shell with disposable biodegradable liners when out of the house. Works well.",1
So happy with this purchase! It is so cute with the boon grass rack and helps to hold those small bottle accessories.,1
"From the genius metal feet, backpack straps and mommy pocket to the crumb hole allowing ickies to escape without frustration to the fact that it's machine washable, I love this bag.  I appreciate quality and value for my money.  Considering I will be carrying this bag for the next 18 months minimum I am delighted with its versatility and convenience.  The many pockets are perfect for putting away things like soothers, robeez, nursing pads, diaper ointment, and anything else you want tucked away but easy to find.There are a couple of small things like, I do find that when it's fully loaded it can start to tip forward but with a moment taken to repack it's taken care of.  That only happens when it is really, really full. And I do stuff it full.  I can carry a wet/dry bag, diapers, wipes, baby carry wrap, extra outfit, sleeper, blanket, and too many other little things to think of off the top of my head.The colors are vibrant and gorgeous.  The change pad is nice and soft. I would like it if it had wings to the sides. With the backpack straps on the bag it isn't as simple to get the change pad in and out as when those straps are off, but it's a small price to pay.  The non-slip portion of the shoulder strap means it really does stay on my shoulder, vs. the OiOi bag that wouldn't stay on for even five minutes.If you're not certain, go check this bag out in person. I wasn't convinced all the hoopla was worth it until I saw it in person, packed it in the store with a bunch of stuff to see how it would do and decided I liked it.  Now that I own it and have been using it I am so glad I bought it. I love it.",1
"Like many parents to be we found ourselves looking for reasonably priced nursery furniture and this seemed to fit the bill; multi use drawers and changing top, ample storage, clean design, and reasonably priced.It showed up in a big box, pretty well packaged on the outside with crush bumpers on each corner and running along the lengths of the box. So far so good right? Apparently they must have spent all their packaging budget on the outside of the box to prevent damage and very little on the inside, there's damage to a few of the pieces including the main top board corner. Although there were a ton of crush bumpers and corner braces they still neglected to adequately protect the pieces inside. Contrast this to the crib I just assembled last night that had the main pieces wrapped in sheets of foam and therefore didn't need the multitude of bumpers and braces. Sometimes spending more to package it right inside the box makes more sense than making the outside bulletproof.On to assembly, I've assembled many cheap particle board based furniture in my day so I regretfully dismissed the reviews here about assembly difficulty. I grew up on K-mar and Ikea furniture assembly, how bad could this be? Apparently I've fallen off my high horse, the assembly design of this thing makes Ikea assembly look like genius design, a beacon of pictorial assembly art, and a shining example of using as few as possible different bolt/screws combinations. This literally came with a big bag of bolts. Do yourself a favor and download the assembly PDF from the manufacturer's website: [...]. Now take a look at the assembly hardware list. Confused yet? I resorted to counting the specific screws to make sure I was using the right one at times, in fact I probably spent more time making sure I was using the right screw than I did actual assembly, it was a game of logic to figure out which screw is which # on the part sheet and some were packed in the wrong pouch.And about the hardware, drawer rails were completely plastic, even the dowels to connect pieces were plastic. I guess the design was tested to make do with plastic but the cost cutting is apparent and noticeable. The drawer rails are completely made out of plastic which seemed odd to me for such a crucial part, they are also hammered into the panels and use no hardware whatsoever. Not sure how much they saved with this design but doesn't give me much confidence that it's built to last. The design has also been changed and instead of updating the assembly instructions they chose to add a separate insert to call out that parts xyz are deemed no longer necessary and to ignore in assembly, this tells me the company is focused on saving cost of updating printed manuals vs. the customer experience. There are also pre-drilled holes that are not used and add to assembly confusion. Again a sign of ""we changed our mind but we'll let the customer figure it out"". Onto the pictorial assembly, download the PDF so you can zoom in and see the parts and orientation much more clearly than the provided print copy. Instead of laying out the pieces and coming back to them in the same perspective, they'll abruptly change direction (flip the picture) on you and made me question if I had it right. The logic of the assembly is also suspect, it stops assembly of the frame mid way to focus on the drawers which in turn draws out the time where you would have parts just strewn about the room. It's an odd choice and something I fell into since I was following directions.On the bright side, the company is readily wiling to send me replacement and assembly parts free of charge. Awesome right? A manufacturer that stands behind their product but.....it could take up to 10 days to get your part. So here I am now with a 50"" by 42"" box siting face down on in the nursery with assorted parts still laying around that's making it harder for me to work on other parts of the room now. Lesson here is that yes you can get parts easily but plan on plenty of room to assemble and be prepared to wait if you're missing hardware and/or replacement parts.We will keep the piece now that I'm already 80% complete but I would reconsider given how much time it's taken to get assembly this far (4-5 hours already). If I paid myself $20/hr to save the headaches and for an easier to assemble and higher quality piece I could have bumped up the budget to a different price point and gone with something else.It's not a terrible piece of furniture but be forewarned what you're in for.EDIT: It's been 8 days now and I'm still waiting for replacement parts to arrive and the latest shipping update shows I have another 4 days to wait. Mind you, this shipping to PA, if you're further from Canada it could be longer still. I've had a 80% finished dresser hanging around the nursery over a week now and by the time the parts show up it will be close to 2 weeks since I even started to put this thing together. In retrospect, this is not a delay I need in getting the nursery ready. Be warned and account up to 2 weeks after receipt.....",0
"Yes, this is mesh, yes, they don't make light weight cotton sleepsacks at this stage which is too bad. But for what it is, it's perfect.Things to Know:The other reviewers aren't kidding when they say this thing is BIG. Unlike all the other night time clothing you're used to getting, this runs true to size if not a little bit larger. If your child is not both in the correct weight and height category for this item, order a size down.Happily, if you do what I did and not listen to this good advice, the Amazon return policy is wonderful and incredibly easy.Also, here's a tip if it's borderline too big for your child - use socks on the outside of the sleepsack to hold the little leg openings in place. If there's a bunch of loose fabric hanging between the legs you're kind of out of luck but if your main issue is the feet slipping back into the sleepsack - use socks.",1
This crib skirt is different from others because of the way it is pleated. It is a perfect addition to my wonder bumpers! I could not be happier with my bumpers and crib skirt! These are quality products that I would highly recommend.,1
"I loved the idea, and he will use them for coaxing, but they are a little TOO THICK to chew on. If they were a  bit thinner, he would absolutely love them! They are a good substitute for fingers, but simply too thick for a baby under 6 months to chew on as a favorite.He likes to play with them, and now that he is older and teething, he likes them. He is one year now, and has used them when they were given to him when he was 9 months.Absolutely excellent quality. Arrives nicely packaged. Lovely gift for teething baby.",1
"My 15 month old daughter has absolutely no interest in this toy. We bought this for her when she was around 6 months old or so and she has never played with it. It doesn't do anything. I think there is one spot that will play a little bit of music when you squeeze it, but that's about it. Save your money.",0
"These are so great for daycare, where there a too many cups for the providers to be able to keep straight whose is whose, or when kids bring in identical cups...",1
My granddaughter loves the Lulu Ladybug Rocker!  She is 11 months old and is able to rock herself.  She loves the abc song that play while she rocks.  A great buy!,1
"We own two of the car seats and are very pleased with them. We have one child who is a long and very lithe toddler (forward facing), and one who is a chunky baby (rear facing, reclined). The seat works perfectly for both of them. It is easy to install, easy to buckle, and comfortable for both children. Grandparents like these seats so much, they bought two for their own car to transport the kids!",1
"This is great for the first 30-60 days with a new baby, but good for the garbage after that.  It gets moldy fast, and a larger baby will flip right out.  I would say it's likely there is something better, but for the price it's good.",0
"Picked this up as an impulse buy at Target while shopping with my 22 month old who is starting to try out the potty.  He is becoming more and more interested in Cars, so we opted to make a big deal about it and bring it home.  Had I researched this a little, I would have never headed down the potty aisle in Target...He loves it...used it right away and loves the shift knob noises.  If I ask him if he wants to go potty in Lighting, the answer is almost always yes.  This is the only reason I am giving it 2 stars - it does appeal to little ones.Cleanup is less than desirable (-5 stars if I could).  He must be lined up and 'tucked' just right, which can be hard to do with a squirmy one.  If not, the seat, cushion, bowl and floor beneath will be covered.  We also have theFisher-Price Precious Planet Froggy Friend Pottythat my daughter picked out when she was training.  It was very easy cleanup because it is one piece, but harder for my little guy to straddle and sit on.Bottom line?  I would take it back in a heartbeat IF he didn't love using it so much.  Like another review said, if it helps speed the potty training process along, I will keep the cleaners handy and go with it.REVISED 7/1:  Couldn't take it anymore and had to take it back.  Was cleaning up more off the floor than I was on the actual seat.  Dropping it to one star.",0
"Cute pattern, but very bulky and awkward to zip up.  Was excited for this to arrive, but after seeing it in person I quickly returned it.  This blanket would be a total pain in the rear to put back together, especially if I'm along with my toddler.",0
"I'm really happy with this purchase.  I work in an office where I can't lug around a diaper bag every day, so I needed to find a larger black purse that I could fit a few baby items in for when I pick up the baby.  Although a purse doesn't have the pockets and bottle holders that make life easier (no insulated bottle holders though).  And I do wish there was one external pocket on the side to fit a bottle or sippy cup.  I'm always nervous having a drink inside my ""purse"" that can leak.I was expecting the bag to come with stroller clips and a wristlet for mom as mentioned on other websites, but this one only came with a very small changing pad. Since I'm only reviewing the diaper bag itself, I'm still giving it 5 stars. It's great quality too!",1
Easy to put together. Meets my needs as it serves as a seating bench in addition to storing away toys,1
"Not ideal to load all the time, for that you need the backpack with wheels. I try to have the entire collection because my daughter loves animals, especially owls",1
"I didn't want a mesh feeder because of cleaning issues, plus who wants to chew on mesh?  These feeders are great - easy to throw in whatever food you want to give baby and you don't have to worry about choking.  They are great for out and about since they cause less mess too.  I recommend them to all my friends.  The small size is fairly small so good for younger babies - can fit a few blueberries in.  The larger size is just wider, probably a little bigger than a quarter.",1
"I purchased this play yard for my new grand daughter to use when she comes to my home. It is well constructed, sturdy and attractive. I love that it has a bassinet which can be removed when she is grown enough to use the play yard and the changing table has a storage area for diapers and other necessary items. I am surprised at the bargain price!Safety 1st Travel Ease Elite Play Yard, Orion",1
"The seat is fine, however it didn't fit our bicycle frame....but with a little creativity and a trip to HD we got it to work. So make sure it fits ur bicycle frame before buying it. Other than that, it's a good seat.",0
This product does exactly what it is designed to do: it prevents vulnerable body parts from connecting with sharp corners. I like the product a lot.,1
"I had this as a child and remember liking it.  I bought it for my child though and didn't anymore much.  It is really hard to open.  When I pull the sides apart, I have to shake it all around to get the shapes to fall out.  I know my little ones could never do this.  I also don't really like the ball design because it is hard to find the correct hole.  This toy is durable and nicely bright colored, but I prefer other shape toys.",0
My wife loves it and is so much more comfortable in bed with this item.  Plus I like using it when she is not!,1
We love Seventh Generation wipes and diapers. For the most part we use cloth wipes and diapers during the day and disposables at night. We have tried several other brands but Seventh Generation is the best!  We use many of their products in our home.,1
"I was very excited to receive this monitor and when we got done with the charging for 18hrs and got ready to use it, it was horrible we could not see any picture all we got out of it was sound. Save you Money!",0
This is a very nice cooler very well insulated and the cooling packs included aren't cheap like most and they have seperate pockets that they are placed in. It also has a pacifier holder. Very happy with this purchase.,1
I have a 3 month old son and he loves this. The colors are fun and grab his attention. I was not sure what to expect of the material quality and it's very silky and soft. It was easy to assemble. I was a little overwhelmed with all the different activity gyms to choose from but this product had great reviews and was much more affordable compared to the $80+ cost of similar products. I couldn't be more satisfied.,1
I use it inside the house to store my 6 month old grandsons little toys. Once he's older I will attach it to his stroller. Very convenient!,1
"I tried the diaper champ at a friends house and HATED it, the diapers kept getting stuck in the flipping thingy. So, when it was time for me to get a diaper pail I chose the Genie. Honestly, it is very easy to use and it does control oder. However, my biggest problem with this is the first few diapers I put in always come untwisted. It really bothers me, I have to keep cutting and retying the bag. The only way I have found to reslove this is to make sure the first three or four diapers are very light and then to twist the Genie four or five times. Other then that it has done everything it is promised to do. Despite the problem I have with mine I would still buy it all over again if I had to.",1
"I love this tub, my baby loves this tub. But sadly, we are on a second one and already it has a hole in it. The first one formed a hole in a seam on one end after about 3 months. The replacement tub (free, via Amazon - great customer service!) formed a hole within 3 weeks. We are using it as designed, with a now 10-month old baby. Really bummed, as the tub is PERFECT otherwise! At least you can count on Amazon to come through if it develops a hole like ours did.",0
"We bought the big dot waterproof pad and a spare for bed accidents.  Our oldest leaks through his diapers at night and we wanted some extra protection so we didn't have to change sheets so often.  Also, he is potty training and isn't wearing diapers for his naps.  This product works great for smaller leaks however when there is a large amount of pee it went through to his sheets and mattress pad.  Cute product but they could improve the function.",0
"I gave the kick mat's a 5star rating, because they are amazing, I have grandkids in car seats that would  kick the seats and leave a lot of scuff marks, but no more.  With the purchase of the kick mat's the back of my seats will be clean. I love how easy they were to put on seat and loved that I received 2in the pkg.  there was even a little thank you card for purchasing from Freddie&Sebbie; via Amazon.I would recommend highly!",1
"Ordered two sets of these and use them all the time.  I've been using them for a year now, and they are still good as new.",1
An adorable turtle that lights up and plays classical music. My six month old granddaughter loves this toy she received for Christmas.,1
Clay didn't come out as smooth as other ones I've bought for my other kids. I loved the idea of a handprint AND a footprint but if I have any more I'd probably do a different one.,0
"Setting up the stroller was pretty straight forward, just follow the instrucitons in the booklet and it was all done in about 10 minutes. The stroller is reasonably compact when folded and would have to problem fitting into the boot of any mid-sized sedans.Quality wise, everything looks of reasonable quality, did not notice any parts that looks cheap or flimsy. However, I do hope that the latch that you pull to close and open the stroller is built to last. So far, it looks strong but that strap is going to have to withstand countless pulls and it is also the 'handle' which you hold on to when u carry the folded stroller around. Please note that you shouldn't be carrying the stroller using the child tray (this is stated in the user manual). The child tray is easily removable and able to pivot on either side for easy handling of baby.Manouvering the stroller is a breeze and the wheels are very smooth. Folding is pretty easy, just pull the strap, but you will have to give an extra push once is folded to make it as flat as possible. Unfolding will need both hands and some practicing but is pretty straightforward.The hood is huge as it is expandable to cover about 90% of the &#34;passenger&#34;. There is also a peekaboo window but I wonder why Graco did not add a velcro to hold the peekaboo flap in place, although it stay pretty much stays in place already, but not sure when it is outdoors and the wind gets strong, the flaps may start flapping around.The height of the stroller is good, I am 1.88 meters tall (6ft 1in) and I no problems pushing the stroller around, no need to bend over.Overall I am please with the stroller, although the final call would have to be my newborn due only in June. So we shall see.",1
I loved the bedding it was prefect for what my daughter was looking for since she doesn't like too much pink. It has more yellow.,1
"This was brought for a shower gift.  I love the color, and its softness.  It looks really well made,  My niece was so pleased with her bouncer...",1
My friend recommended this toy saying that it's her son's favorite so I started searching for it. BRU/TRU used to have it online but not any more. I called my local TRU and was told it would be in stock soon. TRU sells it for $[...] or something. I'm surprised to see it's sold so expensive here. Is it different from the model sold at TRU?,1
"These are great. I thought they might be cheap but they are a wonderful quality. Just like the kind you get at a local baby franchise store. Buy two. You can't have enough of these lying around. Older kidos can use them too. My nieces and nephew grab them for their baths when they come visit. Ages 7, 5, and 20 months.",1
I like the carry all bag and cooler.  It makes it nice to take to work and the bag is generic enough that it is discrete.,1
Good quality but all of the circles/rings come apart and then it doesn't work very well as a playmat. I returned it for another Tadpoles playmat that only has one large circle in the center of each square. Works great for my 8-month-old!,0
"My poor husband nearly had a melt-down trying to install this gate because the instructions were only pictures and had no written words. This drove him crazy because he had no clue what was happening in the pictures. I was able to step in and sort of guide him through the process and we were able to successfully install the gate together.Unfortunately, our wall is damaged as the sticky pads that come with the gate are super sticky and if you place the bracket (with sticky pad attached) in the wrong place, expect a nice chunk of paint to be missing.Also, the gate was unwieldy during installation as it would swing back and forth. It would be nice if they had it zip-tied so that you could handle the gate without the gate swinging all over the place. This was a large contributor to my husband&#8217;s frustration. We ended up tying the gate shut while we lifted it and moved it around.Once it was installed, we like it. The gate looks nice and modern in our home. The opening and closing mechanism is easy to use. It seems sturdy and able to withstand our daughter leaning on it.It was shipped and arrived quickly.",0
"1. Swaddling is good: it allows your baby to relax and feel secure as if he/she was in his mother's womb. they cry less, sleep more and everyone is happier2. Swaddling with sheets doesn't last long: a couple of movements and the baby has opened it and a couple of minutes later he's fussy and crying.3. SwaddleMe solve the issue, they're secure and allow you to change the baby while keeping the arms swaddled: very helpful because babies don't like being changed and will get fussy and wave their arms erratically and make your job really hard.Conclusion: highly recommended",1
"This is our second purchase of this same crib.  With another little one on the way and our first-born not ready for a bed yet, we got another crib.  It is so easy to put together (everything is nicely labeled).  And it's an easy product to clean.  It holds up well and is a nice design.  Plus very safe which is of utmost importance.",1
"This is an older version of the Jessica bag.  It is not the one currently in production from Bumble Bags.  I purchased it, then returned it after receiving the package.  There is only one magnetic snap to close the entire bag.  It does not have the internal zipper, stroller straps, back zipper pocket or bottle holder pockets that are available on the updated models.  Don't waste your money on this!",0
"These are great bath toys.  My son especially loves the cups.  The fish stick to the wall very well (unlike the mainstream version we were given and have since donated). With the fish on the wall and the cups stacked up, the toys take up almost no bath space and we don't have to worry about storage.  I highly recommend this product!",1
"We have two large and one small dog, and were worried that a stand-alone high chair might get knocked about.  This seat is portable, easy to clean, and never in danger of being tipped over.  It straps to the chair and still slides under the table.  We store the tray in between the seat back and the chair.  We do not use the white tray or the green lid.Our daughter is now 8 months old, and knows that the chair means FOOD,  It's nice that we can bring it places and she will still know what is going on, because it's familiar to her.Be careful about the little fingers getting pinched though!  We had two pinching incidents, but now our daughter has learned that when we put down the tray and say &#34;Hands up,&#34; she gets her arms out of the way.",1
This fits the Britax B-Agile perfectly. It does cover the pull strap for folding but it is easily accessible through the hole the crotch strap comes through.The liner does move around a bit and needs to be repositioned but it takes just a second to tug back into place and is way easier than spot cleaning my stroller.It washes well and didn't shrink. I put it in the dryer for 10 minutes and then let it air dry the rest of the way.I don't recommend it for the Britax B-Ready. The B-Ready has a narrow seat and this liner is too wide for it.,1
"I love the durability of this bag and the materials used.  I love that each of the bags in this series has something unique about them.  Either it be the material, the zipper tag, or ear material.  For the Zebra, the orange nose is a corduroy material which adds a really nice touch to it.  It fits a lunch sized sandwich container and other smaller items easily in here.  And the nametag on the inside is also really nice to have.I highly recommend this product, and will be purchasing another for my other child when he gets older.  I just need to decide which animal to get him.",1
"After purchasing and returning SEVERAL top of stairs gates, we finally found one that works with our double banister configuration WITHOUT having to drill into the wood.  I'm giving it only 4 stars because it does shift during normal use, just enough so that it becomes misaligned and both the top and bottom pegs won't go in easily at times.  Just a little readjustment fixes the problem.  It's not difficult, just a little bit of a pain.  But it's worth it to not have to destroy the wooden banister to mount the gate.  I recommend this product.",1
Theres nothing more to say.  I have the boy version of this and when you got two kids you have to have the &#34;same&#34; otherwise there is a war.,1
"But my six month old could pull it up off her high chair tray quite easily. I think it would be useful if you're just worried about it accidentally falling over, but if your kid likes to throw things.. this isn't the one for you. The lids do fit well.",0
I purchased these table guards and it was well worth the investment! The corner edge pieces fit perfectly on the edges of my dining room table. It now provides a &#34;cushion&#34; at the table ends and definitely helps prevent an accidental collision. Highly recommended for protection against sharp table ends.,1
This is a very handy product. Makes sterilizing products quick and easy. Wish I had one for my first baby too.,1
"The jumper works. My daughter loves it. But it is the hardest thing to get the baby in. I always end up pinching myself really bad. If I had a doorway to use a doorway jumper I would trash this thing. But, since I don't I have to use it. I only put her in it once a day because it is so hard to get her in it.  If you have a doorway don't use this jumper. If you don't have a doorway it works but be prepared to bite back the swear words as you try to get your baby in it.  If it wasn't so hard to get baby in it then I would give it 5 stars.",0
"I read some of the review before buying this product and some people sand that this product is not heavy and that it was easy to fold and handle. Let me tell you that was not the experience I had. First it doesn&#8217;t  close properly on less you apply a lot of force, I thought I was going to brake it. And my wife wont even touch it . Second is very heavy , I don&#8217;t know if  it is because I drive an chevy Tahoe and had to load this thing through the side door , but it felt like it weight a tone.  So we end up buying another stroller and leaving this one in the garage.me of the review",0
"This was super easy to install, you can either use screws to secure it or not. If you don't use the screw set up it is perfectly solid.  This is tall enough that my dog can't jump it.  He also tried batting it out of the way as well and it held up without moving.  I would recommend this to anyone whether for dogs or kids.",1
"I love this chair. My daughter sits comfortably in it and it makes my life easier with the tray. Less expensive than the Stokke chair and just as nice. Sturdy, safe... Love it.",1
My three year old daughter is always asking me to turn the light on in her room or the bathroom so she can get something or go to the potty right when I am the middle of something else.  This solved the problem.  She loves it.  Works great on our double and triple switch plates.,1
"Perfect for infants that want their pacifier, but can't quite keep it in their mouth without a little help. So cute too!",1
"These are very cute! They are big! Like 12"""" so keep that I'm mind. But very soft & the Hippo is very cute!",1
"when i wash them in water, i found the red and pink one is leak inside. it is some water in it. it is hard to make it dry in the small ball inside. so i can't let my baby play it , because it is wet and hard to clean. i am so disappointed for it.",0
"I do not typically write reviews, but my recent experience warranted for one. My first son was exclusively bottle fed (breasmilk) since he was a lazy nurser and didn't gain weight. My second one who is one month old now is great on the breast but takes his time so if I ever wanted to get out of the house to run an errand I wanted to pump milk and have my nanny feed him. I bought the wide neck Dr. Browns for him, but they made him choke and gag, I think because they are too fast flow. He was also not able to latch onto the nipple which made him swallow a huge amount of air making him gassy and miserable during and after the feeding. Then I tried Tomme Tippee bottles as they were supposed to be closer to the shape of the breast, but maybe not mine as they were even worse than the browns. See, I believe the trick is in the right nipple, because if the nipple is not right for your baby, no matter how advanced venting system is installed in the bottle (dr. brown's) baby will suck in air due to incorrect latching. This is what happened to my baby at least. Desperate, I went to target and bought one of all of the main brands of bottles to try. I found the new medela bottles with the WIDE BASE nipple and since they can be attached to my medela pump I gave them a try first. It was amazing. My LO latched on right away and slowly and comfortably drank the whole bottle without choking or coughing up milk a single time and was happy and content afterwards drifting into sleep like he would on the breast. They work wonderfully.Here is the summary:- BPA FREE, FYI... Medela stuff has always been bpa free, just now they make sure it's written on all of their stuff just like other companies do, who have just switched to bpa free plastic. Don't believe me? Check their website.-In addition to being great bottles the ring and nipple attaches to all other (older) pumping bottles too so I didn't have to buy any more. (all medela stuff has ALWAYS BEEN BPA FREE) This saves money and time too as you don't have to wash as many bottles; you use the same ones for pumping and feeding. Just buy more nipples and rings. Great idea!- Simple construction, only 3 pieces plus a cap vs. 6 pc for dr browns.- There is no venting system, but I believe it is overrated and mostly used for justifying the high price. My LO was very gassy from the dr browns even with the complex venting system.- The nipple is just the right size, not too wide which can be hard to latch onto (tommee tippee) and not too narrow (dr. brown's standard) which can cause nipple confusion.- The slow flow nipple could be a bit slower, although it didn't cause a choking problem. I'm hoping LO will not refuse the breast in hope for the convenient bottle. Will give an update later on this.- Cannot comment on durability as we have just started using them. Will update on this too. My older bottles are very durable, hoping these would be too.Finally... Breast and babies come in different shapes and sizes so what works for me may not work for you. I hope this review helps you to choose, but ultimately it will your baby who makes the final decision. : )",1
"The product itself is good but the sizing for my child is off. My son is 35 lbs but I took measurements of my child and he fell within the medium size measurement wise so i ordered the Medium...it is tight to put on him but once on it does not bother him because the material is very comfortable. He will not be able to put it down himself because the fitting is tight for him. Overall, i think it's a good product and i am ordering the Large(from another amazon vendor as it is slightly cheaper and better shipping charges).",1
"Overall, this product is amazing, and so simple to use!  We bought several of these six months ago because our son figured out how to work doorknobs and all of the other products that are designed to keep kids from opening doors either don't work, are ridiculous to install, or only is usable from one side of the door.  It slips right over the side of the door, and you just push the hook to the side to go into the door.  It's easy enough for a 2 year old to figure out how it works, but as long as it's too high for them to reach, that isn't a problem.We have one on a bathroom door that we remove every time we use that bathroom.  Unfortunately, after 6 months of use, that one broke last night.  The door monkey was on the door, and my 2-year old stood on a chair and put just a little downward pressure on it while he attempted to break into the room, and the long hook broke off, rendering the item useless. (We would put it higher up, but we want our 5 year old to be able to use the bathroom without needing help getting in!)  Fortunately we have several more, and not all of them need to be used at once.If you plan to put one on a door where it will be removed frequently or kept even remotely near a child's reach, I recommend keeping a spare.  If your child figures out all the other childproofing gear in minutes and you need to keep them out of a room, this is the ONLY product I've found that works.  It doesn't matter if your child knows how to work it if he can't reach it!",1
"We actually rented this item from a lady on eBay instead of buying outright and I'm glad we did. Unfortunately, without a crotch strap, it just wasn't enough to keep our 3 year old contained. Our son flies great outside of the buckle up time of take off and landing. My hope was this would be close enough to his car seat restraint that it would make him feel more comfortable and safe, therefore he would wear it. It was a no go. He got right out of it through the bottom and when we did convince him to wear it and he fell asleep, the restraints left marks on his neck (as other reviewers have stated). Overall, I would definitely recommend renting one if you have any concerns about it not working for your family. Our son flat out refused to wear it after the first flight and outside of forcibly holding him in it, it wasn't used again for the rest of the flights. Hope it works for others, but this was our experience. I gave it 2 stars since there was nothing physically wrong with the product, just didn't work for us.",0
"I bought these bottles for my first child 2 years ago and loved them then.  Now with my newborn, they are still like new, and I still love them.  I breastfeed her, but she takes one bottle a day without a problem.  Yes, if the white rim is screwed on too tightly, they will leak.  Simply check before feeding.  I've really enjoyed using there entire feeding system from bottles to sippy cups to sterilizer.  Very well made products.",1
"I love this thing. It portable so my son wears it wherever he is sleeping. We have had a few false positives, but they were all or fault by not securing it well enough on his diaper. Hey I love the fact the alarm goes off after it senses no movement. At least I know its working...:) Best investment we've made. The peace of mind is well worth the money.",1
"I love it because my 5 yr old's head doesn't plop forward anymore BUT it is causing problems with my seatbelt in vehicle.  It's either too high, too forward, too something cuz the belt is starting to get bent.  I'm very disappointed with that.  I've already moved the seat position twice, it's improved but not stopped bending,  we shall see.",1
"Somewhere around 18 weeks, I started becoming so uncomfortable at night.  I have always been a fan of sleeping with multiple pillows, but I was having to build a fortress to get remotely comfortable.  I had read positive reviews of the Snoogle and had seen it at Babies R Us.  I finally had enough and sent this link to my husband at work (BRU is a mile from his office,) and asked him to please bring it home.He came home, exclaiming, ""This was $50!""  I assured him it was the best $50 he has ever spent.  Now, I only sleep with the Snoogle and one other pillow in the open part of the Snoogle.  It is, indeed, huge, so it's a good thing we have a king sized bed.  However, now that I'm at 33 weeks, I can't imagine sleeping without it.  It really helps the back pain.I took off one star because I feel that for the money, the cover could be made of a nicer, softer fabric.",1
"I bought these because of the price, and apart from the lids, they're fine. The problem with the lids is that the disk that sits in the middle is really small & narrow, so it tends to ""slip through"" cracks, either in my dishwasher basket, or in my hands. I'd really prefer a lid that had a bit more substance - it would be much easier to handle.",0
"This is very convenient if you're trying to avoid lugging a huge carseat on board an airplane.  It's FAA approved, but you can't use it in a car, so check that carseat for your end destination...  This thing is about 1 pound (if that) and fits in that little red bag it comes with (I throw it in my purse).  It takes about 30 seconds to install on the plane (the red strap goes around the back of the seat, underneath your friendly neighbor's tray table (so try to get there first!!), and the airplane's seatbelt threads through the bottom of the 2 black straps, forming the harness.  It is a &#34;4 point&#34; harness system, if you will.  There is NOT a strap between the child's legs.  The issue with this is that they will inevitably start slipping down a bit.  If they're crafty, they may squiggle out this way.  I stopped my son by putting my hand there when he tried.  But... be aware that this is a definite downside of the system.  Otherwise, it's great!  You should note the size guidelines, though, because this would not be appropriate for a smaller child.  We used it once my son was 1 year old, but he was an unusual 33 pounds, 33&#34; at that age.",1
"I wish I had started with these with my first child! No leaks, not too bulky. I tend to use the inserts against baby's skin rather than putting them in the pocket though, it seems to work better and can be changed out if wet and sometimes the diaper is not wet, that way and can be reused with new inserts. We tried other cloth diapers and just had leak after leak. None so far with bum genius, even overnight. Very happy!",1
"I love beautiful excellent product, Very good product quality and the colors are super bright, what I liked most was the beautiful quilt.",1
"I have 4 boys, 3 of them are potty trained.  I have had this travel potty for 11 years and I absolutely love it!  It's easy to set up and easy to use.  It uses gallon size zip top bags.  Just use them and find the nearest trash can.  Trust me this potty is a must when traveling or just running around town.  I currently use it for my 2 year old and it is a life saver.  Keep your little one safe and germ free BUY THIS POTTY!!!!!!",1
"I don't have a baby, but I bought these for my bunny, and she really likes picking them up and tossing them!",1
"These are great.  I love the color, and they fit our changing pad well.  I have 2 of them.  Only thing is that they stain with some diaper creams.",1
"I bought this for my daughter because we moved into a new house and she was scared sleeping. This ladybug works awesome, it lights up the whole room in either (pink, green, or blue stars) and shuts off after about 45 mins on its own. She didn't sleep for a while the first night because she was too busy playing with it, but now she wont go go bed without it. Worth every penny. I just wish that it played some music as well, but other then that its a great night light for kids.",1
very spacious unlike many diaper bags I looked at. I reviewed this one prior to purchase and many were happy. It's rare to find functionality and a look of sophistication. I either found one or the other but in this bag I found both. I also like that it gender friendly.,1
This is a great idea. But it's just cheap quality materials and a cheap way of doing it. It really didn't work had to throw it away after just two weeks of use when it broke. Then we got the one by safety 1st and it works beautifully. It's a much higher quality product. Go for the one by safety 1st. http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001JT1QN6/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1371446810&sr=8-1&pi=SL75,0
"The star things asked me about a toy, so that might not make since- but I bought this at Babies R Us, and the first time I washed it the fabric just kind of fell apart on one of the bumpers. $160 is too much money to spend on cheap, crappy fabric that falls apart when washed. My baby never even got to use this. It tore up before he was born.",0
These ice packs have lasted a while and they don't leak like many have. Good for school lunches. A good size to fit in lunch boxes.,1
"This is the first time I bought a video baby monitor, I always had the traditional audio monitor - the idea to SEE the baby not only tolisten gives me a great level of comfort knowing that I can be busy with any tasks i need to do around the house and my child is safe. I did do some research before buying this unit and found it to be the best value for the price, mainly the remote pan and tilt feature to see several angels of the room and the 3.5 inch screen, that wasimportant for me. As for quality so far it looks durable and works around my house if we have any problems we will update, but so far it seems to be a good product and a great price too !!!",1
"I wish I had gotten this from the very beginning of my daughter's birth.  She is currently 8 months.  We just got it recently because we have been doing some sleep training with her where we were letting her cry for a while.  The video monitor makes the training so much easier to handle as a mother.  I also enjoy just watching my baby sleep which was something that I was able to do when she was a newborn when nothing could wake her up, but now I am too scared to wake her up with any slight noise I make if I went in her room.  It is also nice for babysitters so they feel more assured by noises they may hear from the baby's room.  The grandparents feel like they got to see her even though she is only sleeping.I definitely recommend this if you can afford the splurge.  This particular model the screen is nice and big but I've also tried the 1.8"" one and it was fine too.  Actually the 1.8"" one had slightly better video quality.  The color does not work on either one unless the room is very brightly lit (the manual notes this too), so unless you have a baby who doesn't mind sleeping in a bright room, you won't ever see color.One function I find lacking is a screen brightness option.  It is really bright and hard on the eyes when you flip it on in the middle of the night to see what is going on with the baby.  But other than that, I don't have any complaints.",1
My grandson is a big Thomas fan and he absolutely loved it.  Just the right for his little hands.  Good quality pieces and were as described.,1
These are great!  I put them in the carseats for the accidents that happen when my kids fall asleep in the carseat as they have not yet learned to wake up when they have to use the potty.  I take an extra second to straighten them before the kids sit down and then they stay in place just fine.  The car seat covers are a pain to get off for washing so these help to prevent frequent washings of the car seat covers.Adding some velcro would make these perfect!,1
This matches so well with the bedding ans other accessories that we bought foe my daughters room. Definitely recommend for HK fans.,1
"I used these as soon as I started nursing my son in the hospital as my nipples were quite sore. After my milk came in and my breast started leaking milk while nursing on the other, the milk collected in the cups would leak out. When I went out if any slight pressure was applied to my chest area, which would cause the cups to shift even a little the milk collected would leak out and drench my clothes from cheat to waist. I had to remove the cup and empty them as soon as I felt the milk leaking. Where they rested against my skin would sweat and remain wet, my nipples would also be remain sweaty and by the time I was ready to nurse my son again I first had to wash my nipples them first. It even smelled sweaty. Thank God my nipples got used to the sucking and they are no longer sore, so I no longer need to use the shield.",0
Helped my toddler learn when it was morning. It took a few days of being consistent and rewards if he stayed in his room until &#34;the bunny was awake&#34;.,1
"I'm so glad to get all of my daughters stuffed animals under control! Now we just rotate out a hand full at a time so that she doesn't get bored with them, and her room isn't over taken.",1
"This really helped our baby sleep better. Made her feel safe and secure, so she slept longer. Can't say enough. This is a Must Have.",1
This bottle is just convenient.  The price doesn't seem too bad but my kids like this a lot and wouldn't use any other bottle.,1
"These are more like large washcloths. They're soft but so small that they're not highly useful for real life. They'd be better if either smaller or larger but seem kind of inadequate as they are. They ARE moisture resistant, not sure if they're really moisture PROOF as we didn't use so much due to their size.",0
"My family criticized me for this purchase because it looks like a prison. BUT, they are modular and the more you buy, the more space you have. I bought two of them and use them for a variety of different things. Including a gate for the stairs. This has prevented plenty of bumps and bruises I am sure.",1
"As a lightweight stroller, it serves its purpose.  It actually feels about 10 pounds, fits well inside the trunk and also easy to open and close.  The colors available are all sharp and pretty pleasing.  It's also hard to get dirty, which is a plus.  The downside is that the harness between the legs are sewn in too far distal in the seat so that a smaller kid (and my baby is already 13 months) tend to slide forward in the seat so that he ends up slumped down instead of properly in the angle of the seat.  The handlebars are sort of short and your back gets tired easily.  Also, my stride is sort of long and my feet keeps on bumping into the wheels.",0
We were given this pacifier at the hospital because my daughter didn't know how to suck when she was first born(she just chomped down which was pretty painful...). She took it right away and it was nice we could see the way she was sucking through the hole. At home we have about five different brands of pacifiers and this is still the only one she likes (though sometimes she will take a soothie). One nice thing that I love compared to the soothies is that the handle part has a hole in it so I can attach a pacifier holder thing that attaches to her shirt.,1
"I just bought this oven front lock for the third time, and I'm not complaining.  For the price, it is a wonderful solution (especially if there's no room for a side lock).  But it will eventually break down and stop locking.  I've had to replace mine every 8 months or so.One key tip: just use superglue to get it to stick.  The adhesive on the lock is crap--it can't withstand the heat of the oven, and it won't stay on if your kids like to hang on the oven door handle (god, I wish I could get them to stop that!).  But with superglue it will last for months and months.",1
"Before I bought these I read all the reviews about how they leak and then some people said they didn't. I decided to try them anyway because they were so cute. I got them, and I'm not a dumb person. I know how to put a lid on something, and no matter what I do it still leaks. The bottom won't leak too bad if you screw it on tight, but no matter how you put the lid on, when you turn it upside down to put the milk in, it leaks.. which is very frustrating when it's pumped milk (liquid gold) The good thing was that my baby loved the bottle, but they were really annoying to use and they yellowed after about 15 uses.  I got the 0-3 months to try them out and when he grew out of them I just got advent bottles, which he likes just as much and they're also BPA free. Overall, I was pretty unsatisfied with them, and the people on here saying they don't leak... I think they might be paid by adiri to say that, because everyone I've talked to who has used them has said they leak.",0
"I bought these for my son, he is a little small for them still but he looks adorable with them on for the 1.2 seconds they last on his head. They shipped quickly and seem a moderately sturdy. I feel, for the price, they are a good buy.",1
i did not aware that should be put a battery to charge a monitorBecause I have a chicco monitor charged without a batteryand everything is ok,1
"Great product for potty training, you can throw it in the wash and put it back in in no time. It made things easier for my daughter who stressed out when she realized she had to go right now and I could not stop the car.Yes it could be made better (find a way to make it stay put) but it does what you need it to.",0
"First, I'm actually glad it comes in a 2 pack.  One star off for being from China and forcing a thorough cleaning before he could play with them.  #1 for me is that they make my little boy happy and keep him occupied.  I like the two pack because he can lose or misplace a few (or several) links and still have plenty to play with.",1
"The brush is perfect for cleaning inside my Dr. Brown's bottles, until you take the brush out.  I was surprised with a spray of water splattering all over me!  My kitchen sink isn't very big, so I tried to do it low and sideways so I wouldn't get sprayed, but when I did that, my counter would get sprayed.  The nipple cleaner works well and the stand is nice, but due to the spraying nature of the bottle brush, I deducted a star.UPDATE (9/22/12) - These brushes do not last, i had to purchase another one since the top bristles of the brush eventually get flattened which renders it useless.  The second one just bit the dust.  I am not trying out other brushes, the Philips Avent one and Dr. Browns to see which one will last.",0
"I can't expect it to always maneuver in the most awesome way, because anything meant to hold that much weight is going to test my strength at some point, right? I got my first taste of using this as a double this weekend- two 1yos. I've got to say, it still handled great! I don't know how much weight the negative maneuver comments were based off but seriously, you can only expect so much.When we got this double in the mail a few weeks ago we took it for walks right away, including the mall- it was the perfect size to still cruise through the shops (which is one of the reasons I didn't want a side by side). It was also great to find that this thing folded up so slim for restaurants.I love love the hand break- it's way more secure of a lock than the Chiccos we've owned.I was concerned about the basket size but when you unzip to expand the back it held our bag (which is a full size backpack), two jackets, and two regular sized left over boxes. That's pretty impressive to me.I do wish it had a built in console but I will be buying the cheapie Diono soon as was suggested by other reviews I found (cheaper than baby jogger brand one and more reliable for some reason). I'll take the bite for $6 bucks.",1
"I read through the countless reviews for this chair here and other places, read all the 1 star reviews and kind of brushed them off because it was stupid things like &#34;oh my baby hates it&#34; or &#34;the package was destroyed.&#34; Not enough to deter my purchase for sure.The chair is really easy to assemble and I did so in about 5 minutes. The booster seat is a good option to put on another chair when my little guy gets a bit older. The only problem I had was that at the Max height and it barely goes over our dining table (which is a bit helpful to aid his messiness. Not a big deal at all, just wanted that &#34;1 more click higher&#34; option.The chair itself is easy to clean off, pretty much grab a paper towel and add some cleaning vinegar and &#34;woosh&#34; all clean. The table is easy to wipe off or stick in the dishwasher and clear that off as well. What I do for the straps is pull them off and toss them in the laundry machine and they clean off really fast there too (I put them in the drier with other clothes I am doing, but my wife just air dries them, either way seems fine).I really do recommend this chair based on the convertablness (yup made that word up) and with Graco, I have rarely ever gone wrong with one of their products.",1
"I have a same mirror installed in one of our family car and it is terrific. Since it did a really good job, we decided to buy another one for another car. Too bad, this time the mirror quality is below expectation. Reflections are deformed. No other choice, we returned this mirror. BRICA need to do a better job in quality control!",0
I purchased this for my 18 month old. She loves to get into everything and climb on everything. Potty training was going well. We put the gate up in the hall so she had access to the bathroom but not the rest of the house at night and we keep the gate propped open all day. I would recomend.,1
"We started using these with our first daughter, and overall, we're very pleased with them. We used these to transition from breast-feeding and that went without a hitch. The thing we noticed though is that the harder, inner nipples started to break-down and crack after a few months. One-by-one, we had to start throwing them away, so I went ahead and purchased this Breastflow Stage 2 Nipple 2 Pack to replace them. To be absolutely honest, these have held-up even worse. I purchased them on June 10th, and as of today (July 26th), the end of one of them has completely deteriorated and the other has very noticeable cracks. That's a whole lot less life than I was expecting, especially since my daughter is having fewer bottles than she used to.Overall, we still like the Breastflow bottles, but the durability of the inner nipples really leaves something to be desired. It's also a shame that they aren't sold separately at a lower price point, because that would probably make buying more a little bit less of an offense. While I doubt we'll be changing bottles with my oldest (now weaning her off the bottle at 21 months), we'll definitely be looking for another product when our 4 month old twins are ready for them.",0
"I absolutely love this bag.  It's nice and roomy and has lots of pockets and compartments, which any mom knows is a must have.  I wish I had this on from the beginning of ""mommyhood"".  It's a high quality item!  Highly recommend!!",1
"These are my favorite wipes EVER, and I've tried just about everything on the market (both disposable and cloth). I use them withPrince Lionheart Premium Wipe Warmer. Just fold them in half, wet with warm tap water, wring out, and place in the warmer...12-14 wipes will fit in the warmer at a time. They are perfect for not only cleaning butts, but wiping slobbery mouths and giving sponge baths too. They are by far the softest wipes/washcloths I've ever used. As another reviewer noted the two fabrics do ""slide"" across one another but I've never found that to cause a problem. They've lasted through hundreds of machine washings/dryings and I've had no issues with staining, ripping, fraying, or fading. I've found that having 24 of these on hand is about right to get me though a full day. Can't say enough good things about this product!",1
"I picked this window valance because it doesn't seem too babyish to me. I'm decorating a nursery for my first baby and I wanted a room the baby could grow up in at least for a little while. My husband and I also don't know the gender of the baby so this is great for a boy or a girl. I did have to iron the valance before I put it up because it was very wrinkled. Other than that, a great pick!",1
"Was very excited to find a reasonably priced Diaper bag that doesn't scream diaper bag.  It is a quality product; from the leather, the zippers, snaps, the lining in the bag and side pockets, the straps and rings, and even the changing pad; may seem trivial, but it isn't to me. The Changing pad that came with the first bag I ever owned was thin and cheap and an all around disappointment. This  pad is thicker and the plastic material is of good quality.  VERY happy with this purchase!  The bad arrived on time and in perfect condition.",1
"I cannot wait until my granddaughter's Nursery is set up to see how it actually looks on the crib ,since the nursery will be done in Dr. Suess.",1
"We own two of these.  One in pink, one in purple.  We bought the second one after the tab on the lid of the first broke, thinking it was a fluke.It wasn't.The tabs to open/close the cover for the straw broke on both of the bottles we have, in a short amount of time.  The lid does not have a gasket but rather is a plastic to plastic connection, so it leaks if turned certain ways.  The design on the front of the bottle fades and completely rubs off after a few weeks.  These were hand washed every time (never in a dish washer), so it wasn't exposed to high drying heat.It holds water, and has a nice flexible straw, which makes it easy to drink out of, as long as your munchkin keeps it vertical.  It doesn't do much to prevent spills, and if left on its side will leak from the threads and leave a large puddle wherever it sits.Overall, it gets a 3 because it is easy to drink out of and hold, but we won't be buying more.",0
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this toy!  It's awesome.  I really believe that kids don't need toys that light up and sing.  I agree with the statement, ""The less the toy does, the more the child will do.""  My daughter is 14 months and loves this toy.  However, the toy did have some plastic stuck to the paint, like it was put in packaging before the paint dried, or the packaging melted onto the toy in spots.  I wouldn't give this toy as a gift to anyone outside of my family for that reason.  It looks pretty tacky with the melted plastic stuck to it.  Otherwise, I love this toy.",1
works fine easy to use . The sound is fine as is the picture. I would buy again most likely,1
"i love this car seat cover! fits nicely, its stylish & it does what its intended to do! keep baby covered!",1
"I adored this for my soon-to-be-born-nephew-to-golfing-parents the second I saw it.  I knew I had to order it and once I did I was so excited.  Then it arrived, and man, it has to be the CUTEST outfit ever!  It is even cuter in person.  Not to mention, the little golf cart packaging is so adorable itself!  All I need now is a cute little pair of khaki shorts to go with it and he will be the stud of my brother and sister-in-law's course!",1
"well, this is not a firm mattress. I do not think this mattress is good for a new born because is not sturdy at all. But if you want to buy a not expensive matress for a toddler, I think this is perfect. It worked for my daughter. She is transitioning from my bed to hers. Its still hard to make her sleep all night on her bed, but we are getting there.",0
"This monitor is the greatest thing I have ever purchased! My son is the greatest sleeper and I give so much of the credit to this monitor! I never have to sneak in to see what he is doing, so I never accidentally wake him.  I never have to guess if he is stuck in the crib, if he is really asleep, or wonder what he is doing.  If he wakes in the night I can see if he is just trying out a new skill, or if he really needs me.The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the battery tends to lose it's charge fairly quickly (we called Summer Infant and they sent us a new one, free ), the original monitor we purchased broke after lightly dropping it and it says ""color monitor"" but it barely shows any color at all.  Other than that is is great!!!",1
These are good and my boys wouldnt use any other kind but they cost so much I have twins so I need double the amount that a single baby has I tried the Dr browns stage 3 nipples and the switch was no problem they are exactly the same I bought mine in the store for $3 and the Playtex ones wee $5 and having to buy 8 packs it was a lot less money that's my only problem with these,1
"This is the best toy we have bought.  We got it a week before our son turned 4 months, he's now 6 1/2 months and he still plays in it every day.  The toys pop out and pop in to our other evenflo products.  It was a great investment!",1
"I love this nightlight, but when my son had a tummy ache the other night, I layed in his bed with him, and this is one bright night light. He has it on ""green"". Not sure if that color is brighter than the others, but I could probably have read a book by this light. He is able to sleep, though....",0
Intially I was trying tobuy convertible seat good from 5 -40 lb. But preice of infant seat and infant to 40 lb is same . I like quality of fiber and ease of setting seat in and taking it out .,1
We really love this mobile!  My 4 yr old loves the remote and he runs away with it all the time.  The music and sounds are great and my 7 wk old LOVES to watch the animals go around,1
"Nice and sturdy and good quality.  The cup holders are smaller (as many reviews mentioned) but good size for water bottle, small soda or similar.  Not recommended for hot drinks (but do you really want a hot drink by your baby?!)  Overall good quality for the price and fits perfect with my baby jogger mini select GT stroller!",1
"I LOVE the Ergo Baby carrier!  I have used it with my daughter since she was about 1 month old.  I also had a wrap and while it was OK in the newborn stage it just didn't have the support the Ergo did for me or my baby.  I had a large baby (10+ lbs at birth) and never used the infant insert.  It seemed to be a waste of money in my opinion.  We just positioned her so she was ""frog-legged"" inside which kept her head up above the fabric so she could breathe and see easily.  My husband even loves this and wears her in it all the time.  My one complaint is that I wish there were some longer tabs on the back strap so I could more easily reach to tighten it when I don't have someone to help me.  But this is super comfortable for both baby and me, provides great back support with the waist band and back strap and my baby loves it - hardly ever cries once we put her in it!  That's definitely worth the money! :)",1
"Although this blanket is soft and cute, the shedding is terrible! I washed and dried this blanket three times, and used almost an entire lint roller on it, and it is still shedding everywhere.  It sheds all over everything it touches. Not sure how much more time I'm willing to spend washing and using the lint roller on it. Pretty disappointed.",0
"This is my first time nursing and this bra has been great to help me adjust. It fits great, is easy to use and actually adds value unlike a lot of things marketed to moms.",1
"I bought this for a gift, but I own one and love it.  We use it for going out to eat...don't have to wonder how clean the table is for my 1 year old.  When we're done, I roll it up, stuff it in the diaper bag, and wash it when we get home.",1
"This has to be one of the coolest straw cups I have seen. I was skeptical at first when my mommy friends raved about the ZoLi cup. When I first received it, my son (9.5 months) had no interest in it whatsoever. I finally put milk in it, and he discovered how to suck out of the straw to get something out of the cup. It was awesome! The weighted straw makes it so he can hold it upright, sideways, or upside down and still get something out of the cup. The versatility of this has been super.What do I hate about it? The bottom of the cup! As you can see in the photo, it has a rim around the bottom of the cup. I would expect a cup that is 15ish dollars to take a beating pretty well. Babies and toddlers drop cups; I would hope one was made will enough to withstand that. Unfortunately, the bottom rim has broken off because of it being dropped. I call that poor quality and very disappointing. We are still using the cup with 1/2 of the bottom broken off (it keeps chipping in pieces), but it's definitely annoying",0
"This was a fun activity to have people do while the mother-to-be was opening gifts at her shower.  Hopefully she recieved some good tips, too.",1
it works! I used it everyday about 2 months sine she was 3 months old . it was a slow process . I am glad i found this pillow . it worked! no more flat spot! .thank you.,1
I love the look of this crib sheet. Perfect for my sons crib and you don't need a crib bumper.,1
"I bought this item in a local store to toss our little girls laundry into for laundry day.  I think it lasted all of 2-3 months before the support rods poked a hole in the material and would no longer stay in.  As others have said, If I had known it had support rods I would not have ought it and since I have bought something with a bit more integrity to it.",0
"I bought this for my infant grandson.  He would only take the pacifier the hospital gave him to comfort him.  In desperation, I found the same pacifier on Amazon.  However, there were animals attached. I've never seen one and it fit perfect with his ""Jungle"" theme.  He LOVED it.  The plush toy allowed him pick up his own pacifier with his little uncoordinated hands.  Only problem, I had to buy a second one so we could take away the first one long enough to wash and dry it. A+ product, shipping and cost.  Well worth it.  Thank you.",1
"This bed is awesome -looks cute, rocks and snuggle the baby.With my first baby I used bassinet for first 3 months and poor baby got the flat spot (it disappeared with growing). In a Snugabunny there is an incline and that helps take the weigh form the back of the head. I will update later to see if that work well to keep baby's head nicely rounded.Baby truly sleeps longer in it because it's snuggled.This little bed it's light and portable, very easy to assemble (no tools required and so easy no need for instructions too). It takes two hand to press the buttons to fold it though, but it is doable with baby in the hands.I placed 25 lb baby and there was no room to snap the belt around legs, so this will definitely work only for smaller babies. That makes sense, they can be in it until they start getting mobile, otherwise older babies would wiggle to much and could fall over. The weigh limit is more to be safe.",1
Used it to travel via plane... Roomy enough to hold the booster and child's blanket or jacket. Has held up the last two years we used it and still looks like new.,1
"This product is great, I've ordered it twice now in the past year and have been very satisfied both times - However - I've also been lucky enough to receive the same style chew toy both times (the blue cat).  It's important to note that many kids with sensory issues have autism and don't cope well with change.  These toys can be somewhat hard to find so ordering without knowing which one will be sent to you can be tricky, I just know I would never have heard the end of it if we'd gotten a yellow train instead of a blue cat! (I heaved a great sigh of relief when I opened the package - it's the little things, right?!)  I would order again because the item is great (nice size, lanyard with safety clasp, durable) but, like many reviewers before me, feel the seller should include an option to choose which charm is being ordered.",1
"No issues with leaking or breaks. Compatible with zoli, they are the same cup essentially. Great as a bottle transition.",1
I really like these and I like being able to put my baby's food in bowls rather than just on the tray. My only minor complaint is that I wish all the bowls came with lids.,1
"The rails on my crib are wider, so longer strings would be nice, as I really had to stretch it to get it to tie.",1
"it's so soft, and I love the fabric and will recommend it to all my friends.",1
"I bought those nipples because I thought they will be less hard than those in silicone, but I was wrong, they were harder and moreover the smell of latex was very strong...",0
"I'm very happy with the seat. My son has been using it for a few months now (ever since we potty-trained him). It fit well on a regular-sized toilet seat and is soft and comfy, and is easily cleaned.",1
I like the pendent it's very pretty  the neckless is a little small but over all I like it alot,1
"I don't have any particular preference for Avent's bottles or other products in general, but I used this Avent bottle brush at a friend's house and immediately went out and got my own. I can't imagine ever again using one of those spiral deals with the wire down the middle... *shudder*  Get this brush and get on with your dishes.",1
For my 4 1/2 month old son it's a little to heavy for him to hold to his mouth. It can be placed in the fridge and the beads make it useful as a rattle. As he gets older and stronger it may be a better teether.,1
Fuzzi Bunz are very easy to use. The inner fleece is so soft against my baby's skin and the insert absorbs a lot. We never have leaks. Highly recommend.,1
I love this product. I saw it an a store but later that day I looked it at amazon. I bought it for my niece and my wife also loves it. I will buy it for my kid too.,1
"When I first got this product, I was happy to see how sturdy it was.  Other carriers that I have looked at were made very cheaply and did not feel that it would be entirely sturdy to hold a baby.  With this classic carrier, I am confident that it will hold a baby securly and comfortable.  Will definitely recommend.",1
I wanted to find a crib sheet to match my crib comforter and came across this one.  It is soft and fits the crib perfectly.  I would recommend it to anybody.,1
"Like many other reviewers, I had those old ones that were great for a while. Then we changed them all for the BPA free version and they all leaked. We liked the bottles (others on the market are not even close), but we had to re-tighten the lid again and again as it would leak and leak. When I bought these bottles in question (the new version of BPA free) I was cautious. However, it does not leak ever, 100%. We have our bottles back!!! Buy it before they ""improve"" something else and they start leaking again :)",1
This is a gorgeous baby teether and ships quickly. It looks beautiful and I love wearing it. Great gift idea and keepsake too.,1
"This is a wonderful, smooth, firm, delightful chewing toy -so it's really a shame we can't use it.  The giraffe's legs are so long that my daughter is always gagging herself with them.  Other reviewers describe babies actually choking on the legs, which is scary.  It's otherwise so well thought out, this flaw is bizarre.  It ought to be recalled and corrected.  They DO make another teether -it looks like a little alien- with no long appendages and she loves it, so I would recommend that instead (look for Vulli Teether)",0
"I mean for the price you spend on this, it is great quality.. It would cost more to make yourself so why not get this one! It is a little larger than I had pictured but that just means my daughter can wear it longer!!",1
"Only thing I noticed different than the main brand is that the writing isn't in color so it's hard to see, but over all no difference and super great price.",1
"I can really only speak to the assembly and aesthetics at this point. I haven't actually had my child yet so it has  not been used. But it looks exactly as pictured. For some reason, none of our parts were labeled. They were supposed to have identifying stickers. It made assembly a bit of a headache, but it wasn't unbearable. It just was annoying to think you had something together and then you didn't.I will update it if anything pertinent comes up!",1
"Definitely does what it claims: keeps baby from opening drawers and smashing fingers.  It does take a little getting used to since it's hard to unlatch the lock when you do have to open the drawer. Regardless, it's a small price to pay if you don't want to see your child crying in pain from smashing his/her fingers. Ouweee!",1
We researched many bathtubs before purchasing this one.  We only have a shower in our home and our son was outgrowing his infant tub.  We finally decided on this tub and I am glad because it has worked well for us.  Our 16 month old son has plenty of room and when the tub is dry we can fold it up and put it away.,1
"This high chair may be pretty, but it is a wobbly piece of junk.  When we purchased it, there were huge cracks in the wood and parts missing.  I would never put a baby 3 feet off the ground in this thing.  I am a mom who is normally against craptastic plastic and liked the idea of this high chair's aesthetic, but I can recognize a polished turd when I see one.",0
"This product folds nicely, and looks nice. It does not cling as advertised. Cleaning the windows several times did not help, it kept falling. Also, the size is lacking, if it did stick it should have covered more of the window. I would not recommend this product. I returned the item for a refund.",0
"First, the distance on these are no more than 75 feet - which is much different that the advertised distance,Secondly, the screen on ours has been having issues.  It only shows part of the screen making it impossible to read any information on the monitor - which defeats the purpose of using it.My wife emailed VTech and was given a prompt response that she would be contacted within 48 hours by a CSR.  2 weeks later she sent another email and finally was given a response in broken English on how to fix it.We went through the process given to us to try and fix it and still no luck, so we emailed back telling them that we tried it a few times and still are having the same issues.We then received an email back with the same instructions on how to fix it.We are now waiting on another email back on the next steps, which will probably be the same instructions on how to try and fix it....I will update this if we ever get a proper response back from VTech.  For now I would not recommend this product as it didn't even last 6 months and dealing with their customer service has been a terrible experience.UPDATE:We finally got a response back from VTech and they want us to ship the broken unit to them on our dime. Two issues with this: why should it cost us when it is still under warranty and their defective product, and we can't go without the parent unit for weeks and we ship back and wait for a new unit.I asked them to send the new unit along with a return mailing label and we will gladly mail it back - they refused.I am not one to complain, but dealing with VTech has been the worse experience in a very long time. I own a business and couldn't imagine treating my clients this way, especially when it's my product that is the issue.We have told VTech that unless they ship a new unit first we will just go ahead and purchase a different product through a company that stands behind their products.DO NOT buy from VTECH, unless you like headaches.",0
"This is our third potty and it has proven the best.  We have one potty that looks like a toy and plays all different sounds, and a padded seat that fits on our toilet.  This potty has proven the best.  It looks cool, fits my daughter perfectly, stores toilet paper and wipes, and my daughter can stand on it as a stool.I love the design and appearance.  Where was this when I first started lookng for a potty?",1
These are much thicker than other ones I have bought.  They actually catch the poop in stead of letting it leak through to the diaper!  (I use this with my 3 month old)  Definitely keep buying these!!,1
"Well I gave this a long fair shot and really tried to like it, but it has one annoying downfall and one major issue which finally killed it and forced me to move on. Here are the pros & cons:Pros:1) Clear strong reception2) Great night vision picture quality3) Paired easily and quick set upCons:1) When in sleep mode, the sound turns off as well - there is no way to turn the screen off to save power and still hear the baby. Annoying2) After just one year of use, the battery no longer holds a charge and needs to be plugged in constantly. The internal battery is NOT replaceable.Final verdict: DO NOT PURCHASE!",0
"does what it is intended to do, protect knees.  elastic is not to tight or loose, it doesnt leave a ring on leg.  my baby is average, not really chubby legs.",1
"I was determined to use glass bottles for my son, I didn't want to have to worry about plastics.  These are nice solid bottles that I am extremely pleased with.  The teachers at his daycare often tell me how much nicer they are than any of the other bottles and that the milk stays warmer longer.These are heavier then plastic, but my son (now 9 mo.) is able to hold them and feed himself, he has been for a few months now.  So, they are obviously not too heavy for him.I have seen some complaints about the multiple parts, but I don't mind them.  It really doesn't take that much longer to wash an extra piece or two.  My son hasn't had any gas issues and has spit-up maybe 6 times in his whole life.  I don't know if this is because of the bottles or not, but if taking more time to wash an extra piece means that he's gas and spit-up free, I'm ok with it.  I am a working Mom, so I understand the value of time, but I also understand the value of quality.It took me a while, but I was finally able to find and purchase a few Born Free Pump Adaptors.  They work perfectly with these bottles (and the 9 oz.) and my Medela Pump In Style.  I wish I had found them sooner, they are definitely worth it!  It is so nice to be able to pump directly into the bottles and not deal with as many plastic bags.I have also purchased the separate pieces to transform these into sippy cups and I love that these bottles can grow with him.",1
"I purchased this monitor while expecting my 2nd child.  I currently use another brand for my toddler and have never had any issues with static, etc.  I found compared to the current monitor I use, that the sound quality on this one was very poor with little depth to the sound.  It was difficult to discern normal crib movement versus him making noise. It frequently got interference and turned to static even though I use it in the next bedroom over!  I did like the small, slim and convenient size though.  I ended up returning it and purchasing another brand.",0
"The nipple pictured is not a stage two nipple it is the spoon nipple. If you want a stage two nipple order this, if you want a spoon nipple don't order this. My son is 6 months old and is breastfed and bottle feeds when I am at work two days a week. I find this nipple to be a little fast flowing for him.  He prefers the stage one nipple and will drink an eight ounce bottle easily from this nipple and has no problems going back to the breast. Love this nipple and the bottles that go with.",1
Kinda ok for me but it just doesn't rock much and the toy should design to swirl towards the back instead of the front.,1
"I think every mom is different, so I don't think this is a ""one size fits all"" solution, but they worked for me.  I appreciated that this was a combination of the common blessed thistle and fenugreek.  One less pill to take!  I also think it actually works BETTER than the combination of the other two.  I'd say its worth the money.",1
"This blanket is a gift, and it looks great. I am sure the mother will love it, she had it on her registry.",1
Waste of money! My daughter would not suck these to soothe herself when she was upset or to sleep! Think the spout/bulb part that goes into her mouth is a weird shape and not comfortable to suck or easy for baby to keep in her mouth!,0
"Each of my daughters have a SS and love them.  I borrowed one of theirs because I babysit every day and the oldest was ready for solids.  I waned to try it before I bought it.  The SpaceSaver is exactly that.  I got rid of my big high chair and used this exclusively.  Fantastic product.  I bought two for my house as the youngest is now ready for solids.  Unfortunately, I ended up with the so called new and improved model.  They took away the arms on the sides and changed the way it reclines. The older model reclined using the entire seat, not just the upper portion of the seat back.  It's flimsy and I'm not sure it'll hold up.  It screams ""cheap"", which this chair is not (to purchase).  Also, the removal of the arms makes it difficult to use the tray.  It's hard to remove/attach the feeding tray to the new model and it doesn't adjust as well as the older one.  Definately not a one handed job, which is vital when trying to hold a baby while putting them in the chair.  When in recline, you can't get as close to the baby because of the new way it reclines.  I'm not overly impressed with their supposed improvements.  I must prefer the older model.  That one gets a 5 star rating because I love it.  It's perfect and will last until they are able to sit in a regular chair.  This new one is just OK, hence the 3 stars.  If I had a ""do over"" I wouldn't have purchased the new model.  I would have paid a few dollars more for the older one, even though I couldn't find a seat cover that matched my decor like this one does.,My recommendation is to get the older model, with the arms, and you will be thrilled with the SpaceSaver. This model, not so much.MeMe Lisa",0
"I have had this about two years and have stopped using it. Basically, early on, the poles that keep it from collapsing (and yes, it uses poles and is not the type that has internal wires supporting the sides) bent with the weight of the clothes being carried to the laundry room. They had to be discarded. So now it has no structure. Very low quality as far as durability. It was cute enough but it did not last a few months for us.  My suggestion would be not to use it to actually carry the clothes. The material was the typical you see in this type of hamper. Without lugging it around by the handles, it would have lasted longer for us certainly.",0

"This is the third car seat that we've gotten for my son and I wish we'd had this one from the start. It's much softer and cushioned that his two previous seats (Graco SnugRide Classic Connect 30 LX Infant Car Seat, Metropolis andSafety 1st All-in-One Convertible Car Seat, Scribbles) and seems much safer. I don't like how other reviewers are saying that you ""get what you pay for"" and complaining that this seat doesn't fit their car. This seat is expensive for a lot of people, not everyone can afford to buy a $300 or more car seat. And if the seat doesn't fit in your car, that doesn't make it a bad seat, so that shouldn't affect the review. We have a 4-door Pontiac G6, and this seat does fit rear-facing in the center of the back seat, and it also fits behind the passenger seat. Yes, the passenger seat had to be pushed forward, but in my opinion it wasn't so far forward that it was unusable. We're having baby #2 in a few months and we plan on getting another Safety 1st Complete Air Protect seat. My son will have to be scooted over from the middle to the side, and so will the new baby, so the ""wings"" next to their heads and the over-all safety rating of the seat make me feel much better about them being right next to the car door. This seat is lightweight, safe, soft, and allows baby/toddler to remain rear-facing longer than a lot of other seats. I have no complaints and I'm pretty picky! I'm so relieved to feel like we've finally found a great car seat.My only suggestion, not really a complaint, but something you may want to purchase with the seat, is strap covers (We hadBrica Cushies Button Up Strap Covers, Gray/Blue/Greenthat we purchased with his first seat) because this seat doesn't come with any. And an insert, likeKiddopotamus Snuzzler Complete Head and Body Support, Ivory Terry, if you're going to have a newborn in the seat, or else you'll have to roll up receiving blankets around the baby.",1
"I was disappointed to find that this name brand item was such a dud. I COULD NOT HEAR MY BABY, which defeats the purpose of a monitor. I didn't have any bulb or battery problems, as others did. Every time my baby cried, the monitor did not go on, which is one of the features I was seriously looking foward to. The only nice feature is the pretty fish projection and sounds. Since I already threw out the box, I cannot return it, so I will use the projector feature. along with purchasing another monitor.",0
My infant is 3 months old and is just starting to grasp toys. This toy is easy for him to hold and the slightest movement makes the inside ball make noise. He loves playing with it because it doesn't require a wide grip.,1

The Diono black shade arrived in a rolled package and it is a 2-pack!  I was worried and wasn't sure since the description lacked this detail.  It was fairly easy to unroll and install on the two rear windows of our 2008 Ford Escape.  The static cling tint covered about 85-90% of the rear window and reduced the sun's glare effectively.,1
"I have a Maclaren twin techno and before my children were born, I travelled a lot.  I was committed to bringing my babies with me as often as I could when I travelled and was looking out for travel paraphernalia that would ease the hassels of travelling with twins.  Hence, I came to this product, and though it was more than twice as much as the others, it was the only one that had wheels, and the only one specifically made for the maclaren strollers which has always been known to produce quality products.  The first one came already ripped at the seams.  I didn't think much of this as it was not tested on any of my flights, I didn't think it was a product failing.  I had it returned for free and exchanged for another one which I used one time for my travel to Israel from Los Angeles.  The bag ripped even before our arrival to Israel as I used it to protect my twin techno which was gate checked.  The bag was not useable after that first and only flight.  Unfortunately, I was so busy with my twins that the 90 days had passed since I had the second bag and Amazon would not take it back without me having to have it shipped myself, which, again I couldn't do for lack of time.  But had the bag withstood it's maiden voyage, I woulnd't be dealing with the issue of returning a defective product.  Long story short, it's a cheap product that costs too much.  Stay away.",0
"As for snack bowl, it's great to hold Puffs, Cheerios or any other little snack. As for actually holding them in, well, that depends on how old your child is. At 9 months, mine figured out that if she held one of the tabs down and shook, all the snack would come tumbling down. Turned out to be a pretty fun game after while. So 3 stars for functionality, and 4 for entertainment value!",0
"This really is the ultimate receiving blanket! Besides being the perfect size for swaddling (and a handy little swaddling tutorial printed on every label)  it's great for just about any situation, is just the right size and is not too heavy or too light. I've used it to: toss over the stroller when the baby is sleeping, folded it up on my lap to provide support for baby's head while nursing, covered the baby to keep him warm with room left to wipe drool :) It comes in a wide array of colors to match any nursery!",1
"I love my video monitor it gives me peace of mind to see my baby at all times. It's been great for traveling too with the battery friendly camera (although the batteries run out really fast). I wish the camera had a rechargeable battery like the screen to move around easily, and I also wish the sensitivity button were in the screen instead of the camera because some times that button moves by mistake and causes the screen to be vibrating too often.All in all I love my monitor.",1
Great baby gift - I am a Christian and a music teacher so this super soft lamb is a great gift for me to give. Babies love the music and watching the head move.,1
"Let me start by saying i just read some of the reviews, and i will try the ""pencil trick"" to get the height adjustment correct. I will post a follow up after i do that tomorrow!My son just turned 6 months on Christmas day, and is in the 97th percentile for height... meaning if you take 100 babies his age, he is taller than 97 of them! He is VERY TALL and in 9/12 month clothing, but hes skinny so he needs like a 3/6 waist lol. Anyways, He doesn't even come close to touching the floor in this thing on the lowest setting! It is ridiculous. The seat pushes his legs like in a sitting position also... so i will also do what the pencil person reviewed and try taping it back at the tag to make him stand. If i purchased this myself i would BRING IT BACK and get a different one, but considering this was a baptism present from my sister in law i will do what needs to be done to make it work. The box states its for 4+ months... which is crap. It would be if it was lower to the ground!Other than that, he LOVES the toys on it, and i don't find the music to be too loud.. its loud yes, but he has other toys that are way louder on their lowest setting.The trays slide out and back in and its nice, because he cant just slide them himself... there's a clip underneath that needs to be activated and then the tray needs to be pushed out at the same time, so there is no risk of him hurting himself... not yet anyways.The way it folds down for storage is awesome!!The seat backing is very nice and secure... WAY better than his bouncy seats. He cant sit up on his own yet, but in this seat he is totally secure and doesn't fall all over the place.The wheels seem to be good for their purpose... although the only time it gets rolled is when i pull or push him around the living room.Overall, its ok... they just need to adjust the damn height issue... He will be walking before he reaches the floor if i dont do any alterations!",0
"I used these for a year and a half. My son recently potty trained. They worked super well and are my fav cloth diaper option. I did end up getting more covers. All their covers are good, I like the snaps, but I like the gussets, maybe one day they will make one like that. but I ended up using this kit and purchasing a few thristies snap covers and thats all I needed! (I used disposable night diapers, but that because NOTHING worked well enough overnight. and the cloth diapers got an ammonia smell that was horrible in any cloth diaper. That said, I used these every day all day and during naps. simple to use, never had repelling issues, and I have known several people that have used these and I have yet to hear a complaint.! their customer service was also super amazing and helpful!",1
My son started playing with this when he was around two-months-old and still enjoys playing with it at six-months-old.  His favorite attachment is the plush frog.  He will play with the other toys for short periods of time but quickly gets bored with them.  All of the toys are easily detachable so you can switch them out for other toys.  We switch the toys quite frequently to keep my son interested in this play gym.The mat portion of this is fairly thin and does not have a lot of cushioning.  It's therefore best to use this on a carpeted floor or on top of a foam play mat.The leaves on the mat can be lifted up of the mat.  They make a crinkling sound when you touch them.,1
I fell in love with this bag online and decided I must have it. I really wish I would have checked it out in person because it really isn't a practical bag for everyday use. It is heavy and awkward to hold on your shoulder. The body of it is stiff and doesn't curve with your body at all so it sticks out really far not good for tight or crowded areas. The only way that it has worked for me is as a changing station while traveling. I can stuff 16-18 cloth diapers into it with a wipes case and some diaper cream and it stays nice and neat in the car because it holds everything tightly together. I have used it a couple of times. One of those times I had it at a friends house and her cat sprayed it (gross) So I submerged it into water and washed it thoroughly. The water got trapped between the canvas and the cotton and I had to wring it out which warped and ruined the pattern on the front of it. Being able to wipe it down is cool but don't attempt to thoroughly wash this bag. I would prefer a bag that can be submerged in water in case of contact with bad things. The opening is small and after having a baby for a little while you realize that you really need to be able to open your baby essentials bag widely enough to view all of the contents. This bag is a bit pricey for an occasional use item. It hangs on a hook in my babies room and makes me a little sad. You already have a lot to carry with a baby so the bag should be light and smooth-laying upon the shoulder...,0
"This fit my Peg Perego 60/40 stroller.  I can keep the top zipped up so that the PP60/40 wheels stick out, or I can unzip the top which allows me to entirely cover the PP60/40.  I'll probably do the latter for the gate check, since airlines are notoriously poor at handling strollers.  The bag seems quite sturdy, so I'm sure it'll survive the trips we need to take.",1
the few notes this thing makes over and over and over will have you crawling up the wall real quick.,0
"I like this crib sheet, but the color isn't as pictured. The color is more of a true orange - not the light, creamy tangerine as pictured. It is well made and washes up great - just know it is not the color as pictured.",0
I bought this as a gift for a 6month old. She is now 2 years old and still loves this turtle.  A great gift for any little one.,1
"At first I was really excited to use this since it sometimes takes awhile for me to go, and once I started using it BMs only took about 5 or so minutes.  But then I ended up getting 2 hemmerhoids...not sure if this was just a coincidence but I've stopped using it because of this.  Oh yeah, also it makes my legs fall asleep sometimes (I'm 5'3&#34; with short legs)",0
"We must have gotten one of the last ones for the low price of $99.98, and I'm glad we snagged it because shortly after, the price shot up to $298.98, although another seller through Amazon has it for $179.95.This monitor has had very good reviews here, and it does what it's supposed to do as others have said. The picture quality is OK, but it's a bit wonky when you have the Auto Night Mode on which it is by default, as it sometimes tries to transition back and forth too much depending on how much light there is. Audio is loud enough, but tinny. The VOX mode conservers battery life by disabling the speaker when no noise is being made, and then having the monitor go into sleep mode when there is no noise for a few minutes. It then comes back on when there is some noise detected. Range is fine, as we can have the camera and the monitor at opposite ends of our house. I did not experience any interference with other devices. It is supposed to offer privacy encryption to prevent other people from picking up your signal and seeing your baby, but I had no way that I know of to prove or test that. As for build, it's made of very light plastic, which might feel a bit cheap as others have stated.The support seems very good when I had questions about the battery life. With VOX active which it is by default, the battery fully charged can last around 9 hours. With VOX off and the monitor always on, the battery fully charged lasts between 3-4 hours. It is recommended to keep the monitor plugged in with the AC adapter for prolonged monitoring, like using it overnight, so that it doesn't shut off on you from low charge.It's definitely a good deal at the $100 price point, but at the higher price points which it is now at, for it to be worth it, it would have to offer better audio and video, maybe a bigger screen, and be built of better material so that it doesn't have the ""cheapy"" feeling.",1
"I purchased this chair on the recommendation of a friend who also has this model.  Because there are no slats and the chair is a solid piece, this high chair is super easy to clean.  I had been warned by other friends with small children about slatted high chairs being impossible to clean.  Fortunately, the Boon chair is incredibly easy to keep clean.  The removable tray covers fit easily in the dishwasher.  The straps are removable and washable, as well.  (I keep the straps out most of the time, though)  My daughter is content to sit in this chair while I make dinner, as the orange cushion is comfortable.  It maneuvers easily in multiple directions.  There was some assembly required, but I put the chair together in about 10 minutes (it came in about 3 different parts).  Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. Its a bit more costly than alot of high chairs out there, but the time I save in cleaning up after my daughter the higher price is well worth it.",1
Trying to get my toddler used to the potty and she is obsessed with Abby and Sesame Street so this was a natural choice! Easy for her to get on and off and she LOVES the flushing feature!,1
"So, I now have the smallest Bjorn potty and this one. I originally ordered this one because the inside comes out and I thought that was a MUST HAVE on a potty until I tried the smaller version. It showed me that with a well-designed potty, it doesn't matter. This seems much more comfortable and natural for my third daughter than the Fisher Price Royal Flush potty did for my older two (although it was still a good potty, this has been my favorite so far). My 3 year old can use it in an emergency (and my 5 year old did once, too) since we only have one toilet (my older two potty learned long ago, this is for my 8 month old, who does elimination communication--she HATES diapers). It's easy to clean (although now I almost wish I hadn't chosen white--I thought it would help her associate the real toilet with her potty, not that that was a problem with my older two, but it shows dirt SO easily!), not too big for her and not too small for her sisters, seems comfortable enough and serves its purpose nicely.",1
LOVE this potty. When my son has to go #2 when we're out the very idea of dragging my 1 year old daughter and and my son into some random bathroom makes my head explode. Instead I move the passenger front seat all the way forward and set this up on the floor of the back seat. Just roll down the windows and the whole family can hang out in the comfort of the car. Thank God for this potty.NOTE FOR BOYS: you must get your son to carefully tuck his you know what under the rim of the seat after he sits down or you will have pee everywhere. Sounds like a pain but no big deal for us.,1
"My son LOVES these &#34;binkies&#34; as they are same ones they give you at the hospital.  He's 2.5 and still loves them and we've bought a bunch of different wubbs.  They go in the washing machine and are very sturdy.  A little pricey, but for all the use, they are worth it.",1
"My son loves his pajamas with feet, and I didn't have time to go to a store to get some for him for Christmas.  These made Christmas Eve fun for kids.  I would recommend these to anybody.  They are warm and fuzzy.",1
"I have a City Select and wanted a bassinet for my baby to lay flat in because he hates sleeping in the stroller seat.  I ordered the Deluxe Pram and then ordered this bassinet to compare the two.  I would recommend getting this bassinet if you have twins and need to have two bassinets on the City Select at one time.  However, after seeing the luxury of the Deluxe Pram, and having to go through converting my second stroller seat into this bassinet, I am returning this bassinet and keeping the deluxe pram.This bassinet has a flimsy mattress with cheap fabric cover.  The outer fabric is really nice, but the inside is what your baby will be sleeping on and touching, and I didn't think it lived up to the luxury I expect from Baby Jogger.  Also, it's not the hardest thing I've ever done, but seriously, for one hundred dollars on top of the hundreds I've already paid for the stroller, why should I have to disassemble and reassemble the seat/bassinet?!I added my pictures of comparing the Deluxe Pram in Teal to this City Select Bassinet in teal to the site here.  I just hope my pictures and comments can save someone all the trouble I've gone to in order to actually know the differences and make an informed decision about the bassinet they want :)",0
"to the other comparable activity bath toy by Yookidoo (sp?). My 13 month old prefers this over his other bath toys. 4 stars because the photo is inaccurate, the colors are different with ours but it's no big deal!",1
"We got this stroller as somewhat of a gift from someone who'd used it before. As a hand-me-down, I didn't expect much initially. I didn't bother push it around for a while, but eventually curiosity got the best of me. My first thought; this stroller is hands down, the easiest stroller to push around that I've ever used. In fairness, I'm comparing this to a clumsy car seat compatible stroller, a sit and stand stroller, and a slightly above average umbrella stroller... That's where I'm building my viewpoints from. Compared to any of the strollers I've pushed, this is much easier to control & push. I can maneuver my now 2 year old, who is nearly 30 lbs with ease, single-handed. If you hit a big, sharp turn, it might call for a second hand, but seldom do I need to. We've got another little one also. 1I used to have to use 2 hands all the time to push her around, but not anymore. That means I can help with the second kid, hold a bag momentarily, etc. It's somewhat liberating to be honest.When we searched for strollers & decided to get an umbrella stroller, we tried some higher end strollers in the $100 range or so (not really high end, but higher end than a true umbrella stroller) & nothing steered this easily. That said, I think for the price, it's really pretty fair given the maneuverability of this stroller. Can you find something else that steers this well, but is cheaper? Don't know. I couldn't, but I don't have access to try them all. I know this one works. I know it's better than others we tried for not a whole lot less money, so in my book, it's a total winner.There are a couple of negative things to note, but just nothing I felt worthy of docking a star. First off - it's not the easiest thing to fold/unfold. It's not that bad though. I did it, under a minute, no instructions; first time I tried. It's pretty simple, but it's got a slight learning curve. Let's be honest though; most of these things do. Once it's folded, it's nice and compact, and most importantly, it's small. Second, no cup holder... That's almost worth a star, but it's just not that big of a deal to me. I think a cup holder would honestly get in the way of how this thing folds.Overall though, I think this stroller brings a lot of value. Okay, it's not a $900 stroller. It's also not a $60 umbrella stroller. It pushes and controls nicely & easily. It folds down small & takes up very little space. It works just fine for me!",1
"I bought this diaper because our OverNite Disposable Diapers were still leaking and baby boy was waking up cold and wet :o(. We tried doubling up the disposables and that didn't work. Finally a Friend tipped me off to buying a diaper like this to cover over the disposable and it works! Early this AM baby boy took a big poo in his disposable which leaked over onto the Fuzzy Bunz and I was extremely impressed how well and easily the Poo washed off the extremely super soft, fuzzy FuzzyBunz. Wow! Also, even with the double up baby boy  seems comfortable in this diaper. The adjustments are very good.",1
My son loves the monkey toy so much!  It makes a cute noise when you shake him.  The book is great too. It has flaps to pull down and count the baby animals.  I love this brand too.  Everything is so well made.  It is also a great price for the toy and the book together.,1
"I like the design of this sleepsack and it is cotton. but I have to agree one of reviews: this sleepsack is too light-weight, it defeats the purpose of keeping your baby warm---which is why you purchase a sleepsack.I would not recommend this cotton blankets to others..unless you wish to use it in summer.a friend recommend BABY IN A BAG sleepsack, it has summer and winter models. I did not purchase it yet, but like to provide a link here in case you want a sleepsack situable in winter and made of cotton.[...]",0
I have used these for my youngest two children...they are so wonderful for basic closet organization!This is a standard baby shower gift...I now have a small business sewing clothing for children and use these for my inventory and my displays...they are a MUST have.,1
I love that these are really spill proof. I would recommend these to anyone with a toddler. I do wish that they had more character to choose from.,1
Loved this item. We used it to carry on the plane but than was told we couldn't use the booster seat on the plane. So on the plane ride home. We checked it in with luggage. Loved that we had a case for the booster seat.,1
These snack cups are just what every toddler needs.  They can easily get the snack out without spilling the contents if tipped over.,1
"I got this as a baby shower gift for my sister in law! We had one of these with our daughter when she was a baby and it really made her sleep all around better! I think they should hand these out at the hospital when you have a baby!! It has been a life saver! Now that she's 3 we used it to get her to sleep all night in her room. She used to wake up around 3-4am n come to our bed but not anymore! We just turn on the rain n she's out all night somehow! I guess it relaxes her when she first falls asleep so she gets a better nights sleep? Idk and I don't care how it works, I love it!!! Also she usually falls asleep within around 15mins after turning it on!",1
"Easy to install, easy to use, very stylish. Love the design. We bought one for each car! Would definitely recommend!",1
Very cute potty chair. Bought it for my new grand daughter. She won't be needing it for a while but I thought it was so cute.,1
"I liked this, but as my son started to grab and tug, this was really easy to pull off.  I prefer the Ulubulu brand clips, because they're a firmer hold.",1
"I love that you can pump, freeze and feed all from the same liner.  You have to buy the Playtex pump adapter kit to be able to do that but I think its still much cheaper than using milk storage bags.  Clean up couldn't be easier either, just throw it away.  That feature is great when traveling as well. You don't have to worry about your bottles not being clean because you use a fresh liner and the milk stays there until baby gets it, not getting transferred around from bottle to bag to bottle again.  I also liked that the liner was able to collapse on itself and didn't for a vacuum for baby to fight against like some bottles do.  I did have a few issues with the bottles leaking if they weren't screwed on just right but I think that happens if any bottle isn't screwed on right.  Bottom line is my Huband and I loved the Playtex system for breastmilk feeding/storage and we still use it now that we switched to formula at 9 months.",1
Bought this  small acrylic  plaque as an &#34;extra&#34; for a baby shower gift basket that I was devising for my lovely but overworked daughter in law. She's a physician that seldom gets a moment to herself. There were many lovely baby girl things given to her  at the shower but she said she loved the plaque for her future &#34;bride to be&#34; daughter. She felt the little keepsake was unique and thoughtful . Plaque photos are  accurate and dimensions are provided . It also comes in a little white netted sack .,1
Based on the other reviews here I bought this product and had it shipped ahead to my travel destination. We arrived with our 5 month old really late at night and I hoped that this crib would live up to its promise of quick setup in minutes. This crib did not disappoint! I had my baby down in her crib less than 10 minutes after we arrived. I even paid to have it brought back with us as an extra piece of luggage on the airplane. I will always travel with this crib!,1
"Description said it was for a 48&#34; window. As pictured nicely ruffled, it does not work for 48&#34;. As a strait smooth panel it works for a 48&#34; window. To get nice ruffles, you need two panels.",0
I  think it could have been made a little better. It is not exactly what I thought it would be like. I didn't read any of the reviews until after I bought it otherwise i might have looked for something else. I think my daughter will be happy with it though.,0
Purchased this for Christmas for my 23-month-old who is very hands-on and loves to build. I looked at many sets before deciding on Uncle Goose and the ultimate deciding factor was that this one had animal pictures as well as numbers. I can see it was a good choice as my son loves to point out the animals as he is building. This will be a treasured toy!,1
"Easy to install, very sturdy. I put it in myself in 5 minutes and it works great. Have to slide button and lift up to open it so kids and dogs haven't figured it out.",1
I use all Avent products and really like them. The pacifiers have held up to multiple washes and constant gnawing from a one toothed 8 month old. Water does get inside the nipple when submerged in water and has to be shaken out. The inside does get a little cloudy over time so I replace them after about 6 months.,1
"This is a nice design with support for the baby's head and the strap to hold the pillow in place. It's not the best quality though with a piece of foam and a rather thin quality cover. Took many washes to get the smell off the pillow. The price is a scam though, which has a wide range ($20 - $40) depending on the cover! Watch out for it. I don't think it's worth 20 either, but oh well.",0
"After spending a lot of money replacing chewed up or non-spill proof spill proof cups, this cup was a God send. Well worth the money.",1
"Looks good, but I hope you have a personal grocery shopper! There are no notches on the bottom of the car seat so the seat does not sit on top of the grocery cart. Try doing a week's worth of shopping with a huge car seat in the main part of the buggy! Good luck!",0
"This is an awesome carrier that hardley takes up space. About the size of a small bag of chips. We use this for our 16 month old daughter that weighs 22lbs. Not the most comfortable thing for the shoulders but it's designed to be lightweight not super comfortable. I wouldn't say it's uncomfortable, just not perfect. We love it.",1
These plates clean up well either in the dishwasher or by hand with soap and water.  They are sturdy and have survived many drops and flings on a tile floor.  My grandchildren like the colors.,1
I appreciate having organic products for my first son and this mattress pad fits the Naturepedic Waterproof Flat Cradle Pad perfectly.,1
"My 4 month old loves the little butterfly! The other toys don't really interest her as much but thats not to say that they aren't good quality toys. But I think its a great buy! It helped me alot in trying to get her to reach and grab on to objects. And if u put the butterfly in the freezer (the wings have liquid in them) it is great as a first teething toy! My daughter doesnt have teeth yet but she loves to put stuff in her mouth and there is a wonderful texture difference between the top and bottom wings. I have no regrets about buying this, it was a great price for quality products! The only thing I would change is that the little TV remote toy has three sets of matching buttons, and each of the matching buttons make the same sound. So instead of getting 8 different sounds you only get 5. And since the sounds are really short I think it would have been nice to get more sounds to try to catch a babys interest. But had I known the sounds it wouldn't have been a deal breaker.",1
"This has really helped with all the toy dropping.  I'm not saying my 19 month old still doesn't throw her toys in floor board, but this does help.  I can also put snacks on it.  Cleans very easy.  Nice that it's a tray that is still safe just in case of a car accident (God forbid).  I would definitely purchase this again!",1
Was a gift to my sister in Fl. She loved it. She commented on how much i must have spent.,1
"This is perfect for my 2 month old son.  It was easy to put together, and folds up nicely.  It can go slow and fast.  I read on someones review that it plays music- is DOES NOT.  Not a deal breaker for me I don't mind if it doesn't play music.  It does seem to go through battery's pretty quick- it takes 4 c battery's and we already need to change them after 2 weeks.  For the price ( $65) I am happy with my purchase and so is my baby. :)",1
"This is a really great basic car seat.  It's nice and roomy, easy to install, and great quality. I was surprised by how affordable it was!",1
I use these in the diaper bag and in the house.  They work better than a diaper pail because the smell is contained and you don't build up an entire diaper pail of smelly diapers.  The cost per use is also very close to the Diaper Genie.,1
"The product I like, has good quality and the price convinced me.I would buy again if I need. thanks",1
Good forks. My kid likes the metal ones.. Only wish the handles had some curves in them to accommodate their small hands but overall I like them and so does he.,1
"The previous reviewer was a bit harsh on this product. Maybe it doesn't work with colicky babies, but my son didn't have colic and he really enjoyed the sounds. My only negative was that the sound shut off too quickly. 5 minutes at the most. To be truly effective, it needs to play longer. It also successfully lulled my husband and I back to sleep when my son was in his bassinet in our room, so that's an added bonus! It's definitely not something to make high priority, but if you get it as a gift or can borrow on, I would definitely recommend it. Oh and by the way, ALL of the techniques shown in Happiest Baby on the Block work like a charm. Maybe not on colicky babies though...",1
my nephew loves the thing.  He holds onto it and is able to keep it in his mouth much easier.,1
"very easy to put together, and the color is perfect. A little smaller than i thought, but still large enough to fit large baskets underneath, or a large box of diapers.",1
"I recently bought this and recieved it today in the mail. Their service was very fast, but the produst just wasn't what I had expected. It looks very faded and the fairy's aren't very cute at all. (The fairy's hands on the blanket look like a male body part.)I do not recomend this product, the pictures are wayyyyy cuter than it really is. (sorry)",0
I has bought this item and after 4 months I get video in the parent unit but no audio. I'm trying to contact Motorola without success.,0
I was grateful to recieve this product.  I can now get my granddaughter out of her car seat.  Thank you.,1
My 8 month old son will occassionally pick up the toy to use the ring as a teether but he does not care too much for the pictures.  I wouldn't buy it for my next child but it was as I expected.  Jacob may enjoy it more as he gets older.,0
"This is by far my Best purchase so far for my current 2 month old.The first time i tried playing the music and holding it in front of her was at 2 weeks. Then she had not much of a response. However, at 5 weeks, she stares at it. When I need to calm her down, I press the buttons one by one after each tune is completed. She never seems to get tired of it. I simply cannot wait till the day she learns how to hold it and press the buttons by herself. A Terrific buy!!",1
"We bought this for our kitchen sink so our toddler could wash her hands, and it works great!  Over time, it does tend to work its way up the faucet (towards the back of the sink) for some reason, which shortens its &#34;extension&#34;, but it's very easy to pull it back into position.  We take it off pretty often to facilitate doing the dishes, and it's easy to take on/off.  Note that the water will have some momentum as it flows through this (especially if coming from a higher flow kitchen faucet), so the water sort of shoots off the end and actually gets extended past the edge of the plastic extender.  This is great because otherwise, the water would still be too far away for our daughter to reach.  However, if you have a very small sink, it might be a problem.",1
"cute bib I bought for my daughter's 1 st birthday. While it is completely adorable for pictures, take it off before she eats her cake if you don't want it to get detsroyed.",1
"We purchased two umbrella strollers for our twins as ""emergency stroller"", and we got those connectors as well, of course.I can only say that it has saved our lives many times. One time (3 years ago), our main stroller was broken, and we had to wait for the replacement. Since we did not want to spend a lot of money, this was the option we chose.The connectors are cheap, and still extremely good. We have used them for over 3 years now, and even when they fell apart once, they still got back together with no effort and it still works all in all. The middle wheels of the strollers get stuck sometime, since they are apparently too close together. But, I figured my way out and I am very happy with this.We traveled overseas with the twins when they were 3 1/2 years of age. I was so uncertain whether to take a stroller or not, that still fits into the car after arrival at the new place. I thought ""alright, let's take the buggies. if something breaks or falls apart, it won't hurt."" It turned out all well and fine, and the stroller extremely necessary for the unexpected things happening at airports. We had to walk long ways, incl move of Gate at the last minute to the other side of the airport.Although I write a lot not too important for the connectors, I still hope to give some advice, especially twin parents. Even if not used as emergency stroller, this option can be used on a daily basis for shorter slow strolls.Super invention, and I am glad that there is something out there that allows low-income families to ""survive"". Great invention of our times!",1
"I purchased this gate several months ago to keep my twins in the front room.  Yeah, it does it's job, and they stay in the room.  However, when the extension pieces are used it becomes very wobbly, and after a few weeks it became difficult to lock.  Also, it's somewhat unattractive, and easily stained.",0
"These work great for baby food purees.  You really can just ""pop"" the cubes out if you want.  Neat idea and very useful.  I would buy them again.  I do find that the ice cube trays are a little more practical though.  Only because I can make more ahead of time and once frozen, put them in to baggies.",1
This is a great product and can afford you much peace of mind but:1) Never rely totally on any device to monitor your baby. Always use it as a supplement.2) You MUST make sure it is on snugly as the instructions direct or it will not work at all.It is probably not very useful if your baby is rolling around at night but it is great for newborns and infants who don't move much.,1
"Used for barely a month and found that pump motor became very noisy after 2 weeks of constant use. Not sure if it's because the motor is meant to be used in the USA, and I'm based in Singapore. I find the system rather clumsy. The wires joining the motor to the pump are entangled and this causes the bottles (when fitted into the pump) to topple easily. So far, I've only used it at home, so not sure how it'll work out once I have to use it at work. Suction is also not as good as manual pump (I had an Avent manual pump before I bought this). Other than that, it's pretty decent as my milk supply did increase steadily and it takes me half the time to express my milk, as compared to when I was using a manual pump.Can consider buying if you're using Avent products currently, e.g. steriliser, bottles, etc. and if you're living in USA. I'm rather disappointed that I can't do a 1-to-1 exchange from the Singapore office. If there's any malfunction with the product, I have to send it back to the USA as the warranty is not an international one. Need to weigh the pros and cons between getting it cheap from Amazon.com and after sales service.",0
"I LOVE this stroller. I searched far and wide for the perfect stroller for my needs and this one fits the bill. I chose this one specifically for the spinning feature. I wanted to be able to have my baby face me even when she is out of the carrier. My baby has a club foot that requires casting and I didn't want nosy people asking 20 questions about what ""happened"" to her. I've enjoyed showing people the cool features of this stroller and their ease in use. Breaking it down is relatively easy as well. The only cons I can come up with is the basket is average sized, but the support bars block access to it for larger items. Putting this stroller together was pretty easy, it steers like a dream, and I get compliments everywhere we go. I'd definitely recommend this stroller.",1
"I purchased this dustpan to put next to my litterbox to sweep up stray bits of litter. Unfortunately, this does not do a good job. The bristles are too soft and it's really ineffective. I also wish the silicone edge were a bit firmer as the contents are very easily to spill out.  Sure, it's cute, the colors are appealing and the brush fits snugly into the pan, but it just doesn't seem practical.",0
I haven't used it yet. But it looks very good. I tried it on my 2010 Toyota Corolla. It works well. I am satisfied with it.,1
"We have been making baby food for about 4 months now, and this tray has been everything we hoped it would be.  After all, it's essentially an ice cube tray with a lid.  No, it is not a long-term storage container because the lid does not seal tightly. If I leave cubes in there more than a week, I will see freezer burn.  Since I cook ahead on weekends, I usually freeze food in the trays and then pop them into a freezer bag.  I mix and match foods all week, so I prefer to have several different foods at the ready.  I find that one tray holds four small-medium apples or pears perfectly.  A medium butternut squash is a little too large to fit all in one tray.  To handle the overflow, we also have some freezer pots that we use, but truth be told I prefer the tray because the 1-oz portions are perfect for mixing different foods (and now that my daughter is 9 months old we had to get a second tray).  In the morning I just pop a few cubes into a larger container, and they are thawed by the time she needs to eat at school.  Great for a working mom who wants to provide home-cooked food!Tip - sometimes the cubes do ""stick"" in the tray, so I use a chopstick to push on one end and they pop out perfectly.  The chopstick doesn't damage the tray - works great for me!",1
The shipping is super fast. I found this mattress to be perfect and you can't beat the price. Oh and it isn't made with those coils its like a temperpedic material.,1
We have this for an outside door but i'm going to try something else.  Firstly we had friends over and their teenage kids easily broke this by just pushing the door handle hard before they realised to unlock it.  Secondly - you have to remember to lock it - may as well just put a really high normal lock for a couple of bucks on the door and save the money.,0
"The main compartment in this bag is pretty small and makes for not much organization. For $65 I thought this bag would be much bigger. One other downfall was after only a few washes of the changing pad, it started falling apart. The last thing I dislike is that the skulls are just stamped on the bag rather poorly. They should have been stitched.I do like that it comes with many compartments and three big pockets in the front! The skulls are also kind of fun and my man isn't embarassed to carry it around. The over the shoulder strap is super comfortable!",0
The perfect security blanket for any infant.  It is soft and small enough to feel safe leaving in the crib.  My son loves his Robot blankie and sleeps with it always.,1
Really not big enough to get an average size hand through the loop - which sort of defeats the purpose of the item.,0
"We love this chair its one of the best items we have bought! Easy to fold up i can do it with one hand and it takes about two sec.!  It folds up so easy and flat that we never bought a portable high chair. Theres no need to because, the chairs height is adjustable so that you can take the tray off and it will fit at any table.",1
"We bought this blanket for our son, it is absolutely beautiful! Our son (8 weeks) just loves to grab at the satin. He holds it when we tuck him in for bed. It's great for any temperature. We live in Las Vegas and we are able to use it now in the summer. We strongly reccomend this item!",1
"This product has held up very well to not only our daughter's chewing but also to a couple of washings.  We don't dry it at all, but it came out great after washing it! :)",1
"A great size for car seat, crib, stroller and very easy to move from one to the others. A great value and purchase.",1
"My baby had  huge problem of  stuck burps, I used medella, dr brown's bottle, but these were the best. highly recommended.",1
"My guy is so tiny, we used this as his highchair until he was nearly 9 months old. Though he could peel off the tray cover and toss it pretty easily.",1
"I ordered this for my daughter when she was just starting to sit up as it is perfect for new sitters. Because of its shape it can fit between their legs and it is sturdy enough that they can prop themselves by holding on with one hand and can explore the toy with the other. (I am an early childhood special educator so I am always on the lookout for toys for particular developmental stages!) In fact by the time this arrived, my daughter didn't really need anything to hold onto, but she does love this toy. We've had it for about 3 months now, since she was 5 months old, and it still keeps her entertained for a long time. Very well designed.",1
"We had craft day with our new grandson and this was perfect, his parents absolutly loved it. I will do it again with our next grandchild.",1
"My neice may only be 3 months old, but this musical toy gets her attention and she smiles and laughs out!  It's perfect",1
I have other Summer Infant SwaddleMe's and they are great. These particular ones are too stretchy though and baby breaks out of the swaddle and wakes himself up :(,0
This is simply the cutest &#34;backpack&#34; style harness ever! I was looking to try this out on my &#34;almost 3 year old&#34; daughter and was not sure how it would go over with her... but she loves it! Plus what I liked is that is was not as &#34;babyish looking&#34; as many of the other backpack style harnesses I saw. This looked appropriate for a little girl! Love love it!,1
My 5 month old still LOVES this swing.  We've been using it since he was 3 weeks old.  When he was smaller he often fell asleep in it..he now likes to pull the toys and watch the lights.  I really don't understand the other negative reviews.  It really sounds like they are not using it properly.,1
"Helps us not destroy the entire table when we are eating out, plus it is more sanitary than putting food on a table.",1
"We purchased this car seat because of the grade that Consumer Reports gave it. It was listed as the &#34;best buy&#34; in its class. My daughter really likes this car seat and it appears to be very safe, I pray we never have to find out. There are two things that I do not love about this seat. One, it is rather big. I have an SUV so it is not an issue but I can see how it could be in a compact car. That really shouldn't be a determining factor because safety out weighs convenience. The other is that when my child is in this car seat she is very much reclined, she isn't in an upright position and it would be hard for her to get in that position. On the other hand, this is nice for when they fall asleep because she doesn't look so uncomfortable. I would recommend this product.",1
"This cup is perfect. It is small enough that they can learn to hold it up right, the handles are small and just round enugh with a great texture so messy meal time hands don't drop the cup. Easy to clean although we only use water in it, and closes with out leaking for transport. Only con is if you fill it to full you will get an unexpected splash when putting on the lid.",1
I have a 2 year old and have been using this product since he was few months old. Great product.  Great for making own baby wipe solution and spray.  Highly recommend!,1
"What a waste of money!  I feel had with the marketing gimick!  These were fine for about 8 months or so!  I purchased about 50+ because I have twins, and needed multiple bottles.  I learned that I totally wasted my money on these as they leak all over!  I am so tired of cleaning out my fridge!!!!  Do yourself a favor and purchase something else!  I am personally throwing ALL of them in the trash and starting over with something else, maybe Dr. Browns.  I am expecting again in a few months and don't need the extra aggravation of the mess to clean up and the assembly.Hope this will be useful to those contemplating these bottles.",0
"I really like these. I have been using these to convert my daughter's Avent 4 oz bottles to sippy cups. Perfect inexpensive accessory to save on the price of sippys. She is 11 months and has been using them since she was 6 months. I would have given them a 5 star rating if I could pick the colors. I got two green ones, which is fine, just wish I had a choice!",1
"I reviewed just about every umbrella stroller I could find online and shared my findings with a friend. I had decided this was the best stroller available, and my friend actually purchased it before I did.  I loved being able to see her's in person before ordering one for myself.  It's a wonderful stroller!  It folds/unfolds easy, offers great padding/support, allows my son (9-months) to recline or sit up straight and has ample storage for me!  I bought this stroller to take on vacations and loved it so much I keep it in my car now instead of our larger travel system stroller.  The wheels turn great and the handles are tall, so I never once felt like I was stooped over or kicking the bottom of the stroller.  The sun shade is very sturdy, covers my son's head well and is detachable.  I am glad I spent the money on this stroller and did not settle for a $15-$25 variety that doesn't offer any real support.",1
"I love love love this stroller, let me count the ways:1. Super light weight for a fully featured stroller!2. REALLY compact fold, heck it fits into my scion xb trunk which is how I found this stroller in the first place. Saves me such precious cargo space.3. Stylish - it is one of a kind!4. SUPER easy fold but requires two hands.5. HUGE storage basket that you can actually use.6. Adjustable footrest and the back EASILY reclines.7. Smooth ride with ONE hand. Yes, I could not believe it. Those skateboarding wheels are the trick.8. Comfy - she loves it and that's huge!9. Magnetic peakaboo window!10. Ships with mosquito net and rain cover!The ways that I could love thee more:1. Seat folds outwards so I always have the wheels of my stroller facing out in my car so it doesn't get the seat dirty.2. Canopy not huge but you can buy an extender or an attachable umbrella that can basically follow the sun and give coverage at any angle.3. No cupholder included (cmon!!!) but you can buy one as an accessory.I also own a first ignite umbrella stroller (too long for my XB. I have to get everything out before i can use it). We also own an orbit stroller that I love but once again takes out too much space in this car's trunk, so we leave it in the other car. Another huge downside of the orbit is that you have to remove the seat before you can close the stroller. So yes, good question, where do you put the seat while you fold the stroller?? Lastly, we have a hand-me-down BOB revolution that is fantastic when we go on the trailer but when that beast gets into our trunk, nothing else does. So it pretty much stays in the garage. Babyhome emotion is my everyday stroller.",1
"I bought this pump after having used the Avent Isis. I went to full expression for my baby and ended up spending several hours on the pump everyday, so getting an electric was clearly a must!This pump works, and you don't end up with sore muscles as with the Avent Isis. At the same time, I am not convinced it is as efficient as the Avent Isis... The good point is that I have one hand free when using this pump, which I did not have with the Isis. The bad point is that I probably spend a bit more time with this one than I would need with a better pump. And it is REALLY loud, so there is no way I can watch a DVD while expressing.As I plan to carry on to express several times per day, I am getting a Medela pump in style, everybody says it's a great pump, and the double pumping will no doubt save me time.",0
"Not dependable.  We are probably on our fifth one that we've returned and replaced.  We've only kept getting it as we were stuck with it from a registry and didn't want to fork out more money for a different one. Our issues: lots of static, constantly flaking out between the red warning light (off) and being on, one parent monitor went completely dead although it ""looked"" ok with the green light, and overall, just sporadic use.  Many evenings we'd sit and turn it on and off every few minutes just to make sure the baby was ok, otherwise if left on long term, it would beep with the red light which meant it wasn't working.On the good side, it does have a long range.Overall, don't buy unless you want a unit that you'll have to return or one that will flake out on you within a couple months.",0
"I LOVE these diaper covers. They are easy to use, easy to clean, and are adorable! They fit my babies great, and I can't wait to use them again on the next one! I don't think they are half as bulky as some of the other diaper covers, especially the ones with inserts.(We use them with prefolds and Snappis).",1
"These are great bottles. I wanted to use glass bottles and thought I would be faced with only the """"old skool"""" ones without any vent system. These work well and keep gas out of the baby. I just don't like cleaning all of the parts :)",1
Bought this for a friend who loves Hello Kitty things and she loves it!  It writes very well and is a really cute pen.,1
I am very pleased with the quality of this long sleeve T. It fits my son perfectly. I will be buying another once he grows out of this one.,1
"This clip is very strong. It is the only one that I have found that doesn't loosen with time and my son cannot pull off. It's really &#34;pretty&#34;, too!",1
"My father had made my daughter a potty, but it had the pot that slid from behind under the seat.  So there were little spills from time to time.  I bought this potty and my daughter loves it!!  It's so easy for her to pick up and flush and there is never a mess.  Definitely worth every penny!",1
"This a perfect gate for a 52"" wide opening. It was easy to assemble and keeps my beagle in her zone in the kitchen. I am not sure if it can handle larger dogs, since it seems it is not made of strong metal.",1
"We've used this quite a few times at public park restrooms (that look like they were last cleaned in 1988) and while were traveling with our small child. It's very simple to use - you literally unfold the folding potty seat and sit the seat on top of the toilet seat. That way your child's bottom is touching the folding seat and not the gross toilet. The handles on the sides are a godsend because then they're holding onto the seat rather than touching the toilet.I used to keep it in my diaper bag or backpack in a clean grocery bag. Once it got used, I put it back into the grocery bag and when I got home I wiped it down with Clorox or Lysol wipes on both sides and then put it into a NEW bag so it was ready to use again.Despite your best efforts, at least they will be able to go to the bathroom in a clean manner. However, if your child is like mine I pretty much guarantee they will still touch the floor of the restroom, the door, look under the stall at the next person, and get a dubious amount of soap on their hands while washing them. :-). Hey, at least we try to keep them healthy.",1
"in order for this to work, you have to use a high flavored drink such as poweraide - also found that medicine is to thick to go through the sippy holes, so after getting the correct ounce in the mini measuring cup you then need to also add the same flavored drink into that cup as well to thin it out and dilute flavor. The cup leaks without the mini measuring cup connected to it. The cup doesn't work as it specifies on its own you have to do these things to get it to work right, and its a hit or miss with a child so you find your self testing the sippy cup before giving it to them to see if you got the flavor levels right. Kind of a pain in the...",0
"I bought about 200sq ft of these tiles. I rent my house, so putting carpet in was something that I couldn't do. My whole house is tile, so this was a good solution. My 9month old sits, stands and falls down on these all day long and doesn't get hurt. The price of these online is expensive. I bought these for $20 a pk at a K-Mart. (I live in HI so everything costs more)",1
"Unfortunately this product does not work. Atleast with our bath tub. It doesn't create a tight seal and water squirts out everywhere from the part that supposed to seal it to the faucet in our bathtub and it makes our shower turn on because of the pressure. So, I would not recommend this item. It may work better if used on a faucet where you can control the pressure of the water, but our faucet controls hot and cold through one knob so the pressure has to be high to get warm water, where as it may work better if you have seperate knobs for hot and cold and can control the pressure.",0
"I like the fabric of this, and it is easy to use, BUT, it doesn't work on many carts.Also, there is not enough fabric on the FRONT of the baby.... there is a ton behind the baby, but not enough to cover the area in front of the baby, which is where it needs to be covered. I kept it, but I am still looking for an additional one.",0
"This is one awesome pillow. I was happy I picked the pricier two-sided one, as it's nice to be able to switch sleeping sides at night and not have to readjust. I am at 6 months right now, but honestly might keep sleeping with this post-delivery. I think the fill level is good - not too fluffy or thin. It does get a little warm since the fill is polyester. The cover is pretty easy to remove and put back on for washing. My husband has caught our dog taking midday naps in it. Can't blame her! I am 5'8"" and I think if I were much taller this might feel a little short. Would absolutely recommend this pillow for a winter pregnancy. For summer, I would go with something made of natural fibers that is more breathable.",1
"I love how trim the grovia diaper is with these inserts. Such a fantastic, overlooked cloth diapering option. Highly recommend!",1
It fits the changing table pad and the fabric is soft. So far I have no complaints with it. I have washed it a few times and it hasn't shrunk. The design is very cute.,1
We've had this since my son was 6 months (now almost 9). He loves it and he can spin it on his own.It suctions very well to our Ikea high chair. If you wet the bottom a little first it will stick even better. He did get his finger caught in it once or twice but he was able to pull it free quickly.,1
"I hate to think of all the germs in shopping carts.  I always used this seat cover and never let my son touch the shopping carts or restaurant high chairs.  Too bad at 26 months he is now too big for it and now sits in those germ infested car shopping carts.  Oh well.  Purchase this product and you won't be disappointed.  I washed it often and it lived in the trunk of my car.  I do have to say that I did not put it in the carry bag form because it took too long to get it that way, but it didn't matter anyway it was quicker to put it in the grocery cart when it was not in the bag form.  A great baby shower gift!",1
"This doll is cute, soft, and small.  It is a perfect size doll for newborns.  The Thermal Baby Doll for $14.95 is bigger, super soft, cuddly, very well made, and has more detail than the Eden Doll.  Had I not previously bought the Thermal Doll, I would think this is a great little doll.  Even though the price of the Eden Baby Doll in Sleeper is not bad, I feel at the big local store you could probably find a comparison for $5 which is the reason I am not as impressed with this doll purchase.",1
"Great Lamb, so sweet,  I love it. Music to sooth the Baby,  I love it.  I bought it for a soon to arrive Baby girl.",1
"It's a easy to use and light stroller.  I like the color too.  The installation was easy.  I did it in 10 minutes.  However, sometimes the harness unhooked itself.",1
"It's definitely cute, my teething baby loved it because top reminds her of nipple. However, I have to give it 4 stars because it's very sensitive to touch and squeaks to the lightest touch.",1
So disappointed. I packed this super cute elephant with snacks just after getting it as a gift. It opened up and all the fruit went everywhere! It doesn't seal. I am contacting Boon for a replacement.,0
"My son is able to climb out of pretty much anything, but his crib and this. I have gone through two highchairs and he could get out of both of them, so this was my last resort. Not only is is cute and easy to clean, but it also does the trick! I will use it as long as I can with him.",1
"I love the look of this mobile; it's super cute & matches our nursery decor, plus my twins love looking up at the animals whether they're moving or not.  Only downfall if that the length of time for rotation & movement is quite short :( I don't think it's even 5 minutes. The mobile is operated by a wind-up mechanism, so when it's done it's done.",0
"My son never used these...since he is a boy and the ones I received were pink...so I can't attest to whether he liked them or not.Maybe it's just me, but colors may vary just doesn't fly with baby stuff unless all the colors are neutral.",0
"We recently had a vacation in the Swiss Alps in the winter. It would be impossible to have the baby in his stroller, so we just took our Ergo. However, since we would be spending so much time outside, I knew that keepig baby just in his bunting would not be enough. I found this vest and it was the perfect answer. It kept baby very warm and it also kept me warm. I think that the two of us were the most comfortable of our group. It is easy to put on. I even had a few people inquire about where to get one!",1

"My son is 3 and uses this and in fact we liked it so much, we bought another one for the upstairs bathroom! It's convenient, portable, easy to dump out contents from the chamber and we just rinse out and set back in the chair. The rails help child to get on and off. I have not used on top of a toilet, I just wanted it as a potty chair or a step stool, so I cannot comment on that part. It does not tip on us. I have no problems with it whatsoever. Yes, the splash guard can fall in, but we just wash off and snap back into place and I try to teach my son to just point downward when going to the bathroom so he'll eventually not have to use it at all.",1
"I wanted to review this product after having used it for almost 2 years.  I have to say, even after that long it's still going strong!  Something I would recommend would be to only use it for poop diapers (this helps conserve the refills which can be pricey) and spraying the cavity with Lysol every time you empty out the ""diaper sausage"".  Because of the Lysol thing we don't have any phantom poop smells that a lot of people seem to be complaining about.  Overall I'm extremely pleased with this product and a friend of mine loved it so much she got one for each floor of her house.",1
i really love this set it will do a good job in my lil girls room. with this set is what im using to decorate her room its the best idea starter.,1
I also have the Medela Pump in Style electric pump that I borrowed from a friend and I find that the Avent Isis pump is much more effective. (And the Medela pump is $150+!)I am able to express more milk with the Isis pump and it is more comfortable. I do have to hand pump it but it is worth the extra effort. I tried the Medela pump for a few days straight and the milk supply that I could express began to decrease because I was unable to get all of the milk and it was not stimulating my breasts properly. I am now just using the Isis pump and I love it! It would be nice if Avent made a dual electric pump for work because I will only buy Avent products now.,1
"I have everything Luv-U-Zoo for my 7 month old and when I saw this toy, I had to have it.It was delivered two days after I ordered and my son loves it.The alligator is a hard teething toy, but it works for my son who has been teething for the past 4 months.He loves playing with it and couldn't be happier.A happy baby, is a happy mom.I am very pleased with this product.",1
This pillow was the perfect solution to supporting my growing baby bump. The back wedge is phenomenal! I can't wait to get into bed every night and nestle into this pillow that instantly relieves the weight and added pressure from my back and side.  It also keeps me on my left which I would otherwise struggle to do in my sleep! This product was so clearly designed by a mom and I will be trying other products from this line!!,1
"I recieved this for my second child and wasn't sure I really needed it.  Well, I was very wrong.  This stroller frame was a lifesaver! It is very small and lightweight and took up little room in my trunk.  It was extremely easy to get out and setup for walking around the mall or into the doctors office! Would strongly recommend this stroller frame, in fact everyone who saw it purchased one for themselves.  My husband is tall and loves that the handle adjusts to accommodate people of all heights!",1
"I received this off my registry and loved it, but have to agree with the others; it works until the real poop starts.  I have an 8 month old, and there is no containing this smell.  Even with air fresheners, Lysol, etc its awful.  It doesn't help that my springs on the trap door broke, which means it does not contain any smell.  We had to move it out into the hallway and finally I have given up and now use doggy poo bags to wrap my dirty diapers in to throw away in out outside can.  Much easier.  I really wished this would have worked because it was wonderful to just step and throw.",0
we have a wider rail in the front of the crib and this fit perfectly! Great coverage and easy to fasten.,1
"If you have a mam, get itWorks from 0 to ..well, untill they stopGet it. Way easier than having to carry 4 spare paci's",1
"I just got this gate yesterday and I am already very satisfied.  I read a lot of reviews, both positive and negative, and decided to get the gate and see for myself.  I pressure mounted it, and I feel that it is plenty strong to contain my two dogs (17 and 25 lbs) and my two year old niece.  We are moving soon and I will probably screw it into the wall at the new house, but for the next month the pressure mounts should do just fine.I chose this gate over others because my dogs, while small, can jump very high and have always been able to get over other gates.  Not this one!!!  This gate is plenty tall.  I do wish that the opening would swing in both directions because I am not used to having to step back to open it from the one side, but I will get past that because the benefits of this gate far outweigh the extra step backward that I have to take.  I also really like the locking mechanism on the swing door, because my niece is just about tall enough to reach the top of the gate, and I'm sure it won't be long before she figures out how to lift the handle to open it, but with the lock engaged she definitely won't be able to get the gate open until she is older and taller.I am very glad that the gate came with one extension, because on it's own I'm not sure that it would fit most doorways.  The extension was perfect to fit my doorway, which is a bit wider than standard.  You can get additional extensions for extra wide doorways.  I do feel like the gate loses a bit of strength where the main piece and the extension connect, but it would take a grown adult pushing on it to knock it out of place (and that is with the pressure mounts - I am sure it is much stronger when wall mounted).",1
I dropped my monitor and the antenna broke completely off. Infant Optics' customer service was nice and replaced the monitor for me. Fantastic customer service.,1
"Just received this yesterday.  My son is 4 months old and very long for his age.  He is in about the 97th percentile for his height.  His feet do not reach the base even at the lowest setting.  We use pillows, like others suggested,so he can play on it.  Also, I noticed the weight limit on this exersaucer is much higher than some others - 40 pounds as compared to 25 to 30 pounds on some much more expensive ones.",1
The crib is beautiful. Only problem is my twin boys chewed on the top of it where they hold onto in order to stand up and some wood is chipped away now. I wonder if their are inventions out there to cover that part.,1
"When I order this product it said ""Philips AVENT BPA Free Translucent Pacifier, 0-6 Months, Clear"" and when I got it, it was the 0-3 months pacifiers so I returned it and they sent me a new order and when I got them for the 2nd time, it was again the 0-3months pacifier. I just returned it again and asked for a full refund.",0
"Some stitching was coming undone, but an easy fix.  Other wise good buy!! Looking forward to putting it in my babies room.",1
"I bought this for my 6 month old son for Christmas for his stocking and I love it!!!!!  He is my third child and this is the most I have ever seen any of my children play with one single baby toy.  He loves this the most out of all his presents and it is constantly in his hand.  It is easy for him to hold, pick up, and chew on.  A must-have baby toy and I definitely wish I had this when my other kids were babies!",1
"Great product, works great.  Now when my daughter falls asleep in her car seat she has somewhere to rest her head and the straps aren't digging into her neck.  At first she was distracted by the bunnies and would try to eat them, so I turned them upside down so the bunnies are at her shoulders instead of her chest.",1
"These spoons just aren't working well for our baby.  First, they keep falling out of the small dishes we're using because the handle is so long.  Second, they have a deep dish, so starting a baby out on small bites is harder.  And lastly, when our baby has grasped this spoon herself, she's more likely to shove too much into her mouth (and down her throat) because the handle is so long.  Maybe when she's older and eats more out of a larger dish, these spoons will work, but for now, the smaller paddle shaped spoons are working much better for our 6 month old.",0
"These cups are lightweight for children, soft and durable.  Both my son and daughter have their favorite color  to use.",1
"Bought this after we found out that our Graco Snugride 35 click connect was not compatible with the City Mini GT car seat adapter. Very glad we got this. Price wise it's comparable to buying an adapter, and it is very easy to use. Car seat easily clicks into place.Console is not the roomiest.",1
"Hooks.  Connect to the stroller.  2 of them. Mount them as you will (they don't work quite as well on an umbrella stroller, mind you, but still work fine).  Use them for extra bags. Take a walk to the store, fill the basket below baby and still have room for more carrying with these. Put anything you want on them that has a handle.  Our little girl likes to get out and walk with us every so often, these make for good hand holds when your hands are needed elsewhere.All in all, very handy accessory with all sorts of uses.  Adds an extra bit of convenience to the stroller and that's handy in all sorts of ways, no doubt ways that I haven't even thought of.",1
"Works great to clean all my BornFree glass bottles and OrganicKidz Wide Neck 9 oz stainless steel baby bottles. I love this brush came with a stand, so you can put the brush to be dry on the counter not taking too much space. I sometimes use the nipple cleaner, but most of time me and my husband just use the tip of the brush to force in the tip of the nipple to brush the milk residual off.",1
"I bought this booster seat without checking the reviews like I normally do, and what a dissaster!  The tray broke (locking clip on left side broke off) and now my 1 year old can easily pop off the tray with one kick of his leg.  The tray itself is not adjustable so  as he gets bigger he will outgrow it.  The booster is not as compact as I thought, so I don't really know how much better of a traveling seat it is than others.  So next time....I will check the reviews first!  Lesson learned.",0
"This is a great gym for tummy time, for playing with the baby or for letting her entertain herself. My daughter especially likes the mirror, but the other toys are good too. The butterfly toy on mine is NOT motion activated - you have to squeeze the head to make it light up and play music. I don't know which version they are currently selling. I like the mini-boppy pillow that comes with this - she looks much more comfortable propped up on the pillow than just laying flat on her back.  Unfortunately my cats also love this product so we can't leave it sitting out or it gets covered in fur!",1
I received this as a gift and I am so glad I did. It is a beautiful toy with wonderful vibrant colors. Love the fact that Thing 1 and 2 are the bells on each side and that the fabric have different textures. Absolutely love it.,1
Love these bibs!  They are easy to clean and dry quickly.  I use them for both my baby and toddler.,1
"The flanges themselves were great.  Much more comfortable than the Medela ones that came with my pump, however when they were placed properly on my breasts the change in angle caused the collection bottles to hit me in the ribs. (This is when they were directly placed into the connector.) The only way I could get these to work was to rotate the entire collection bottle off to the side of my body which meant the bottles were nearly horizontal and I couldn't fully put my arms down.  It was just a giant hassle. If I tried to place the flanges inside my Medela flanges, the neck portion of the Pumpin' Pals weren't long enough to reach, so the two wouldn't fit properly together.  If you forced it you could get the pieces together, but the hold wasn't strong enough so the pump couldn't get any suction.",0
Purchased the BOB Revolution SE Double in December and it's great. Very easy to fold and put in my vehicle. My two year old loves it and his baby sister will soon enough (she's too small for it now). Great deal on Amazon for this stroller.,1
"Size 1 fits well for my newborn and adjustable for later. Not too big ! Works well, go ahead !",1
"Perfect for a baby's room. Cute and easy to use, easy to remove. Safe and easy to apply where desired.",1
This was a convenient way to cart my son around the airport. It was pretty easy to detach and reattach as needed.,1
"I don't have a baby yet, but I saw this in the Amazon outlet for crazy cheap, and since I'm TTC, I was like wth, I'll get it.  I can't wait to use it, the pattern is so pretty - I wasn't sold on the picture online, I'm not into bright colors, but when it came in, the material has this super soft, silky feel, and the colors, while vibrant, aren't obnoxious.  And it's super roomy.  Again, I haven't actually used the bag yet, so I can't attest as to the use of it, but I can tell you it looks like it will be perfect.",1
"This potty was exactly what I was looking for.  I had read the reviews and purchased it based on what others shared, it its as good as advertised.  My son is two and small for his age, and its a good size for him.  It is easy to clean and very stable, my son seems very happy to sit on it although using it for its intended purpose is a different story.",1
"I usually don't do reviews but I hate wasting money and want to helo others make an informed purchase. You definitely need a bath sponge insert for baby, but don't get this one. It mildewed with black spots all over it about the third or fourth time I used it. I always laid it out to dry as well. Just got the blue one from Safety 1st that is supposed to be mildew resistant and so far it's awesome.",0
Works perfectly with Graco snap n lock style. Easily inserted and removed. Very glad I got for my newborn. Love it!,1
My baby and I love this mat.  She stares at the colors and it is large enough for her to roll around on. It is great to travel with and I am able to take it with me everywhere.  A great product!!!,1
"Not sure if it is clear in the description, but this wedge has two pieces of foam and a zipper up the back.  The zipper can actually be felt at the bottom front of the wedge.  I can't really lay my son in the middle of this wedge, because the zipper from the back causes a hard bump at the bottom, front, middle of this wedge.  Also, there is not much of an incline with this wedge.  Overall, just not a great product and I wish I would not have purchased this.",0
My daughter has had her 'loveys' since she was a baby and she is now 4. She sleeps with them every night!  Needless to say we have gone through quite a few and it's nice to have backups!  I like how this pack gets you two!!!,1
"I put all the bottles, pump stuffs, and even tubing in there to sterilize. It's easy and fast. One of the must have items. I use Tomme Tippee bottles. They are a little wider and a lot more stuffs to sterilize so you can fit about 4-5 bottles in the container.FYI: My husband thought you just need to rise the bottle and put it in here to sterilize. Not a good idea. Yes, it does make the bottle clean but the whole steamer will start to smell like milk. I had to get rid of the smell with some vinegar.",1
"I bought this swing for our second son and he's used it for the past 4 months. He loves to watch the lights and fall asleep while swinging. It's light and portable so you can take it anywhere. My first son, who is 20 months now, loves the swing too. We try to keep him out of it since he's 32 pounds and WAY over the weight limit, but he's always sneeking into it. After all the abuse it's taken from my toddler, it still works wonderfully. Great product, I'd recommend it anyone.",1
My little grandbaby loves it. It isn't that great if they dont really suck hard to keep it in thier mouths but as she has gotten a couple months older it is a hand thing to play with and work on grasping things. I would have others as back up but I think it is great especially for outings.,1
"I don't know if there's outside interference but it will take me 10 minutes, at least, to be able to get a picture on the screen.  Then when i get the picture to appear, it disappears to static just a few minutes later.  The audio won't even work.I can't believe i blew $100 on this monitor.  What a waste.",0
Organic midweight cotton.  The blanket is a great size.  Stitching is quality.  Made from soft flexible very comfortable feeling cotton.  made in india.,1
"the bouncy seat is cute; however, music option works but vibration does not.  Figured that out after whole thing put together.  I bought as Christmas present for my 3 month old.  Not sure if worth the effort/time of packing back up to return.....Especially since only will use for a few months before outgrown.",0
This is one of my very favorite purchases for our new baby girl! I plan on taking it to the hospital with me on the &#34;big day&#34;.,1
"I keep trying this diaper and it keeps leaking. Over and over, new sheets, more laundry, upset soggy baby. I've had enough.We do not have this issue with the Bumgenius and Thirsties brand cloth diapers we have. Those are both great.",0
Works great!  I am a 36G currently and ordered the large.  Highly recommend if you need to do other things while you are pumping!,1
"I love my babyhawk. It makes taking care of my 7 month old so much easier. I can get stuff done without her fussing about wanting to be held, we can take long walks and hike. It's the best thing ever!",1
"I am expecting my third child and ordered this blanket to replace some others that have shown worn from our previous 2 children. It arrived today and I'm very impressed. It is a good size, large enough to swaddle a baby, and yet not overly bulky...perfect!--My main reason for ordering was to use it as a bath blanket. From previous experience, I've learned that laying a light-weight blanket inside the baby bath before placing baby in there keeps baby warmer and less fussy during bath time. (Wrap loosly around baby and then unwrap a corner at a time to bathe.)---This blanket will be perfect for bath time, swaddling, extra covering in the car seat, stroller, and swing, large enough for a nursing blanket, and more. And, I love that it is 100% cotton so it will not get ""pilly"" as other blankets. I'm very impressed and plan on ordering one or two more.",1
"We're still working on getting it to stay in place.  We've tried shoving a towel between it and the head rest, and now we're going to have to step it up, maybe with some tape?  Rope?  It's a little frustrating.  But when it works, it's great to be able to glance back and see my baby's face, ONLY when at stops or when traffic is light!  No gazing!!  :)",0
"We bought this to obstruct our obnoxious beagle from getting into the kitchen, and to keep our equally obnoxious child in the kitchen while we worked. Fits the door great. Used the sticky backs to adhere the wall cups instead of putting screws in the wall, and they can withstand fairy significant forces. My child hangs on it and my dog often tries to stand up against it and it has never budged from where it was installed. The door opens both ways and the latch is easy to use for an adult. If you swing it open far enough and let it slam shut the latch will engage itself, but often it doesn't, and that may be my only knock on this product. Has nice aesthetic appeal compared to plastic or wood products and is priced fairly reasonably given how well it works and how sturdy it is.",1
"I love this swing and so does my son! he likes that we can ajust the puppies for play and really seems to enjoy sitting in this swing much more than the old 1. i also love the angle he sits at both upright and laid back his head does not bobble over after he falls asleep. It really is a nice product I can't express how happy I am with this swing. Our safty 1st piece o crap stopped swinging my boy at 15 lb. exactly, depriving my darling of his precious rest. After much research and deliberation my husband and i decided on this one. It has 30 lb. weight limit most r only 25 lb. it glides so smoothly with 6 speed settings and I love the classical music it plays. It takes up very little space and looks nice to.",1
"I've had a couple of these, and will say that it will work for a while, but, depending on how careless you are with it, the strap itself will likely eventually crack and break.  The first one I used lasted about 4 months, the second one, maybe 6 weeks.  (I think we were getting tired of being careful with the second one!)Unlike another type of lock, this one does allow you to turn the lazy susan all the way around, however the strap tends to get caught in the process and get damaged.  Depending on whether the strap half is secured to the door of the LS cabinet, or to the molding (or whatever) on one side of the door, the strap has to be either held back as the cabinet goes around, or you'll have to be mindful of it's position as it swings out of the cabinet.We didn't have a lot of problem with the adhesive... swabbed the mounting areas with rubbing alcohol to remove any dirt/grease, and it stuck pretty well!!I'm ordering more~~and being more careful with that strap!",1
"Very pretty, unique pattern. Matched my daughter's room well. After nearly 2 years it's still in one piece, which is saying something with all the washings it's had. It has however, faded a bit.",1
"If you are wondering if this mattress will fit in a Graco Pack n Play, wonder no longer. It is a perfect fit. It also happens to be a nice mattress with inner springs in it. I bought this because I needed some way to put my daughter to sleep at an incline to help with a reflux problem, so I put a couple of regular pillow underneath one end of it, and that worked like a charm. However, even if you don't need to incline the mattress I would still recommend buying it. It is much more comfortable than the hard bottom of the Pack n Play, and it fits all the way to the edges perfectly.",1
This product prevents me from throwing away perfectly good cups because of a lost or damaged valve.  It is great that we can order replacements.  Now I have extras.,1
"Pros: easy peasy installation compared to regular infant car seats. Roomy yet snug.Cons: harness ends up in an awkward position to put the baby in and out of the seat, not supportive enough for a sleeping baby's head",1
I have a Bugaboo Bee with the regular canopy for my older son and does not give as much coverage as this one; this works perfect when kids are smaller and still napping frequently so the sun won't get directly to their baby eyes =),1
"Unfortunately, the rubber valves don't work well. They easily get misaligned and require constant adjustment for my toddler to use them. Great bottle, but save them for older kids. Skip the sippy caps.",0
Very Trendy burp cloths but seem little smaller compared to other burp cloths. still need to put this item to use but they look great.,1
"This mesh gate was purchased to keep a Yorkie puppy within a specific area in the apartment. All of the gates I found in local area stores would not extend wide enough to cover the doorway and the few that did were quite expensive. However, this gate met the measurement requirements and despite the Yorkie continuously jumping against it in an attempt to get out, it has stood firm and has met all of my expectations.",1
"I just received the baby girl necessities photo mat in 3D and just love it.  In addition, I ordered 2 school years scrap a mat school days mats and I loved them too.  The 3D mat is really done up so beautifully with the little 3D dress and other items and I am giving this to my daughter in law as part of a baby shower gift.  I know she will love it, too.I am so completely satisfied with Bellas Dream Photo Mats.  It's fun just looking at all of the mat designs and colors they have. I have dealt with them on a replacement issue and they have exceeded my expectations in how it was handled.  I highly recommend them if you need to either give a unique gift to someone or just want to have a quality product for your own child or children.  Definitely will purchase from Bellas in the future.",1
These fit our pack n play perfectly! Its excellent on the Graco! I think the feel is amazing! I will recommend to othersUpdate!I really loved this the best. It looks so rick and I wish I had sheets like this for her crib,1
"We used these bottles for our last two babies, and were so happy to see they now offer a BPA Free bottle, too!",1
"Very easy to install! Feels a tad flimsy when you're putting it up, but once its properly installed, its very sturdy. My 80-pound pit bull jumps on it and it doesn't budge. Highly recommended!",1
Great product! My son loves them since he is very much found of Toy Story and especially Buzz Lightyear character.,1
Didn't come with the cushion so I had to order it and wait another week just to set up the swing,0
"This mirror is cute.  The colors are bold, which is great for baby and the mirror and surrounding fabric is soft.  However, I wanted a mirror to stand up (Lamaze made one that was great, but unfortunately discontinued).  This one doesn't stand up well as shown in the picture.  It lays good, but my son, who is now 6 months, wants to push up on his hands while he's on his belly and gets really frustrated with the mirror because it falls quite frequently.  It's an okay mirror...",0
"I have been using these for 7 months, and they have worked out great. Completely compatible with Medela pump.  Only have one very slight issue and that is the edges of the flanges are a tad sharp.  Still rates 5 stars in my book.",1
"This toy box is every bit as cute as it looks in the picture.  It's bright and fun and my son loves it instantly.  My only complaint is that when I unfolded it, I thought I had mistakenly ordered the medium size.  The dimensions are correct, but if you're like me you don't actually look at a ruler to determine the size.  I thought large meant large and the pic of the little girl sitting beside it was what I used for judging the size.  That must be a small little girl is all I have to say.  I still think it was a worthwhile purchase, but it isn't going to hold anywhere near as many toys as I had hoped.",1
"I bought this to put my baby's wet or soiled clothes in while on the go or at the daycare. It is GREAT when the daycare uses it but that is not the products fault. ;) the teachers that do know about it, love it and say it makes it easy just to stick her dirty clothes in. I like it better than re-using grocery bags or they would also put her bibs in a plastic glove. LOL Its easy for me to know all her clothes is in one spot ready to go in the hamper as well. I have gotten great use out of this!",1
Love that they have a camo pattern! The quality is really nice and the length of the strap is good too. Very secure clasp.,1
"This is a great alternative to the super expensive top brand. I use this pump at least 3 times a day, sometimes more and so far no problems. It travels with me back and forth to work daily. While it did not come with a bag, I found one that worked well in my free stuff from the hospital.  It is easy to use and clean up. Additionally, it works with any traditional size bottle neck, which is nice, because the bottles it comes with are only 4oz a piece and I can easily pump about 10oz from each breast.  Also, after using a hand pump for weeks before hand, the electric pump rocks! I only gave it a 4 star rating because of the beeping sound. It is part of the motor I think and occurs with each round of suction. If you can deal with the beeping noise, this pump is the way to go. I have managed to block it out when I pump so to me it's completely worth the $200 I saved by purchasing this model.",1
"I spent the better part of 3 months searching for one of those big comfy gliders and kept overlooking the wooden gliders for fear of being uncomfortable.  I finally decided that I refuse to spend $500 + on a chair that I won't be using for more than 5 years. After looking around on amazon for a great wooden glider for about 2 weeks, I decided on this one. I have to say, I'm extremely impressed. It was very easy to put together, my hubby had it put together in less than 20 minutes, it's sooo comfortable I could fall asleep in it, and it doesn't make the same creaking noise my other wooden rocker did. I am very impressed and I'm glad I made the decision that I did. My mother in law has threatened to sneak into the baby's room and rock in it by herself, just so she can fall asleep!",1
"I buy these as burp rags and they are by far the best out there. They are extremely soft and get a nice bubbly texture to them, and get softer and softer with each wash. There are no thick seamed edges or hard corners. They fit perfectly over the shoulder, fold up small to go anywhere, and are very soft to use on baby.I dont cloth diaper, so for me I think these would actually do better marketed as burp cloths. I think for actual diapers they might be thin and the weave too loose. However the softness would also make them more stretchy as a result, allowing for a snug yet comfortable fit if you were to use them as diapers.My last bunch of these are still going strong and have been washed probably a thousand times and used for just about any household task. Now with a new baby on the way I have purchased three more fresh packs. You will truly get your moneys worth on these, no matter what you use them for.",1
"Perhaps our door jamb is non-standard (with &#34;rounded&#34; edges on one side), but the clip would not prevent the door from opening when applying repeated, mild force (as a toddler would).  If you purchase this, test it profusely, and make sure the clip does not become disengaged.  It could be that this product is just not compatible with some door jambs.  We returned it to Amazon.",0
I liked it very much. It is resistant and easy to pull in and out of the diaper bag and everything is still in order.,1
Been wearing the self adhesive silicone pasties for about 2 years and won't ever b without them. I wear bra letters under tank tops and these pasties do a little more covering on the nipple area. If u don't want a full coverage bra on hot summer days these hide just enough under lightweight bras. I even wear them alone under tanks which have built in bras. Great item,1
"This item is a great idea, but it didn't show how to order the proper size and mine was too small.  I returned it and haven't ordered a new one, but I may order it again later.",1
"My daughter is 3 1/2 months old and has loved this swing since she came home from the hospital.  My daughter take great naps and enjoys looking in the mirror.  I thought it went to fast in the beginning, but once I tried it out, I found she loved it.  She takes her morning nap in it almost everyday.  I wish they made one in my size.  It is worth every penny.",1
"A friend of ours gave us a suction cup toy for my son who just turned three months old.  After attaching it to his high chair and seeing how excited he was to play with something while sitting up, I went to find some similar toys.  I found this one at Target and figured I'd give it a try even though it said 6+ months on it.  He LOVES it.  It spins and plays sounds and music with every bat of the hand, it has really started to improve his ability to grasp objects as well.  The suction cup works very well on both the high chair tray and the small tray that attaches to his swing.  I'm looking forward to buying him several of these types of toys so we can rotate them and keep him entertained.",1
Easy to install....took 20 minutes for 12 cabinets.  No screws needed so you won't ruin your nice cabinets.  Solid locking ability.  Easy to open.  Will buy more and child proof the rest of the house.,1
"I bought this for by 2 yr old so she would have her own place to do yoga, but she barely fit on it in down dog now.  It says it fits until 4 yrs, but I cannot see how that could possibly be true.",0
My wife uses these to hang some snack bags and her purse and they are easy to use. I'll order her a couple more since it's so convenient.,1
"The warmer works pretty good. It can warm up a 4 oz bottle in under 3 minutes making middle of the night feedings a little easier. My only complaint is that even if you follow instruction by loosening the bottle caps, some milk will still get into the reservoir and it is difficult to clean out (and smells if you don't). If it was easier to clean, it would be perfect.",1
"I received a &#34;bath lounger&#34; as a baby shower gift and thought it was just the cutest little thing - looked like a beach chair for bathing the baby! I had barely laid him on it when he nearly slipped right off. My mother in law told me about the &#34;bath sponge&#34; and I while I stared at her like she had 2 heads, I looked it up, and I'm glad I did. This thing was so perfect while my son was little:Pros: lays flat in the sink/tub; you can let the water warm up while running over it, and since it's a sponge it holds the heat/water so it's comfortable for your little one; wrings dry quickly and easily; CHEAPCons: None. We used this thing for 6 months with no issues.",1
"Super easy to clean and very durable.  I love this high chair, it matches my table nicley. I would have gave it a 5 star review except it came with no hardware.  But after I mentioned this to the seller he promptley shiped it staight to me.",1
I got this walker for my grandson and I am very pleased with it.  I like the fact it doesn't have a bunch of stuff on the tray.  It feels very clean and streamlined.,1
My daughter started in a swaddle and upgraded to the sleepsack. Halo makes a top notch product and this is our second size increase in this product. We also have the cotton for summer and the fleece for winter. She is squirmy and would never keep blankets on so this is the perfect solution. Also no need to worry about covers tangling or going over her head. A sound warm sleep for her and a little piece of mind for me!,1
2 year old granddaughter loves it! Holds many of her favorite things. Easy to carry around. Cute owl face and colorful.,1
"Got these today, and they are alright, they are not quite as nice as they look in the picture.They are little material and cardboard bins that fold out, and they have pink material inserts with cardboard separators that go in the bins to create the sections.Could just be mine but my inserts do not really fit properly, but in the end the job gets done. I suppose having the removable inserts is nice if anything spills in there.They are alright but keep in mind you get what you pay for and they are only $9. I will use them, but am keeping my eye out for something a bit sturdier.",0
"I initially got this for my peg perego switch - i needed some extra storage for wipes/diapers and some basic infant essentials - things I knew I'd need ALL the time and used this saddle bag as my """"back up"""" in case I forgot it (prone when you're a new mommy). Since my son has grown we've switched to a lightweight stroller - well with a lightweight stroller you give up storage - not with the saddlebag.I've now attached this to the handlebars - across the BACK of my peg perego aria as an organizer (this stroller is too short in depth to use a saddlebag). SO USEFUL!! I now have full size storage in a lightweight stroller.I highly recommend this as an add on to umbrella/lightweight strollers - you may give up storage in the under carriage - but this makes up for it!! Keep your items stored and secured and easy access. The velcro straps are long enough to attach to almost any size stroller - my lightweight is pretty wide and I still have about 3 inches of velcro left on each side.",1
"We bought this gate as a barrier between the wood stove we just installed and our two year old daughter. She is curious about and gets into everything and we knew she would burn herself sooner than later. The gate was a little pricier than we would have liked initially but upon shipment we found it to be worth every penny and more. It's sturdy, the auto-close door works like a charm, and it was more than easy to setup and install. Most importantly it gives us the peace of mind that our daughter cannot and will not be able to get past it to the wood stove. It's a great product and a testament to the old &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; adage. We will certainly buy another of these if we need to block off a large area.",1
"I bought this mattress in June 2009 for the upcoming Sept baby. I have not been disappointed. My son seems comfortable, slept through the night in his crib from day 3. I use an organic cotton waterproof cover over this mattress, and I have to say, you wouldn't think this will be nearly 2 years old this June! My husband and I are expecting another baby this October, and I am certainly buying a second one. I agree with another reviewer, I wish this was KING sized for me!",1
"I bought this product before my daughter was born. I took it out to play with it to see how it worked in light and dark rooms. The picture was clear enough to see the baby move around and the sound worked great (I experimented with my 6 month old nephew) The monitor was large and heavy, not something you would want to carry around. I believe it did have options for battery or a/c power. I finally decided I wanted something that was smaller and in color that you could plug into the TV. So I took it back and upgraded to the Summer's color baby monitor which also very well and I am very happy with. The sound had very little to no static in it for my house, which I do not have anything else that works on 900mhz here.",0
You just set my little girl under her mobile and turn on one of the classical songs and she turns to all smiles and starts talking to it! And at night I feed her lay her in the crib and turn on her mobile and she's out cold by the end of the song :),1
"This review is for the Universal Bedside Co-Sleeper, which is exactly the same as the Original except it's sized for beds that are 18-24 inches tall (the Original is sized for beds that are 24 inches tall and taller).After only a few weeks of using a traditional, high-sided cradle for our baby (who gets up to nurse several times in a night), we decided that we needed something to make moving the baby between her bed and ours easier.  We chose the bedside co-sleeper and we haven't been disappointed.The low side of the co-sleeper is level with our mattress, and the mattress of the co-sleeper is about 4 inches lower than that.  This means that when my baby wakes in the middle of the night to nurse, I only have to lift her four inches to get her into my bed.  I don't even have to sit up to manage this.  Plus, since there are no bars or slats between her bed and mine, when she's fussy at night I can easily reach out a hand to soothe her or find the pacifier she's let slip from her mouth.  The four outside pockets (one on each short end and two on the long end) are convenient for holding burp cloths, extra diapers, baby wipes, etc - everything I need for late-night feeding and changing.Some reviewers have complained that the mattress is too hard.  Actually, I found that the mattress is padded but lumpy.  This is because it's designed to fold up (so the co-sleeper can be portable and fit into a travel bag).  I solved the problem by putting a Quilted Multi-Use Pad on top of the mattress underneath the fitted sheet.  The quilting helped smooth out the lumps and make the mattress more comfortable without making it so soft that I'm worried about a smothering hazard.  Also, the pad is good protection for the mattress in case of nighttime accidents, since the mattress is made only of cloth with no plastic cover (unlike typical cradle mattresses).  Be sure to buy at least one extra fitted sheet when you purchase the bed (one is included with the bed itself) since regular crib or cradle sheets won't fit.My only complaint so far is that the solid fabric sides of the co-sleeper prevented me from hanging my baby's crib toys on the bed.  Otherwise, I've found this bed to be an absolute lifesaver and the only kind of infant bed I would recommend.",1
"My sister-in-law LOVES this baby blanket. She uses it all the time for my new nephew in the stroller, on the floor, etc. It's so soft and the pattern is cute retro.",1
"i bought this stroller specifically because of the higher handles and the price.  Gosh this is so much more comfortable too push at my height (5'8&#34;).  it's comfortable safe, has storage, etc.  The price is right.  Great stroller.",1
"I followed the directions exactly to install this safety lock. The first one, on our sliding glass door, popped off the first time it was opened. Thinking maybe I just had one faulty product, I tried a second one. Waited 48 hours as per the instructions, opened the door (this time my 6 year old daughter did it), the thing pops right off. Even the ones on my windows have fallen off just from the kids opening the window once or twice.This product is trash, it does not work at all. Don't waste your money.",0
"really you need to have this product for relaxing and good breathing of your baby, i couldn't believe the difference until i tried it, and very recommended by pediatrician of our premi baby.",1
"Reviewer:  James Daniels (Columbus, OH) - See all my reviewsWe bought our first backpack, a compact, secondhand. We weren't sure if we'd like it, of if our child would like it. Well, we loved it, and we recently upgraded to the Cross Terrain. We had no idea what we were missing!It's hard to believe how well designed this pack is, compared to our previous one. It fits better, holds the kid better, and the features are superb. If the price is keeping you away, check out the Cross Country, which is exactly the same, except it has fewer pockets and somewhat less padding. We splurged on this one for the brighter color and the extra pockets.Plus side: The main advantages of this backpack over our prior compact are it's enlarged storage spaces, better padding on all the straps, fully adjustable (and easy to adjust) straps all around. Since we do a lot of walking at dusk, the built in reflective strips and lighter color (Gray) were selling points as well. The kid straddles the lower pack; they can't stand up or launch themselves out of it (which is why we upgraded), and they can't kick you or ride with their knees in your back. Also, there are plenty of pockets, even a cell-phone and water-bottle holder.Minus side: The main drawbacks are: the price (~2x a compact), though cheaper than most high-end hiking packs. The pack is also heavier than our prior compact, but not prohibitively so. Finally, the ""landing gear"" that holds it upright on the ground doesn't have a hard lock when deployed (unlike some brands), so you have to be careful when setting it down with the kid onboard.Niggling minus points (engineers take note): the reflective strips are nice, but smaller than I had hoped. The pockets are numerous, but it seems like they went overboard. The sun visor is hard to attach, but not that hard. I consider these all minor.Whatever pack you buy, make sure it fits before you get it. Put the kid in and do some shopping. Get someone to show you how to adjust it properly.",1
"This comes just as described in a much shorter time frame than stated. This shipped from China and arrived to our door in about a week, so shipping time was great. The Seahorse itself is just as pictured, and the same batteries are in it that it came with and they are still going strong. Comes shipped in a sealed bag in a box, so there was no shipping residue. Very pleased with this purchase.",1
"I was put off by the cost of the electric pumps so I settled on this after doing A TON of research on pumps. The biggest benefit is that it doesn't hurt - those little inserts really work to protect the tatas! I also find it to be quick for a manual pump - I can pump a 6-8 oz. bottle in 10-15 minutes.I used this exclusively for the first month or so, pumping 4-5 times every day. I eventually put out the money for the Avent double electric pump (which is SUPER AWESOME...for a breats pump!) but I still use this when I visit family or go away for the weekend.It takes just a few minutes to clean, which is a benefit. I have been using it now for 9 months and it just recently starting squeaking a little at the handle, but it doesn't really bother me - just thought it was worth a mention.Works seamlessly with the Avent bottles, which is a plus (I love those bottles). Overall, I feel like it's a very good value and could definitely be a primary pump. Very happy with this - highly recommend.",1
"I wish I had known about this bra when as soon as my son was born, someone told me to buy this when my little guy  was 6 weeks old and now I can't imagine pumping without it. I am larger chested so I did have some reservations that this whole S-XL size would fit but it fits perfectly, I love that it zippers in the front and as the adjustable back!!! This bra was a life saver, time saver and it really helped my supply increase due to being able to pump more effectively. I will be purchasing another one to take to work with me!!",1
"My son is four years old and I have bought at least 6 different bathtub toy organizers. None of them worked properly. They either didn't hold enough toys, didn't dry the toys out well, or, the biggest problem, didn't stay suctioned to the tub!!! This toy holder has a ton of toys packed into it and still stays up. It doesn't move, shift, or fall down at all. I would recommend this to anyone. DO NOT WASTE your time buying any other toy holder. Best thing EVER!!!!",1
"I love the Playtex Nurser bottles! I love that you don't have so many pieces per bottle to wash like the Ventaire bottles. You only need to wash/sterilize the nipples, caps, and rings, which saves a new mom lots of time. The wide nipples do make it a little hard for the baby to latch on at first but they get used to it. I also like the drop ins because I know they are presterilized so I don't worry about the germs for my baby. The fact that the bags help reduce the air the baby intakes is also a bonus. This set is a great starter kit- it came with two sizes of bottles, the 4 oz for now and the 8 oz for when baby can drink larger amounts and also drop in liners.The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the set only gives you 2 of each bottle size and if you are like me and like to premake a few bottles for convenience, you'll have to buy an additional set to get extra bottles. Also, the drop in liners do have one flaw - the ounce measurements on them are not colored so they blend in and are hard to see; I discovered that they are also inaccurate and are off by 1/2 ounce. I use a Ventaire bottle to measure out her formula and to measure what she didn't drink.Overall these are great bottles and are very convenient.",1
"We fly at least twice a year and with a toddler this is a must purchase! It makes going through the airport sooo much easier. My daughter loves it too. Every time we use it, we catch people trying to steal a sneak peak as to what is holding our carry on and booster together. You also see the envious parents who are pushing a huge stroller, and have giant boosters strapped to their back toting it all around the airport! Best purchase in a long time! At first my husband wasn't buying how it could be so good until the first time we used it.",1
"I purchased this in mid June for a 2 month trip to Tokyo.  Received it promptly from Amazon and it seemed like great quality for the price paid.  (I wanted something of decent quality, knowing it would get used a lot there but not long-term since I don't use strollers at home).  After just one week, one of the leg adjustment pieces broke off.  It just dangled there - did not really affect my 3 year old's comfort, but made it MORE of a hassle to  fold.  Could not really return or exchange since we were out of the country, so figured I would contact manufacturer for parts after we got home.  The stroller came with a one year  warranty.  Mia Moda has a bare bones, if not somewhat sketchy, website but I contacted them via email in late August asking for repair parts.  It is mid-October and no reply of any kind from them.Due to the fact that this stroller broke after barely being used, it is not easy to fold, and now after a few months the ""open-close"" latch has broken as well, I recommend DO NOT BUY this brand or model.",0
"I was so excited to get this carrier and I must say it's more than met my expectations. It is so comfortable and easy to use. The chair seat feature (that I thought I really wouldn't use that much) is really handy, too. My husband even used the carrier when we went hiking one day and he loved it. I would definitely recommend this style to anyone!",1
"Very cute favor boxes, everyone loved them. They were the perfect size for a shower favor, not too small or too large. Quality product - I folded 48 of these boxes and only one of them had an issue - the glue did not hold on the side while I was folding it.",1
"These Antique Rose bloomers were made by my FAV Seamstress ""My Baby's Closet""..... Her work is impeccable and so innovative.  Everytime I receive an item that I ordered from her it is beyond my expectations!!!  Thank you so much, Liz!!!",1
"Of course, every baby has his/her own preferences, but my 4 1/2 month old grandson really took to this teether! The soft handle was easy for him to grasp and he likes to chomp on it, especially the bristles. He can even make funny, almost crunchy sounds with it. Nice find! My son thinks I find the best things for his baby son! :)",1
"Brown adds a welcome splash of well, not exactly sophistication, but maybe &#34;grown-upness&#34; to this diaper bag. The tote style with all the outside pockets makes it easy to separate and find baby's items, and the straps make it easy to hoist on your shoulder.  However, this style is probably not the best choice for someone who must carry it on the bus or subway -- too easy for someone else to reach into it (or, for that matter, a toddler sibling to rummage through it.)",1
"I read the reviews for this and decided despite some negative comments to give it a try since it was so cheap....at first I was impressed with this shade because it attached quite easily to my stroller and actually provided shade to my baby (although not as much as it looks like it would - his legs were never protected from the sun even though it looked liked they would be because the shade is so big). My stroller is a pretty typical stroller, nothing special or comlpicated about it.  But yes, it did flip up in the wind or even a small breeze very easily and i had to weigh it down which didn't really work because it is so flimsy.  After about 2 weeks it lost its shape completely and the front of it flipped up and no longer provided coverage AT ALL.  Piece of junk.",0
I was NOT looking forward to the slouching with the second child.  Now that I have the Juppy I can walk normally and I last A LOT longer!  My husband loves it too.  It saves his back so much!  Definitely worth the price and it is very high quality.  Thanks for such a smart invention!,1
I got this letter for my daughter's room and it looks beautiful on the wall. The expresso  finish gives it a touch of elegance. The quality of the material is very good.,1
"I own both theMedela Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump with On the Go Toteand the Philips Avent SCF332/01 BPA Free Comfort Single Electric Breast Pump.I've never managed to express from both breasts at the same time with the Medela. The reason is that expressing is never easy for me, I often have to take several pauses to get the milk flowing again and that is impossible to control and manage on 2 breasts at the same time, so my fault, not the pump's. I can only write about how the Pump in Style works while expressing from one breast only.Comparing their advantages over the other:AVENT CONS:- Gentler on the nipples. Avent's vaccuum builds more progressively, Medela's build more suddenly and it hurts my nipples.Plus Avent's got a silicone shield sleeve that makes it much more comfortable, altough the sleeve won't work when the breast is really full.- Smaller and less cumbersome- Easier to operate- Less leakage and more comfortable to use. Avent's design allows you to sit back, with the Medela you have to sit really straight or lean forward to avoid milk leaking back from the shield- More suited for smaller nipples. With the Medela it takes several tries to insert the nipple in the shield straight without touching the sides, which will hurt even more.MEDELA CONS:- More powerful- Easier to dissemble and cleanI prefer the Avent and have managed to express much more milk with it with no pain and raw nipples. The Medela made expressing uncomfortable and hurt my nipples.",1
"The stokke stroller is pretty minimalist and, as such, you have to purchase separately the cup holder for the handle. It is worth it. Everything about stokke is expensive and so you just have to bite the bullet but after $1300 for the stroller, a few extra bucks for the cup holder won't kill you.",1
"I ordered this for my granddaughter's crib from Pottery barn.  It came quickly, fit perfectly and is the best value out there!",1
It is so cute in person!!! I'm excited for my little one to get here and use it. The only bad thing is the window valence is quite long for a normal window so trimming might be advised.,1
"My first child had reflux and I didn't want my second child to have to suffer the way he did.  I saw a brochure for the Dr. Brown's bottles in my OB-GYN's office and thought ""this sounds exactly like what I am looking for"".  When I told my pediatrician I was planning to use these she was thrilled.  She said these were the best bottles on the market.We used the pre-made bottles that we got from the hospital for days after bringing our daughter home.  Then I started with Dr. Browns bottles.  It was AMAZING!  We saw a difference in the very first feeding.  She was happier, less gassy and much more content.  Don't wait!  Get them and use them as soon as possible.She starting sleeping thru the night at 5 weeks old.  Now she is 3 months old and the happiest baby most people have ever seen!These bottles are often hard to find but just ask!  The sales people will tell you where they are!",1
"My 16 month old and 7 year old both use these when we are at a restaurant. They protect the kids from table germs, protect the table from crayons and food messes, and keeps the kids occupied with drawing or coloring. It was a good price for 16 mats too. Perfect!",1
"These liners are very soft but they are not my favorite. They bunch up, so they defeat the main purpose of its usage..I still have to clean poop from diaper and I cannot trust these liners while using diaper rash cream. These liners just don't stay properly.",0
"Whom ever designed this product obviously didn't use it on a big baby, or a wiggly baby.  I love the colors, and I love the mesh cradle that can be hooked to the tub for a newborn.  However, there is a huge hump in the middle to create a seat, and it can't be removed.  If the baby lays in the mesh, and is heavier than like 9 lbs, they sag and their back is laying right on the uncomfortable hump. Or, if you want to submerge their body in the water, they have to sit on the seat, and most of their body is out of the water, and only their feet are in the actual bath.  This wouldn't be a huge problem if a washcloth was placed on them to keep them from getting cold, however, my baby likes to wiggle, and would wiggle right out of the seat over the hump, and slip in the bath water. He did this over and over, and it made it very hard to give him a bath.  The tub part below the seat is small too, so a baby can't just lay in it.  My baby was all squished. Since I can't just lay him in the water of the tub because it is too small with the hump in the middle, and I couldn't put him on the seat because he would wiggle out, I had to stop using the tub when he was only like 2 months old!!  My older son used this tub for a while, and did well in it...but he didn't try to wiggle out of it, so I could actually sit him on the seat, and he would sit still.  Cute tub, fun toys that come with it, but I hate the hump in the middle!  SO annoying!!! I wish I could remove it!!!",0
"I love these cups. They stack well, come in great gender neutral colors, and have little drainer holes at the bottom. My son loves playing in the tub and these cups seem to provide him with entertainment. I highly recommend them.",1
This is really toothbrush? my son uses it as his favorite teether.it's soft for his gum and it seems to stimulate circulation on his gum. and perfect for after bath routine.definitely would recommend for friends,1
"I used this bottle with my son, and ordered them from the podee website. I also heard about them on TV. Our son loved them, and he could ""feed himself"". I did love holding him to feed him but admit I have fallen asleep before. I am sure we all have. My husband is handicapped, so meal times were a super busy time. I could easily fix the bottle for my son, and our meal. We could all sit together and eat at the same time. Its easy to start the nipple with just a few squeezes to it, and you can replace the nipple with ""slow"" or ""fast"" flow nipples.Enjoy! I always wanted to get these for a baby shower. I think they would make a great gift.",1
wonderful baby blanket good size to nap with and small enough to take in the diaper bag. very soft and wellmade,1
"my daughter is still getting the hang of this cup but she likes it better than her sisters big girl cups. they like the design and the cup is 10 ozs and holds more milk and water for her rather than her soft spout 7 oz cup she was using with handles, this is helping her on her way to using a regular cup.",1
"This IS a nice spatula, but I was looking for a ""lifting platform"" with a SUPER-THIN depth/thickness ... for an art project. This spatula regretably, and unfortunately, missed the mark for SUPER-THIN.But I did move the spatula out my art studio and into my kitchen ... where it's perfectly adequate. But it's still not as thin as I'd like, even in the kitchen.",0
"These microphone windscreens aren't quite as attractive or look quite as nice as other windscreens I've purchased.  The material used seems a bit different than most, but I think they'll work out fine. I also don't think I would recommend these windscreens for professional sound company use, but to have some extra windscreens on hand for outdoor situations, they'll do and are better to have than not having any windscreens on the mics at all.",0
"I wish I could explain how much I love this mat. My son loved to sit and read books on it or snuggle up on it while watching a movie. It's just so cute, so soft, and it's useful (especially if you have hard floors.) I didn't utilize it while my kids were newborns, because we have dogs who also loved to lay on it! Speaking of dogs, it has the wonderful feature of being machine washable (but lay it flat to air dry!) It has stayed as soft as ever, two years later. I love it so much that I have bought several more in different designs for baby shower gifts, and the moms have all had nothing but rave reviews regarding their Bestever mats.",1
I agree with all the reviews so far! It is unusable as it is impossible to get the liquid out of it. My husband and I couldn't even figure it out! Do NOT buy!,0
"I got this off my baby registry. I love it! Yes, it is very large but it should be.. There will be lots of things going into it! Seems very sturdy and good quality. Great for the price!",1
It's cute but def not worth $20 bucks.  It's about 5 inches off the ground.  Not really sure what 5 inches would do.... Anyway .. the product seems well built but I really need to read descriptions.,1
Liner ripped out of inside on both sides causing shoulder strap foam to fall out and could not be repaired.,0
"Working great, as described. Well built, solid design. Baby likes to play with the turtle, so it's a good distruction. We did try a diffrent thermometer prior to this one, and it died on us after only a couple of baths. We love the turtle and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good quality reliable product.",1
"I bought this as a shower gift for my niece in law and she loved it! It's comparable to a Bumpy but has the added feature of the harness for added security. I really liked this feature. The harness also folds away into it's own pocket if you don't need it, so it's never in the way. I would definitely buy this product again if the need arises.",1
This product went straight into the trash after a few uses.  The nipple was difficult for our son to suck liquid through.  It's the only product he struggled to drink from.,0
"I have a large open living room with dividers, half is a family/play area and the other half is computer/office area. When my little one started to crawl it became obvious that I needed separation between these two areas. I did tons of research on baby gates, and a step over gate wouldn't be suitable for such a high traffic room. That's why this gates been perfect for us! Installation was fairly simple, and unlike others this gate is very sturdy- we've had it up for months now and no problems! Before my son learned to walk we wouldn't push the handle down completely, but after some time he learned to lift the handle in it's unlocked position. Pushed all the way down though, I can easily open the gate with one hand, but my 15mo old cannot. Also, when I want to leave the gate open, the bar on the very bottom is low enough for him to comfortably step over without tripping. This is an awesome gate, sturdy, sure to last you a very long time!",1
I bought this for travel by myself with two kids. I had one in a backpack and the 2+ year old in the TOTEaTOT. It works well but you need a certain size handle and a strong suit case. I did not have problems with the buckles opening up though! It worked okay but it can be hard to pull with a 30+ lbs on board. Also a HUGE draw back is that you cannot roll it all the way to your seat as the car seat does not fit down the ail. Something I had not thought of and was crucial to traveling alone.,0
We have one for the car and one at home. She is so entertained by it. It helps when she is bored and fussy. Great toy!,1
This would make a great gift for a new mother. I like the idea of babies having no gas and am glad they found a way to get the air out of bottle. (It would have been nice if they had known how to do that 37 years ago when my baby was born. I thought she smiled a lot until someone told me the smiling was gas pains...:) I like the new design of the nipples on these too. You can always count on Playtex to make good products and make them safe.,1
I now have 4 of these food jars. They are great for holding warm foods for lunches. They leak only if the lid isn't set right or tightened enough. No problem with food staying warm for about 4-5 hours.,1
"My wife has tried several baby carriers with both of our sons and none of them seamed to work for her or the kids.  A friend of ours recommended Mei Tai carrier, so we thought we'd give it a shot.  This carrier has been perfect.  It is very supportive and easy to get the baby in by yourself.",1
"Received a item that seems to be used for a long time.Its outward condition was bad as if it were used for a long time.if it's the new one, because of its improper package seems it to be old and used.I don't recommend this to anyone now.",0
Bough these because I thought they would be great for the upcoming winter for my 2010 Visa but they don't fit (stay on)Would have been nice to see that written down that they don't fit all the Vista models!!,0
Our 4 year old loves this vibrant duvet! It's very girly...goes great with the rest of her hot pink rose room. Washes well and it's very soft. We stuffed it with a down alternative blanket and it looks great. Worth the money!,1
"My 2 year old is obsessed with letter and numbers. These are just great for bath time. We not only work on letter recognition, but spelling. I advise getting 2 sets though because you only get one of each letter.",1
Our son started teething very early and most of the other teethers out there were hard for him to hold or fit in his mouth at 3 1/2 months.  This is the perfect size and weight for those first front teeth. This will definetly go on my baby gift list.,1
Love the HALO sleepsacks but couldn't find one in store that was for a girl and not pink! Love the colors on this one,1
"I have had these bottles for 2 months.  They were great for keeping air out, but the nipple is small.  It's great for a new born not older than a month. After that, my baby seemed to be sucking with a little more trouble.  Later the bottom of the bottles started leaking as soon as I put warm milk in them. It was frustrating.  I had to throw them away.  There was no use in having them anymore.",0
"I used this stroller with a 2,5 year old toddler and fairy quickly found it to be insufficient. Yes, it's easy to navigate because it's smaller than a proper jogger. At the same time i totally hated the two front wheels, because using the stroller in light snow, the front wheels kept getting stuck and turn sideways, hence blocking the stroller from moving. And i really mean LIGHT SNOW. Also my toddler kept &#34;leaping out&#34; from the stroller, since there isn't a 5-point harness, but instead a 3-point one. Because shoulder straps are missing, my toddler figured out fairly fast that she can just jump forward and attempt to get out. It created a lot of dangerous situations when a toddler mid-tantrum decided she is going to &#34;exit the vehicle&#34; while i was speeding towards home. My child generally hated sitting in the City Mini stroller and not before exchanging this stroller for a proper jogger i realized why - it was just too bumpy because City Mini has no suspensions. I gave it up after two weeks of use and bought Baby Jogger Summit x3 instead and i have to say - they are night and day apart!",0
I use this gate to keep my dogs in my kitchen/ dining area. This gate gives a decorative feel. The other gates i had put dents and chips in my paint on the walls. It is easy to install and so much easier to use. I will be getting another for a different entrance.,1
"yeah they're cheap foam but the price reflects that, for what you spend, they work great!  the foam is soft and thick and the two sided tape that comes with it is a pain but all two sided tape is, the people who didn't give this item 5 stars are either old and don't understand the modern world.... or they're un-intelligent.if you need a cheap way to make your sharp edges, baby friendly... this is it!",1
"We love this!  It was SO EASY to set up and, with it having wheels on one side, is super easy to move around.  We have a small dog, so this was a great way for us to put the baby down to play in the baby gym and not worry about the dog trying to play in the gym with him. :)  I would highly recommend this product to anyone considering something like this.Also, some of the reviews mentioned a foul smell that wore off over time, but ours didn't have any odor at all.",1
"These no scratch mittens serve their purpose, which is to keep my newborn son from scratching his face. I like the fact these are white, so they can be easily washed and they coordinate with different outfits.",1
Es hermoso este bolso pa&ntilde;alera... Lo compre casi dos a&ntilde;os y a&uacute;n lo tengo tal como lo compre... Es de muy buenA calidad y muy bonito... Lo recomiedo,1
"For what you pay for this chair works fine. My girl sits in the highest postion just fine. My only beef with this product is you can definitely tell its cheap, but it was only $12.00. The straps she will grow out of really fast, they dont adjust very much. She is 12 months and I think she will be out of it in 4 more months ( SHE IS A BIG GIRL). If you have a big child I wouldn't recommend.  Also the straps pull out fairly easy. The chair works for right now, but when we have another child I think we will upgrade to a different one. If you have the money to get a nicer one I would. This one is a great price though.",0
"We tested three tubs and this was the least expensive, but it was by far the best tub.  No middle bar to hurt little guys, not too much room that you have a floating baby, and it grows with baby and toddler.",1
"As the product description states and some buyers have commented, this does require a latch point behind the seat.Its an very compact for a 5 point harness. Now we can actually have an adult get in and out of the door to sit between the kids when needed.Best of all, my son says its comfortable (age 3) and he's the one that sits in it.",1
"Today's cloth diapers are nothing like the diapers I bought 40 years ago which went through 3 children and still were good.  These are thin enough to see through!  I guess I should have known when they were advertised for car washing.  However, I did get what I paid for and I knew the quality when I purchased them.  I folded them in half and made burp cloths.",0
What I like about this is the tip pulls off easily enabling a quick clean and rinse; easy to pop the tip back on and store.,1
"These provide a nice cushion for the corners of my granite countertops that are at the height of an average preschooler's head. They do slide off occasionally, but slide right back on. I love that they don't use an adhesive.",1
Safe and of easy instalation. It prevents the opening by babies of  small boxes and cases.Will be recommended to potential buyers.,1
"The Baby Brezza has a really sleek design, which fits well in my kitchen. The One-Step process makes it easy to use. Highly recommended!",1
"Just what I was looking for, a diaper bag that fit everything I need to haul around with me for my 2 year old and 6 month old, that is not too bulky or combersome.  I would have given it 5* if it had more pockets on the inside, but it only has 1 side panel ""pocket"" inside the bag.  Side pockets are nice and big, I can fit 2 bottles or 1 sippy cup in them.",1
This was truly a blessing to have throughout my pregnancy! Only complaint is that I wish it would come with a cover that's easier to take off to wash!,1
"Spend your money elsewhere. Like other reviewers, I really wanted to like this seat. It's got great padding for long car rides, the headrest is super easy to adjust and it was easy to install. BUT, the harness is nearly impossible to tighten. The harness moves smoothly when the child is out of the seat, but put the kid back in and it feels like it is almost locked up. The should pads have a rubber backing on them that makes them stick to the clothes and are very bulky.We already own the Chicco KeyFit and expected a similar product. Boy were we wrong. Everyone that gave this 5 stars must be professional weight-lifters because even my husband struggles to get the straps tight enough.",0
"If you use wide top bottles like AVENT or 4 oz Playtex Drop-Ins bottles. I use both of those with this holder and it fits great. My 4 month old can hold this fairly easily and feed herself in the morning while I'm getting the other kids ready for school. It's squishy- not rigid plastic, so it has a gummy texture that's easy for a baby to hold. It doesn't hold the bottles completely upright, so it will take some skill on the part of your baby. My daughter is better at it now that she's 5 months. Everywhere I go shopping or to the park, people ask me where I got this. They are surprised to see my baby drinking her own bottle while I push the stroller. Keep in mind that if your baby isn't strong enough to hold up a bottle, this isn't going to work, but my baby is 15 lbs and loves her bottles- so she has figured out how to tilt it up to self-feed. It might not work for everyone, but it works well for me! Good buy!",1
"Recently switched to cloth diapers and so far the bumGenius are my favorite.  I admit I haven't tried too many others, but I love how easy they are to use and clean.  I thought i'd be grossed out, but it's really not bad at all.We have only had 1 leak so far and it was my own fault.  My daughter looked sleepy so I put her down not expecting her to sleep 5 hours.  I hadn't changed her before hand.  She never takes long naps like that... figures the one time she does I wasn't prepared.  But other than that, they've worked great!  With the disposable diapers we were having leak issues almost every day.  I'm so glad we switched.",1
What a horrible product. Cheap plastic all over & it came in a very damaged box. It is a shame because seemed very cute on the pictures.,0
"After receiveing these tops, a co-worker of mine had tested them.  These are awesome for slowing down the spills and messes and increasing reaction time.  However, that's also the good part about them.  They do 'connect' well to cans and keep smells down, flies from getting in.  Just, it still allows the content to spill out of the lid and can.  What I mean by spills is that the can tips over and the soda (or whatever contents) will still emerge.  These also creat messes during regular use.  I tried using one and the more I drank from it, the more I wore on the front of me.  Great concept, bad execution.",0
This product is very flimsy.  My son likes to stand and shake the gate. One good shake on the joints and it looks like it will fall.  Don't trust this gate not to fall over as he grows bigger and stronger.  We actually bought a new one from Summer Infant and it works great!!,0
I haven't tried any other monitor so I don't know how this performs in comparison to others but I really don't like this one.  It beeps (with a high pitched whine) anytime something or someone walks in between the two monitors. My dog even sets it off.  We have had to resort to hanging the monitors high up on the wall and still it sometimes beeps. I wouldn't recommend it!,0
"Great potty, my son (5 months now) is using it for over a month and he loves it.So easy to do potty training and has a great design for boys :)",1
"This stroller does not have a height adjustment.  I am 5'7 and have to bend a little to push it.  I also find that I kick the wheels a lot when I am walking.  The wheel base is very close together and I have big feet.  If you are average or above average height, you might want to consider a diffrent stroller.",0
This is the BEST baby spoon! The shallow shape is fantastic for when baby is learning to eat for the first time and continues to be easy for baby to eat off of later. I reach for these spoons above all the others in my drawer!,1
"I LOVE my Ergobaby carrier, and use it on a daily basis, probably more than a stroller now.  This is very well made, comfortable and my little girl (6 months) loves riding in it. The design is very thoughtful, and everything has been considered from not having extra strap hanging down (there's an elastic band to tie it up on every adjustable strap) to easy snaps to put a hood up to hold her head when she falls asleep, and the fabric is very soft and a good weight to have my baby in. Right now I only wear it on the front, but I'm looking forward to using a back carry when she gets a little bigger.As far as use goes, I wear it shopping (keeps my cart open for groceries), cooking, cleaning and out for walks. She loves being up high and snuggled in, and is content for much longer periods than when I have her in the high chair or jumper.  Having the Ergo enables me to get so much more done since I can carry her hands free. I would HIGHLY recommend this for all moms of little ones!",1
"This is a beautiful addition to our nursery.  Every time my husband looks at it he comments on how nice it looks.  It wasn't the easiest thing to put together, but I did it by myself at 5 months pregnant in about 2 hours (so it is very possible to do it alone).  There was one piece that just didn't seem to line up with the holes provided and took me a good 30 minutes just to figure out what to do before I finally just strong armed it and it worked.  Like the other reviewers said the drawers are plastic so they don't slide very smoothly so we will need to be careful not to just fling them open.  Also it was much larger than I'd imagined - I was picturing something along the lines of a nightstand but this is the same height as my crib and almost 3 feet wide I believe.  All in all I am very happy with the purchase since I got it on sale and I couldn't be happier with the way it looks.  Workmanship and ease of assembly is pretty good considering the price.  My baby hasn't arrived yet so I cannot comment on functionality or sturdiness, but I love that there's so much storage and the cubby holes make organizing and reaching essentials easy.",1
"Had to get this pump as it was the only one my insurance would cover...have been through 4 pumps at this point, after pumping for 10 months. They get less effective as time goes on. Maybe for the occasional pumper it works, but it has been so frustrating to pump 4 times a day with this thing. The valves are terrible and need replacing constantly, so you need to factor the fact that you will need to buy these at $15/5 every month or so, especially the new kind of valves, which are even more delicate than the previous ones. If I had to do over again, I would probably just pay out of pocket for a Medela. If you notice, most of the positive reviews come from a while ago. I did research recently and found out Ameda changed ownership...maybe this explains the terrible quality. Also, the Ultra isn't worth the extra money. The regular Purely Yours is basically the same, just with less bells and whistles.",0
"Trying to find a static free monitor, we live in San Francisco with lots of people nearby.  Thought this might work but it didn't solve our problem.  Decent monitor but lots of static on both channels",0
Saves the leather in our car AND the only one certified by Britax to actually work in case of an accident G-d forbid.,1
"I was super disappointed in this baby monitor. The only way I am able to hear my baby is if it's sitting 3 inches away from my baby's head. And you can hear static the entire time it's on, even when it's connected to the same channel as the base. Plus I found out that the one in the store is cheaper than this one.",0
Didn't work for us. Bought 5 of these before the baby was born. Tried all of them for a few months and gave up. The bottle leak from under the white plastic. Nothing you can do to stop that. Haven't found a bottle brand yet that didn't leak. Will keep searching :(,0
"It's fine, what can I say? Haven't used any other so no idea what the industry standard is. My only complaints are really minor, not deal breakers but enough to wish on a rating star for.Good news:It appears durable enough, we've been using it about a year now but only for travel, which we don't do all that often.The way it straps on to the back and bottom of a chair feels really secure.Easy to cleanI like that it includes a tray cover to keep the part they eat from clean when travelingWhat could be better:The ""boost"" doesn't go so high, could probably use a bit more height for short kids.The tray is kind of low when babies start to grow a bit, there's not a lot of space between the baby's thighs and the tray. My kid is even on the petite side. I realize part of the point of the booster is to raise the kid to reach the adult table, but sometimes you just don't want 'em there. But overall I imagine a heftier kid than mine would probably start to feel squished in this seat sooner than you'd want.The inner (white) tray snaps off MUCH too easily. I was looking forward to having it both as a spare and to be able to easily bring it to the sink to rinse off, but instead I rarely use it and it's just an extra piece in the way because from the very beginning my 1-year-old could easily pry it off and send food flying. No good.And this is not a problem with the product, in fact it's exactly as described, but I just think people should know this is NOT a full high chair replacement. That would be the excellent ""Space Saver"" booster which I'm about to review. But even though I didn't start my little one on table food until she was able to sit independently anyway, the seat of this booster was still not supportive enough for her at that point (I think she was about 9 months old when we first got this) - she was too little and wiggly and it just wasn't the same as high chair seats usually are more contoured. The tray is small too, which is perfect for travel and toddlers but not ideal for beginning eaters who don't yet understand how to keep their food in one place.Overall, this is an item that I'm very happy to have in my car trunk, but for home I'd probably get a more basic booster when my kid outgrows the high chair. The trays would be squashing her legs by that point and the boost isn't so high, I think most plainer seats would do the job very well or better for home. But for traveling with a baby to toddler, it's near perfect.",1
"I had a blue one of these for my first few kids years ago. Just bought this one to replace it for my daughter who will be born soon. It's the same one...different color. I didn't care to try the pricey ones with all kinds of features. This one worked just fine and I was happy with it. I'm sure I will be again. One side is perfect for babies, the other for toddlers. Easy to keep clean. Cheap and works great. Couldn't ask for more from a baby tub.",1
"I love this hamper. Its not only cute and matches my baby's bedding, but its functional. It has a mesh liner inside that is easily removable which allows me to tote the laundry downstairs to the washer. I actually appreciate the comments from the other posting, and I avoided placing the the items in the dryer. I washed everything and allowed it to air dry and it fit nicely back onto the wooden hamper stand. Excellent Product!",1
"This book is sooo cute, however I'm worried about the longevity from the sounds it makes when I open it. Also, a decorative border on the front cover fell off right away, though a little glue will probably fix it.",1
"I have used the NoJo babyslings for 10 years and love them. From brand new infant to toddler sized children, they are easy to use and easy to clean. I highly recomend them!",1
I used this one because I was too scared to use the nail clippers the hospital gave me. For the first couple of weeks it was fine but once I tried the nail clippers I realized that it was just much easier with the nail clippers. You should try using the nail clippers first and then buy the scissors if you feel you still need it,0
I love these for taking pre-measured formula with us.  I used them with the older kids and they were the first thing I looked for when I found out we were having another baby.,1
I bought this for an extra room in my house that I was fixing up. It's a nice little touch to the room and adds just a little spice to the room.,1
"This was a replacement for a slightly older model that was broken, by a now 18 month old.  The older model had tilt etc. and worked really well, but this model has a nicer monitor and the camera is quieter if you have to remotely move the view.  So far a great improvement on an already nice product.  Everyone with a young child should have one of these.",1
I purchased this as a gift for a shower.  My friend loved it and looks forward to using it.  It shipped fast too.,1
"We bought this for our then-18 month-old son to get him accustomed to the idea of potty training.  He's nearly 21 months old now and still hasn't actually used the toilet, but he always sits on it when one of us goes to the bathroom.  So, we'll see how the next few months go.  At least the songs are catchy!",1
"Very sturdy brush, stand is solid so when brush is placed in to dry it doesn't just fall over easily. We don't use these very long because of germ build up, but this was a good price for a well built product. Colors are bright and pretty.",1
I thought I bought this a little too early but he is starting to get the idea This was a great buy,1
"We bought this one to keep the dogs on the tile and off the carpet when we are out. We like it so much we bought another one for the bottom of the stairs.  It is very nice, easy to install, easy to operate. It looks professionally installed, doesn't look like an expansion gate, but it is!The opening is a little narrow but no big deal for us.  Great value for the price.",1
We just got this stroller in last month. Love it. One of our best purchases for the baby. I spent months research umbrella strollers. I made a great choice! It is stylish but pratical too. It is a must!,1
GAVE THIS FOR A BABY SHOWER AND SHE WAS IN LOVE FROM THE SECOND SHE OPENED IT! MUST SAY IT WAS A GREAT BUY!,1
These do exactly as advertised but in my opinion they aren't necessary its just something else that I have to clean and keep up with. My kids drink out of their pouches without a problem with is hurting their mouths.,0
Love them. Donot even invest on the smaller size. I just started solids for my 5month old and this size is perfect.I would highly recommend them. been thru several washes in the dishwasher and works fine in microwave.lids are great,1
"Years ago it was common for babies to sleep on their stomach, but with the rise of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) parents are told to have their babies sleep on their backs.  As a result many babies develop a flat spot on the back of their head.  It's not harmful to development, but looks a bit odd and can worry parents.  I had this problem with my baby and with a month of using this pillow  began to notice a difference.  This is a great product.",1
"I have not used this product yet but the price was right, the quality of the product looks good, and I am looking forward to seeing the result of its use.",1
"it's not easy to find a bottle with a straw and a cap, but this one is such. Pretty sturdy, relatively easy to wash.",1
"I was a little nervous about this purchase, since I saw so many reviews indicating that it wasn't the same as the original base that comes with the Snugride 30 Classic Connect (we purchased the Dragonfly design), with complaints about it not really being compatible and the lack of a level in the base. I just got mine this week and it was manufactured in July 2013 - I can report that it is EXACTLY the same as my original base and works just fine. It has a level and the seat connects to it without any issues. Maybe last year there were some sub-par bases around, but I can report that I got exactly what I wanted, which is a duplicate base for our new Snugride 30.",1
"We love this active cup. My daughter finally is off the bottle because this was the perfect transition cup. A friend of mine told me about it and I had a difficult time finding it in the stores, but no problem finding it on amazon!!! My daught used it to drink her milk from. Thank you NUK!!!!",1
There's not much to say here.  This product is exactly as described.  The quality is considered to be good and it was fairly easy to put together.  I would definitely recommend this product.,1
"I bought this as a travel stroller two years ago, to save room in the car when traveling/running errand. It worked great! It has many miles on it. Compact fold, reclines just enough for child to nap in. It has a great parent ""bag"" by the handle, that zips. The under neath storage is useless. The wheels did squeak about 6m after I started using it, I was told to use lithium grease, and it took the squeak away. My biggest complaint is, ours broke while away on vacation. The rivet gave away on the bottom ""X"" fold of stroller. I contacted company, (they have fast and friendly service) they told me there is only a one year warranty on it. So I decided to run a screw through it to hold it together, I hope we are able to use it for a little while longer. I really like this stroller.",0
"It didn't come with the bottles,  It didn't say. I had to buy them separate.  Didn't like that. Should have indicated.",1
"I bought this stroller in March just before the birth of our little one.  My older daughter has just turned three and is pretty small for her age.  When we finally put the stroller together to use we realized that with the infant seat attached, there is no room for our daughter to sit or stand (which is the purpose of the stroller am I wrong?)  The basket is almost inaccessible once the little ones are using the stroller.  I might hold onto it for use once my newbie is old enough to sit up on her own, but really seems WAY too small for two kiddos.",0
I appreciated the reviews written by others regarding this item and learned others used it in a 30 gallon trash can which kept me from buying an unnecessary diaper pail. These work great. I bought two and wash one with each load of cloth diapers.,1
"I ordered 2, with different names and they were both perfect. Exactly as described. I had it personalized with first and middle names about 14 letters total on each one. How can you pass these up for the price.",1
"Originally bought this as a filler bc the tub I wanted was on back order & this was inexpensive. After the first use I cancelled the other tub. This product is awesome. Affordable, durable and my baby has Ben using it since 6 weeks!  She LOVES it",1
"This is the best bathing product I have ever used for my kids.  Its so simple to use, everything is all in one spot and you never have to take your eyes off of your baby. I was given a free sample of this product to review. However, my thoughts and opinions are my own.  I will use this for my nexy baby too...Awesome!!",1
"Thought this was a good idea but there are a few issues.Washing re-usable plastic containers is easier than washing this pouch.If anything gets on the pouch, it tends to seep through (ketchup, etc...)It's a neat idea but I say to just stick with the zip-loc containers.",0
"We tried these for a week and just couldn't get our 5-month old to accept them. He would suck so hard on these that the nipple would collapse and then he'd start to complain. We tried the slow and medium-flow nipples with the same results. The only solution would be to open/loosen the cap up a little bit and that defeated the whole purpose of these ""air-bubble-free"" bottles.On the plus side they do clean-up easy and fit our bottle warmer nicely.BTW, we have had the best results with the Medela Breastmilk Bottles and ""S"" flow nipples. Simple design, good value, and no issues to date.",0
"Bottom line: Love the gate. Takes time to learn how to put it up, but easy to use once figured out. Its lifespan is probably only about 2 years (of near-constant use) unless you have someone handy (and competent) with tools in the house.We bought this soft gate to use in an extra-wide opening to our kitchen. It has worked wonderfully. Once you get the hang of putting it up, it's easy, though it does take a bit of effort. I had a bit of a hard time stepping over the gate (which the instructions say not to do, but whatever) because I am fairly short (5'2""). After about 2 years of near-constant use the top locking pin broke. We thought the gate was garbage until my husband figured out that he could drill a hole in the releasing lever and put a screw through it to create a new pin. This took a bit of work since the cloth cover is not remove-able. A few months later, the lower locking pin broke and my husband did the same thing. The gate now works even better than before! Now I just wish I could wash the cover more thoroughly.",1
"I got this for my 3 year old and it fits perfectly in his car seat cup holder. A bit too perfect, in fact, it's gotten stuck before. The flip lid doesn't feel secure enough to me. I feel like it could easily get knocked open inside his backpack and spill the contents everywhere. Otherwise, I like the design of it. My 3 year old can't open it by himself (yet) so that's a plus.",0
"this is not very loud and has no volume control and you can't press the individual number buttons.  It just plays the same things for #1-3, #4-6 & #7-9.  Having said that, my little baby girl still enjoys it.",0
"I bought this on the recommendation of a friend (who I think would give this 5 stars). We were looking for something to bring diapers to/from daycare, and this is what she uses. I especially liked the idea of not having to wash a wetbag every few days, so we went for it and ordered the nappy bucket. The size is about as I expected from the second photo, if not a little bit bigger. There were so many reviews about it being small, so I actually expected it to be smaller... It IS definitely small compared to most regular diaper pails but I think you could easily fit a day's worth of cloth diapers in here. We use BumGenius 4.0s for daycare and Flips at home. Out of curiosity I just filled it up with clean Flip inserts (mix of the cotton and stay dry, no covers) and I fit 15. Realistically you'd have some covers so the reviewer who said 12 was probably about right. I haven't tried with the 4.0s but I would estimate it would fit 7 or 8. So, depending on what kind of diapers you use, I think it would be adequate if you're washing every day, or maybe every other if you have an older baby going through fewer diapers.As others have mentioned, the lid doesn't really ""lock"" very well. Basically, when the handle is flipped to one side you can't take the lid off. But any older kid could easily flip the handle over - it turns very easily. (so, it might be safe from a baby but not at a daycare with kids of all ages). If that's your plan, might want to see where they (or you) will keep the bucket and if the locking lid is an important feature or not.Overall, I think it's a great little bucket, especially if you're looking for something compact, easy to carry, and are going to wash more frequently. But despite my 4-star review, I am returning it. It was much, much bigger than I wanted just to bring to/from daycare (where she only goes through about 3 diapers). I ordered and just started using a medium Bummis Fabulous Wetbag because they dry faster than the Planet Wise bags we already had.",1
"I resisted buying this for a long time, questioning whether it was really necessary. I always figured that if it was so important, Britax would've sold it along with the carrier itself.  Well, our daughter was over the weight limit for the infant insert and with an overseas travel pending, I figured to finally give in and give it a try. Worse comes to worse, I would've just returned it and at least satisfy the curiosity.Upon receiving it though I could immediately tell the difference in weight distribution. The carrier was already pretty comfortable to begin with but with this extender it gets even better! Our daughter seems a lot more comfortable in it too! The fact that it doesn't add more bulk to the carrier is also a plus - looks a lot sleeker than other carriers, in my opinion.It's a bit of a pain that Britax doesn't just sell this along with the carrier but for $20+, it's not too bad. Well worth all the money given how often we use the carrier and how much more comfortable it makes it as the child grows and gets heavier. I would definitely recommend this item.",1
"I have been using this bouncer seat for two months and overall, it is nice, we use it daily, and the colors & design are nice to look at.  With that said, I have owned a different Comfort & Harmony bouncer with my oldest child and there are features of that seat that this does not have, and I'd like to point them out because I find it annoying to not have them.  I did not realize it had different features when I ordered it.-The seat does not recline.  In other models, there are buttons on the side and you can either recline the seat for newborns, or sit them up for when they are a little older. I had to cushion around my child's head and behind her back for support because her head would roll forward.  I really miss the option to recline her back.-The bar overhead does move back so you can take baby out, but it doesn't stay back.  I think it is spring loaded or something because it always comes back forward and gets in the way of taking baby out.  I have to take the bar off every time I take baby out.  Minor, but still an annoyance in comparison.I would recommend this brand of bouncer seat, but not this particular one.  Look for these features!",0
"I have been through 5 different brands of nursing pads in order to find ones I could live with. These pads are my favorite. They are soooo soft and don't show much through clothing. They require a little extra prep (three times washed & dried, hot water, non-enzyme detergent) before the first time you use them, but have washed well on repeated uses. They do tend to bunch up a bit in the dryer, but I've found they smooth out pretty quickly once they are in place.I am not a big leaker, but have had no problems with absorbency. Usually I can't even tell if they got wet, except they are heavier at the end of the day than they were at the beginning.",1
"The puj flyte is a great baby bathtub for many reasons.- Its small. (I agree with some of the other reviews about ease of storage.)- It fits into a sink. (We have a newer more modern sink & it fits into it pretty good, but prob not as well as it does more traditional sinks.  This helps so u don't have to bend over.)- It holds baby better than the larger tubs.  (I tried several of the traditional baby bath tubs with my 1st 2 children but they never liked any of them bc they always felt like they were going to fall bc they didn't feel like they were being held.)Once you fill it up make sure not to put baby in too quickly or you will splash water all over the floor.We purchased the puj flyte on another website & it was way cheaper.The main reason I don't like this tub (It's kinda a deal breaker too bc I'm going to try the blossom bath) is bc baby slides down.  I wish they would have put something nonslip in the bottom.  My baby ends up being stuck in a position were his neck looks uncomfortable & could possibly be difficult to breath.  It also makes it difficult to wash his hair.  I'll put him back in the better position about an inch or so higher up & if I don't hold him he slides right back in that position.  I've tried putting a washcloth in the bottom but he still slides.  Maybe if I put a folded hand towel underneath his bottom but then I would have to deal with a soaked towel after each bath & since the puj flyte is small it will prob take up needed room.",0
while I love the lil froggy - and it's rattle inside - it was far smaller than I expected - though the quality and cuteness totally made up for that!,1
Great thermometer for your little one.  The only thing I do not like is that you have to dry off the bottom completely or it will stay on after you take it out of the water.,1
"Got this as a replacement for my 4 month old son, as he was in an Eddie Bauer carseat no longer big enough. As soon as we got it open it really did wow me and my wife. The safety features are amazing, and the build of this item was just as pristine. Only drawbacks is that it is pretty difficult to place in the car compared to a regular carseat and that if you plan on taking it out, thats a process as well. Also, its quite large for certain vehicles when your rear facing, and I drive an 09 Maximathat is fairly spacey. But with Boulevard 70, there won't be the ample amount of space you were used to with your previous carseat. Despite the cons, it easily brands itself a name of superiority with its easy alteration features for size and width. comfort from all sides including side impact and easy snap seatbelts, and it finishes itself off with a sleek sporty look (Onyx). All in all, safety features, build quality, comfort, durability, all at a 5 star rating, great carseat, good for along time, thanks Britax.",1
This adapter is great and fits well with our bob stroller and with our carseat...biggest thing before buying this product was to make sure it was for the newest bob and not the older ones.,1
"It's a very good chair  ,my baby loves it so much.I can have more time to do other thing when baby sit in the chair.thanks Amazon...........................",1
"When expecting our first kid, my only buggy requirements were that it was simple, that it could fit into our tiny car and that I could retain my man-card when pushing it in public. We settled on the Mountain Buggy Swift which easily fulfilled all three of my pre-child, narrow-minded requirements.Since now understanding what it means to have a kid, my buggy requirements have changed slightly.New musts:Easy to manoeuvre (so grand parents can take kid out for long walks without parents being present).Kid comfortable and likes being in buggy (bugger carrying a kid around who refuses to be in the buggy as well as pushing their stroller and all the other bits they need to get through a basic outing).Somewhere to store all the other bits the kid needs to get through a basic outing (it is insane to think there was a time pre-kid where I just carried a wallet when I left the house).Food, sick and juice dont automatically ruin buggy (surely no explanation needed here...).The Swift fortunately nails all these new must haves as well and is easily the best stroller I have pushed to date. This may have been somewhat of a fluke purchase to end up with a product which does much more than anticipated, but when we recommend it to friends, we claim to have done our research.If you dont know what having a kid really means, the Swift is a safe bet buggy.",1
"My son loves this 3 piece dinnerware set, it def. was a success very durable and there hasn't been any fading niether",1
My 3 Month old son loves bouncy seats we have four of them so when I found this one I couldn't wait to buy it.  I thought it would be great with 3 vib setting and many learning settings with a magic mirror.  Boy was I ever dissapointed the vol setting is way too low and the magic mirror is a joke.  Every time I put my son in it he cries!!!  Stick with fisher-price!!!!,0
"I love that we didn't have to use tools to mount this onto our stairway. It's easy to open and close, sturdy and great. Highly recommend!",1
The kneeling pad is good.but like so many have said...the bathmat doesn't stick.we tried a number of different ways...it doesn't work.,0
I love it that I can get what I wanted from my daughter. I have prime and got it sooner than I was told. My daughter loves it!,1
The Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad was shipped promptly after ordering it and subsequently arrived a couple of weeks later in good condition. Looks great!,1
"If you have a house-load of electronic gadgetry, this is the monitor for you!After 14 months of daily use, I can wholeheartedly recommend this product.  My wife and I often ask ourselves whether or not some baby products are even given to parents to test, because we find faults with most baby products within a few days of actually using them.But this monitor works as advertised.Never any interference or static.  In 14 months we haven't heard so much as a pop or click from interference and we have wireless internet, wireless phones, fluorescent lights, 5 computers, a microwave oven, wireless stereo speakers and many other gadgets that typically interfere with other wireless devices.The rechargeable batteries that come with it are a bit cheesy and had to be replaced after about 3 months, but fortunately they are plain old AAA rechargeables.  After replacing them with a good set of name brand rechargeable batteries, this unit can run for well over 8 hours on a single charge and can still do it nearly a year after replacing the batteries!The transmitter is VERY sensitive. You can hear your baby's arm slide across the crib sheets! And the receiver is loud enough to compete with the television or a kitchen-load of company.  The range is also very good. I can walk out to the mailbox (about 150 feet from the house) and still hear the baby upstairs with no interference.One last great feature is that the receiver will beep loudly if it loses the signal from the baby's room.  So you can rest assured that just because there is no noise, does not mean you have lost the signal!For those who say the volume is not loud enough: in an otherwise quiet house, when we are up in the baby's room making noise, we can hear the noise coming out of the receiver (downstairs) from up in the baby's room.  Loud enough?",1
Baby enjoys playing with the cups but only 2 of them have small enough holes to function well in the bath. The rest of the cups have too many or too large of holes to hold water long enough for Baby to watch the water drain. So we use the rest of the cups outside the tub for tummy time and such.,0
I have used this towel for a couple of months and it is pretty good.  It is slightly bigger than your average newborn hooded towels and a little more absorbent than them too.  The design is really cute and the print on the towel will give your baby something more to look at.  However the lovable friends hooded towels (not the three pack) that they sell individually are slightly bigger for toddler use too and a little more absorbent as well.  I might recommend this if the other is sold out.,1
"PROS:1. Inconspicuous2. Let Down starts in the first 2 minutes3. QUICK - 15 max mins per breast4. Can pump two breast at a time5. Plenty of accessories to start with (and spares)6. Durable (this bag has been with me everywhere, including travel and still holding strong)7. Can be used in a CAR with the attachementCONS:1. Not very quiet (I use cloth to reduce the noise)",1
I wanted to give this a 5 star rating because I love all of our a&a baby gear but unfortunately the zipper on this began to separate after just a couple of uses. Otherwise though I love the muslin material which is soft and light weight and I my baby sleeps great in it!,1
"This product serves its function very well, easy use, maybe a bit overpriced for a cloth cover for a seat, but it is what it is. It is a good product, and it works for what my wife wanted it for, it just seems like one of those things that you may not really need, but if you want a product like this, it is worth it's price.",1
"It's comfortable and easy to use. The user guide is clear, it's not too heavy and the price is according to the quality",1
"This is the only carrier my wife and I have tried.The purchase was based on reviews on Amazon.I am 5-9 160 lbs and it fits me with lots of room to go.I can feel the pressure of the support being transferred to my  back and rib cage evenly making it nice and snug.Our daughter was almost 10lbs @ birth and we have been using this since she was a month old.  Obviously having 10-15lbs hanging off your chest can get tiring eventually.  I have used this for an hour before I had to take a break.The baby loves it.  She is comfortable, gets in and out easily, and I think she enjoys the eye level and front facing position to the world.The price is steep.  As stated in another review the ROI is nil.Having your baby strapped to you while you run around doing errands or shopping is really awesome.",1
"I bought this to keep my puppy in as an alternative to crating when I'm not home.  She has more room to play and roam, and use a puppy pad if necessary.  It's rather hard to open and manuver on your own, two people are definitely needed.",1
"I bought a Avent microwave sterilizer two months ago. It works fine, but we need to take it down to kitchen whenever we sterilize bottles and nipples. After reading customer reviews in this site, we decided to try this iQ24. It's really a great product. My wife loves it. However, there is no significant difference between iQ24 and microwave if you don't care about convenience and organic.",1
"My baby is still struggling with solids but loves to make a mess. These bibs are a life saver! I used to have to change him after every feeding but now he makes his mess and is totally protected from it. The rest just drips into the base. I unclip the bibs, rise them off and we are good to go!",1
"I have fallen in love with this product. I have a two week old and already have 200+ ounces in e freezer. It is a little bulky but those first few weeks you're just at home anyways. I don't have a problem with the price, only because of the amount I've been able to save in such a short amount of time. I would highly recommend this to nursing moms.",1
"The Fast Table chair by Inglesina is fantastic for my Grandson.  It is easy to set up on our island counter, our dining table and at restuarants.  It folds up and is easy to transport and store. I may have to get another one for our Grand Daughter.",1
"I purchased this Ride On Board after reading two other reviews that this works with the Combi Twin Sport Stroller. I can verify that those two reviewers were correct. It works great! I have a 3.5 year old, 18 month old, and will have a new baby arriving in about a month. I was not interested in triple strollers. They are so big and bulky. Also, my 3.5 year old is perfectly capable of walking at his age. But I understand that he won't always want to. That's what interested me in this Ride On Board.Installation:It took me (at 8 months pregnant) about 15 minutes to put together and install. The instructions aren't the greatest, but it's not hard to figure out from the pictures provided. I installed it on the left side of the Combi. The reason for this is the infant carseat can only go on the right. When the infant carseat is attached, the seat must be reclined, which will be right in the child's face who is riding on the Ride On Board. I don't think attaching it to the right side would be a good idea unless you do not plan to recline that seat. My 18 month old will be in the left seat, so I'm fine with not reclining it. There is plenty of room for the diaper bag to hang on my side (I have posted a photo of this in the user photos.)Storage & Removal:It's not difficult to remove. You can still fold the Combi without removing the Ride On Board attachments that are now installed on the stroller. You cannot fold the Combi with the board completely attached. There is a strap included to fold the Ride On Board upward and store it that way. This won't work if you want to fold the Combi, but if your child decides they want to walk and you don't want this in your way when you're walking in the middle of the stroller, the strap is nice for that.Overall I am very glad I purchased this item. I think it's going to be a great addition to our double stroller so that we do not need a triple stroller.",1
I LOVE this pillow. I discovered it at my son's daycare. I purchased one for us and I absolutely loved it! We are expecting our second and I'm so glad I will have this for the babies early months. This pillow came in so handy. It was great for putting on our bed in our room when I was folding laundry or watching tv. It keeps the baby surrounded and sunken in a little. I purchased this one as a gift. I hope my friend loves it as much as I have.,1
I have a duck themed bathroom and this set is a great addition to my Christmas decorations for it. I had to look close at first to figure out what each piece was but my kids knew right away. I love that I can set these out for decoration and not worry about when my kids start to play with them.,1
"Yes, a little small, but any Dora fan will love these.  Just got these for my 2 year old daughter, who is a Dora fanatic. A good addition to our growing collection of Dora toys.",1
"I started to get my daughter some bath toys when she was around 6 months old and was sitting up in the tub on her own, outside of the baby tub.  She loves this book!  It's very easy for her to grab onto with the seahorse, and sometimes when she's laying in the water she can even hook the string with her foot and pick it up that way.  She also likes to gum the seahorse when she's teething.  It always dries easily and she still enjoys playing with it after 2+ months.  Good purchase!",1
"If you want your 15m old to walk around the house and create milk puddles everywhere then this is the bottle for you!  I've never had a bottle/sippy leak sooo bad.  We've always been a klean kanteen family so I'm going to stick with those bottles with a MAM nipple.  The only thing that the Pura bottle has going for it is the cool factor, and forget about those silicone grip covers, they are impossible to get on and off!",0
"I was a little worried that these wouldn't work with my old BOB trailer since I bought it ten years ago, but the design hasn't changed and they fit perfectly. Now I have more than I anticipate ever needing, but I'm glad to have some extra.Also, note that while Amazon considers this a ""baby product"" I bought the pins for my bicycle trailer, not for a stroller. I don't know if they are useful for any of the stollers or not (what would they be for?) but they are just what you need for the trailers.",1
I like the warmer...small and warms the wipes but the minute you take them out they lose the warmness.  But it works ok...,1
is it just me or does the insides of these bottles smells like bubble gum? great value for your money. they dont leak and the colours are eye catching for your baby! would recommend to anyone!,1
"Through a series of unfortunate events, I've come to own six different manual breast pumps and two electric ones. My manuals include the Lansinoh, the Medela Harmony and two generations of Avent pumps.  This is how they compare (from worst to best):(1)Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump. I own the Freestyle, so I thought that I would like the Medela brand manual. Not so. The valve system on this pump is a thin flip attached to hard plastic. It simply does not generate as much suction as the sturdier Lansinoh and Avent valves, and therefore it does not trigger let down as well or get as much milk. If this is the only pump you have, you might not realize it, because you will still get some milk, but when I compared it to my Avent, it was taking about five minutes longer and getting an ounce less per breast. I liked that you could switch out the breast cup to accommodate different nipple sizes, and assembly was slightly easier, but it does not have the ""massage cushion"" which makes it a little less comfortable. Of course, the lack of cushion also means that milk can't get stuck in the cushion and leak like the other three pumps, so it's good and bad. But the bottom line is that I have supply problems, so I just couldn't settle for a pump that generated less milk. It's in the garbage now.(2)Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump(aka the Older Model Avent). These pumps are comfortable to use and generate a lot of milk, but the valve system is a small dime sized piece of plastic that pops out while pumping and easily gets lost. Fortunately, you can now buy replacement valves that are inch long pieces of sturdy, flexible plastic. Those are a must for Avent users.Philips AVENT Comfort Breast Pump Valves. Also, even though I like this pump, it is annoying that it collects milk in the cushion and drips out easily. It shares this problem with the newer Comfort Avent, and the Lansinoh, but not the Medela, which does not have cushion.(3)Lansinoh Manual Breast Pump, 1-Count. This pump is cheaper than the Avent, and uses the same type of valve, so unlike the Medela, it is almost as effective as the Avent at getting milk. It also takes standard size bottles, including Medela, Even-flo, etc, which is an advantage if you don't already use Avent bottles. Still, I prefer the Avent for two reasons: first, the massage cushion on the Avent has ""petal"" air pockets that I like, and second, the Lansinoh takes much more effort to pump. My hand gets tired within five or ten minutes of using this pump, which is not a problem I've had with either the Medela or Avent pumps. I think it is because the diaphragm on the Lansinoh is much thicker. So, well, I can see certain advantages to this Lansinoh (cost, bottles), it's not my favorite.(4)Philips Avent Manual Comfort Breast Pump(aka the Newer Model Avent). These pumps are the best.  The most comfortable to use, the short neck can be placed right next to the breast. They also get the most milk without making my hand tired. The only disadvantages are that they are somewhat harder to assemble than the Medela and can't accommodate different nipple sizes, cost more than the Lansinoh and require special Avent shaped bottles (usually included). Still, the assembly difference is small, and I can learn to control milk dripping from the cushion. Comfort and milk matter most to me, so I enjoy this pump the most. If, heaven forbid, I need a seventh breast pump, I will buy another one of these.",0
This is a basic video monitor that works very well for the price. We have a three story house and this works when we're in the basement and our son is on the top floor. The picture and the audio are very clear. I had a more expensive video monitor with my first child that didn't have this range. I've recommended this to several friends.,1
"I am on a very tight budget but I needed a breast pump to facilitate taking a medication I had to pump and dump afterwards. I bought this pump and within the 4-5 time of using it, it stoped suctioning. Having read the reviews I see now I bought a terrible product and worse yet I do not have the money to even concider a new electric one or even a higher end manual. I've actually had to postpone resuming my medication until I can save enough for a new 'effective' pump. I hope others get a chance to read this and save their money! Shame on the company for putting out such a terrible product!!! I will be stearing clear of all nuk products from now on.",0
"This is perfect for the winter weather.  When combined with my body heat, it keeps my very tall 11 month old nice and snuggly.  Love it.",1
"I am delighted to find this gate at the taller heighth. Like we did many years ago, we are using it to keep a puppy on a tile floor when we are not watching. It is fairly basic, but is portable and mounts securely with pressure to both a standard doorway and a hallway. As our Golden continues to grow in heighth and weight, we believe this will work. He does not try to chew through the plastic coated mesh wire.  Way to go Amazon, for offering an improved (taller and wider sized) basic product at a reasonable price.",1
Works for what it's made to dowould give 5 stars exceptWhenever you lift the rail to close it all the way sometimes it comes open too far and gets to be quite annoying to get back in placeWish they had lock set up so it can't open too much like this and become stuck in the wrong position so that you can't open it with out fidgeting with it for a while.,1
We use it with the pressure mount and its pretty strong.  door opening a little narrow but its ok.  looks nice,1
"My picky, sippy-cup-boycotting 11 month old is using this like a champ.  Finally, we have a winner.  We have tried so many and this is the one he will take.  As long as the extra tab covers the spout on the inside, it does not leak.  We have a ceramic tile floor, and sometimes he can drop it hard enough to dislodge the inner tab and then it's leaky.  Simply replacing the tab resolves the issue.  It is very easy to clean, which is a huge plus.",1
"baby like it,but the mat is not cotton,,i think cotton is better for baby and the light is a little shine for the baby's fragile eyes",1
We purchased this monitor because of its other positive ratings and we are very pleased with it.  Great picture quality and sound.,1
"We have two children and two seats and so bought two of these bags. Worked beautifully. Fit our Britax Boulevard as well as Advocate, which is so huge I had my doubts about it fitting any bag at all. Looks brand new still after our first round trip. Looks sturdy and looks like it would last for years. So thankful for the wheels, it is worth the extra dollars. Highly recommend this. Incidentally, we also bought the Childress Ultimate Car Seat Bag. The Britax bag is better.UPDATE: I returned both bags. Turns out that the bags are not at all road worthy. I was putting them away for storage when I realized that there are multiple rips in the lower front area of the bag. I'm not talking about the bottom, where the bag come in contact with the ground. At first I thought it was just one of the bags, but it turned out that both bags have holes and rips. I was really disappointed since I really liked the bags. The rips are such that they would probably not last a second trip. We didn't even check in the bags. They were gate checked! Anyhow, so much for it lasting a few years. I sent them back to Amazon and I hope they honor the return.",0
"This is a great little compact stroller.  It has plenty of storage, is fairly adjustable, and extremely affordable.  If you do not like umbrella style strollers, but needs something that takes up very little room when folded, or to navigate in tight spots, than this is for you.  I do wish the handle was a little higher ( I am 6' tall, and find it could be an inch or two higher).  It is very easy to fold with one hand.  I believe there is a slightly newer version in blue, that lacks the &#34;saddle bags&#34; (which we have never used anyway) and has a slightly larger (more foward coverage) canopy.",1
"This worked out nicely at first.  Although I only gave it 4 stars, because my daughter seems to be comfortable in it for only 2-3 months.  The netting for the tub is very helpful(which you only use the first few weeks), and stress relieving for new parents with a slippery newborn.  It worked well, while it did.",1
"Fits bugaboo cameleon FIRST series perfectly! Bugaboo website said it was a good fit for ALL cameleons and it delivered. I love the extended canopy, the baby would be perfectly covered from the sun shade!!",1
"When we found out we were pregnant, my husband and I were of the same mind regarding baby gear: no gimmicks, only the necessities. We also agreed (mostly) on budget. Our baby girl is now 5 months old and I think the Chicco Cortina Travel System is one of the best purchases we've made thus far.Sticker shock comes to mind when I remember shopping for strollers. $700? For just a stroller?? Really?!?? Given that most families invest in at least two different strollers over time, and will definitely be buying at least two car seats, we weren't prepared to go down that road. The Chicco Cortina Travel System has been a wonderful and affordable solution. Granted, it might not be as sexy as some of the more expensive options, but both the car seat and the stroller are quality products - certainly miles ahead of many low-end brands (like the Graco I borrowed when out of town recently).Safety features aside -- which are all there -- this is what I like or what I would ideally change about the Chicco Cortina:PROS:- Car seat is SUPER EASY to click in and out of its base, as well as in and out of the stroller- Stroller has adjustable push handle (great for parents of all heights)- Stroller is easy to fold and unfold- Stroller stands on its own when folded- Decent size undercarriage basket (definitely easier to access when stroller seat is upright, but even with the seat down, I don't find it to be any more cumbersome than most other stroller baskets)- All car seat padding is removable and machine washable- Stroller comes standard with two cup holders, one of which has a secure lid and is a great place to keep keys handy and safe- Stroller supports the weight of a diaper bag when strapped across the push handle (I've never experienced the stroller becoming wobbly or unstable with a diaper bag on it)CONS:- Stroller is a bit bulky and takes up our entire trunk space (VW Tiguan), but then again, this is a full-size stroller so it's to be expected- The ""plastic viewing window"" on top of the stroller serves no purpose. There's a mesh design that obstructs any real view of your child, and it ends up being an annoying little spot for sunlight to shine in on the baby. On sunny days, we tend to throw something over the window.All in all, very happy with this product. We're especially pleased that we didn't have to spend a fortune on two of the most basic baby necessities, yet don't feel like we sacrificed quality. In fact, we're so happy with our Chicco Cortina that we recently purchased the Chicco Liteway umbrella for when we graduate into exclusive stroller use (no more car seat).",1
"I have been using this stroller for 9 months and so far, very satisfied with my purchase. I had been researching for 2 months for a stroller which was lightweight and was capable to use with my Graco infant seat, and this stroller had it.  After using this stroller for 9 months, this is what I found:Pros- Smooth ride and easy to steer even with one hand.- Its lightweight which is good when putting it in and taking it out of the car.- Seat is well padded and can recline into a flat position for my baby to sleep in.- Its quite compact, can bring it into restaurants without taking a lot of space.- Easy access to the basket.Cons- Canopy doesn't extend enough to provide good shade coverage.- Universal adaptor for infant car seat doesn't seem to be too secure (its just a buckle strap that keeps the car  seat in place with the stroller) even though I've had no problems with it so far.- Its hard to snap the seat into the stroller frame at times, need to try a few times as the seat fabric gets in the way.Overall, I'm pretty happy with this stroller and would recommend buying this stroller if you don't want to spend big bucks on a higher-end stroller.",1
"While not complicated, but I've used easier-to-use baby carriers.The advantage of this one is the the baby and I are both more comfortable.Another nice thing is that it doesn't get too hot.I would highly recommend it but I wish it (well all brands/models) were easier to put on and off.",1
"Nighty Night Nursing Light was a life saver for me! I received this product as a sample to review and I fell in love. As a new mother, I was unsure of how nightly feedings would go, and this product made them extremely easy! Once its clipped on it is hands free which makes latching the baby on in the dark a breeze. The light is bright enough to see, but dim enough to not wake up a sleeping baby or husband. I also love how simple it is to turn on. Just one little click and its on. The vibrate setting is great as well. It vibrates to wake you if you happen to doze off. My favorite however is the timer setting of the light. You can chose 5, 10, 15 or 20 minutes. After the selected time, the light turns off on its own. I always have it on the 20 minute setting. Its great not having to worry about turning it off on you own, in case you do fall asleep. I can't imagine nights without this product. I use it every night, multiple times a night and I would recommend this to every nursing mom",1
Absolutely LOVE this product!!  Wish I had had one for my other 3 children.  We live in cold and windy North Dakota and this is just so easy to use.  There have been times my little one has gotten too hot when I over bundle him in it.  I recommend this to any one expecting a little one in the winter months.,1
"I purchased this for my daughter's 3 month old and she raves about it.  Went to visit friends with two infants and they all wanted one... Perfect for Beach, pool or just a stroll... good sun or bugs protection.",1
"I found this carrier to be safe and easy to use but my daughter, who at 5 months is over 20 pounds, is outgrowing it.  Most people will be able to use it much longer than we will.  It provided head support when she was a newborn and now that she is bigger she enjoys facing out and seeing the world. At this size the top folds down and she can experience the outdoors as I let her touch trees, for example.  All in all a great product.  If they come out with one adjustable up to 40 pounds I'll be first in line.",1
"These worked very well, but slipped a few times down the bar when I bumped into something (large heavy bag that stuck out the side).I usually do not hang large heavy bags but ended up with adding heavy backpack on a LONG walk.  Very happy that the hook stood up to the heavy load. Would purchase again if needed. Allowed me to bring much more along.",1
This towel is a Little smaller than I expected but very cute. It was a gift and they loved it.,1
"My 3-month-old is totally enamored with this toy. When he wakes up, he stares at it, waiting for us to turn on the lights and motion. He's quite happy kicking and watching it go for long periods. It was easy to put together (you'll need a screwdriver) and the batteries seem to be surviving well. The animals are most easily visible from the side, but the baby can see their brightly colored and patterned sides and seems to like that quite a bit.The Amazon product description currently says it has elephants on the base. This isn't right. The picture, with lions, is the item you're buying.",1
This is the best pump I have ever gotten. The suction is much better than any pump I have tried. And it travels well.,1
This is the second blanket like this we have bought.  It's my daughters favorite! So we needed a back up.,1
"It's a great chair. It rolls great. Has 3 positions. However, the directions for putting this together were very unclear and unprofessionally written. I put the chair facing backward and it didn't align with the screw holes on the base. I had to remove it and install it again the other way. 10 Minute job turned into 1 hour cause of poor instructions.",1
"Love this seat. I used it for my now 18 month old and have bought one for my sister and two for gifts for baby showers.  My son used this till he was 5 months.  It is all he would sleep in at night since he had reflux problems.  I like that it sets higher up off the floors than bouncy seats and is easy to pull from room to room.  We also took this when we went to visit friends or was gone overnight. Reading on here is the first I have heard of mold problems but I regularly cleaned mine, by removing the cover and washing and wiping the plastic parts down with lysol wipes.  I never saw mold of any kind on mine and I always cleaned and inspected it everywhere.",1
"This cup is sensational, helps the baby learn to take things in the cup without making a mess and safely.",1
"I read as many reviews as I could about this and similar pregnancy pillows. I finally settled on this one because of the price and size (I'm only 5'0""). Unfortunately, it's actually *too* small for me. I use it in most of the ways illustrated on the instruction card it comes with. I just don't use it along my back or stomach when I'm sleep on my side. Also, the pillow is well insulated, which can be bad or good depending on where you live. Here in FL, it can make for an uncomfortably warm night, even with A/C and a ceiling fan. All in all, a serviceable product, but not what I had been hoping for.",0
"These are so soft and the inside looks really comfortable. They only require one wash prior to wearing so the prep is easy. We prepped ours right away and she wore both diapers the same day they were delivered. Our baby is a heavy wetter and these did not leak or have blowouts - and she did poop in both of them. The fit was excellent at both the leg and the waist - snug but not too tight, and she seemed comfortable. I do wish they came in singles or at least a two-pack of different patterns since this is the only duplicate we have.For comparison, our baby weighs about 8 1/2 pounds and is approximately 22 inches long. She still fits the smallest setting but doesn't need the umbilical cord snap down. The GroVia newborn AIO has leaked for us on multiple occasions and so has the Fuzzibunz extra small pocket diaper - both of those are loose at the waist on her.The only other diapers that have worked for us are the Blueberries/Swaddlebees Newborn Simplex AIO and prefolds with a thirsties cover.",1
"Bought this a couple years ago and I like it.  It is a good size so I feel comfortable that my child can use it to reach the toilet better than a smaller stool.  However there are a couple things that I dislike or at least don't love.  One is that it makes it a bit more clunky for me or another adult to use the toilet, not impossible just awkward.  If it was in my primary bathroom, it might be more annoying, but this in in the bathroom that services my son's room and guest rooms.  The other thing that I dislike is that he kicks it around when he is sitting on the potty.  It doesn't weigh much and is easily a target for a bored potty training child to kick.",1
"I bought this pillow for my wife, and needless to say she loves it. She takes it everywhere we go (if we are staying overnight) and it is very comfortable to lay on. The only difficulty she had was getting the pillow cover back on after she washed it. That took some muscle and some patience, two things that a pregnant wife would much rather her husband do than herself.",1
"In theory this is a handy product. Have had to wait till daughter was 8 pounds. She isn't fond of the sling, but Iam hoping she grows unto it.",1
"I originally ordered the monkey and it held up for about 4 months... even through being washed in the washing machine and tumble dried but eventually the silicone ring began to separate from the monkeys mouth making it a choking hazard. In my opinion I expected it to last longer than just over the 4 month mark so I contacted the company and was told that was normal and that these need to be replaced when damaged just like any other silicone product and they offered me a 15% off coupon that was only good on their site... price was still cheaper on Amazon so I reordered thru them. I got the elephant this time and have had it for about a month and a half and the silicone is beginning to tear again the the same place :/ already. This time however I have been surface cleaning it until about a week ago when I tossed it in the washer and then air dried it... (the silicone began to tear before my decision to put it in the washer). My son really only uses this at bed and nap time, he uses his paci to fall asleep then spits it out, during the day we use a pacifier clip if we need it so the elephant really only gets used in bed and is not used in a rough manner at all... I bought it to keep him from chunking his paci out of his crib through the rungs and for that it works GREAT!",0
My 4 months old daughter loves this gym. It is the only thing that entertains her. I am very happy with the purchase.,1
My daughter used these to learn how to drink from a sippy cup.  I tried a two other kinds before landing on this one.  This is the only one she had success with pretty much right from the start!  highly highly recommend!,1
"This are kind of silky sheets.  The pillow case has princess on them, but the regular sheets have flowers on them.  The picture shows princesses on the sheets, but I only had princess on just the pillow case.  My daughter likes the feel of them though.  They are very good quality.",0
"I love this toy, it even has a little squeaker inside. My daughter loves it too. She looks so cute chewing on the body parts. My husband does not like the toy very much. He thinks it looks like an expensive dog toy.",1
"Wish it didn't come in 2 languages as I had to tape up the spanish portion as I find it too confusing to have 2 languages.  Other than that, it was of good quality, although as mentioned by some of the reviewers, the words were alittle difficult.",0
I've been using smart snugs diapers for over a year now and they have held up really well for me and have saved us so much money!  I would definitely recommend this product.  I use rockin green on them for pre-soaking/washing.  Then place them in our wet pail until wash time and hang them to dry!  They come out perfect every time!  I have never had the diaper itself leak on me and have had far less 'exploders' with these than any other diapers.  As my baby I grew I did start using two reusable inserts in the pocket to soak up more liquid and prevent any leaks especially through the night.  I hope this helps!,1
Fabulous product! It's very absorbant and gives us peace of mind knowing the mattress is protected. Furthermore this product is very comfortable to sleep on.,1
My 7 month old loves this toy.  The best thing about it is that its big enough that it can't easily be tossed to the side and out of reach.  I can put it in front of her and it takes awhile for her to play with it for it to move out of arms length.  Its easy to take along when we go places too.,1
My daughter loves this pillow case because it has her favorite princesses on it. I think the quality of the fabric is a little low but she loves it so that's all that matters.,1
We could not figure this one out so it was sent back to Amazon.  Some of the pieces just did not seem to fit together and the instructions were not very helpful.,0
This product is too small to use in a mobile as is stated could be one purpose. It would have to be very very close to the newborn/infant/childs face to be seen otherwise I cannot see how they could be amused without straining themselves. FYI I measure them and they are not 2 inches at all.,0
"This looks like an okay teether, but I didn't try it out since I saw it was smaller than what I wanted.  I thought this would be larger so that it could go around the babies wrist and be easier for the baby to hold and play with so that I was willing to pay the high cost instead of getting cheaper ones at local stores.  The item descript. has 5.2 x 3.2 x 0.5 but this is 3.2 x 3.2 x 0.5.",0
All the items are top quality are holding up nicely. I love the sheet and the quality. The blanket is so awesome and soft.,1
"I run a home childcare so our highchairs are heavily used and heavily soiled.  I bought two of these last year and I just love love love them!  Not only from the ease and simplicity of getting the kiddos in and out (and the seat reclines, too), but EVERYTHING just wipes off the fabric.  They still look brand new!  Even if I forget to clean on Friday afternoon and don't realize it until Monday- all it takes is a hot washcloth and everything wipes right off.  Not a single stain on these and it's been over a year!  HIGHLY recommend this seat for any messy eaters.",1
"Very satisfied with green meadows bouncer. Was well represented and shipped in due time. Wish that music that plays on one of the hanging toys wasn't so loud, can't be that great for baby's ears. But all in all I think I can just let the battery run out and leave it like that.",1
Works great for at home or on the go. Needs to air dry after removing from dryer for a bit because the wet bags stay a little wet unless air dried.,1
"It's a very cute cup.  When we first got it, with the plug it was impossible to even get water out of it!  She had a very had time drinking out of it.  Without the plug, it was too fast and poured out everywhere!  We finally just enlarged the slit in the plug and it comes out perfectly  now!",1
"I ordered this for my 10 month old twins.  When I opened the package, the paperwork stated &#34;WARNING:  choking hazard - small parts.  Not for children under 3 years.&#34;  It was sold as a teething toy!  No where in the item description is it stated that this item is not for children under 3 years.  I wanted to return it, but when I tried, it said this item is not eligible for return.  I am very disappointed.",0
"I really liked this product so much because it served its purpose well, crumb, water and vomit catcher. But the sad thing is, everytime my baby uses this, it leaves a red mark on his neck like somebody tried to strangle him. Though it is not choking him at all. My husband asked me many times about the marks as well, it's pretty bad. Though the mark disappears by the end of the day, its still not acceptable. When I tried to loosen it to where the neck band won't touch his neck or skin, the bib is not going to be sitting right under his chin anymore, thus losing the purpose of using it as a crumb catcher. I think if there was a softer, more gentler neck strap, this would be perfect.",0
"I bought soooo many bottles (at least 10 different brands) before trying this one.  My son did not want to stop breast feeding, he refused every single bottle.  I wanted to bottle feed him because he had 8 teeth by 6 months and would sometimes grind them when eating, ouch.  This was the only bottle he would take.  I guess this was the only nipple shape that felt similar enough for him.  At least give them a try if you are having trouble.  They are glass bottles so I can put them in the dishwasher from time to time.  I don't like putting plastic in the dishwasher.",1
I started using these wipes as soon as lo came home from hospital. I received 2 sets of these as a gift & purchased 3 sets of charlie banana. I quickly was only using the osocozy & using cb as a pee guard. These are excellent for new born poo & superior to any disposible wipe. They are thin enough that I have control of mess & clean much better than cb or disposible.lost a star for unraveling on my newest set,1
"Coupon was not included as described. 2 sizes under getting an xl according to the chart so got the smaller size and its too small. Seems like a quality product, too bad I can't use it",0
"I received this as a gift and wish I had returned it for store credit, but I hate Babies R Us so much I just decided to deal with it. The blade is upside down, for one thing. The cup has to be at least more than half way full to actually puree the food. Any less than half and the blade just spins all the food to the outside. You can't just push down on the cup once and expect that to be enough. You have to constantly hit the cup so the food moves down  and doesn't get stuck at the top (much like a glass ketchup bottle). I am making do with it but I am not even close to being satisfied.",0
"Wonderful stroller! A bit expensive, but definitely well constructed and great for running with!",1
"The top makes it easy to fill but pops right off. Unfortunately I discovered this with a berry/beet blend. Returning for refund, will try a different brand. Perhaps, if it were screw on rather than pop on....",0
"this was a great price for what i got, if you go into other stores you will see robs similar to this and it will be close to 30.00$. my sister in law loves this for her little boy!",1
"really loved the product, was just perfect on my daughter, looked good and helped in organizing the babies stuffnice qualitywill always recommend buying from this store",1
"Love these decals!! These are heavy duty-type decals and they look really nice on the wall. The whole set is very large, so make sure you have enough wall space. I got the teal colored set for my baby boy's room, and it's nicely colored, however, a little feminine looking-but that's probably my fault for choosing teal. I omitted putting the flowers and butterflies on the wall that came with the mini teal-colored animal set that I purchased too, that was definitely too girly. I didn't have many problems applying the decals, but I can now recommend to overlap the decals a little when attaching the branches to the trunk. I tried to fit mine on without overlapping, just perfectly next to each other, and the next day there were small spaces of wall I could see in between, and I had to remove the trunk part and redo. But everything re-stuck, and it looks great!!",1
"Love these - beautiful, stylish and very useful. Perfect for summer babies who need to be covered but not 'cooked' in traditional baby blankets or receivers.",1
"This was a last-minute add-on purchase.  Frankly, I bought it because it was cheap.  My 7-month-old grandson adores it!  I wanted a fill and spill toy that didn't require shape sorting because of his age.  It is quite wonderful.  The barrel contains plush stuffed monkeys, little plastic barrels, and plastic bunches of bananas.  For some reason, Alex likes the bananas best.  They are shaped perfectly for him to be able to pick up easily and chew on--which he never tires of.  The concepts of ""in"" and ""out"" are easily taught with fill and spill toys, and makes for great interactive play with an adult.  An unexpected plus in the lid, which features a fold, down handle. Alex loves playing with it, too!  I spoil this little guy rotten, and it's amazing to see how much he enjoys this simple, basic toy.  Highly recommend.",1
I bought this for my 9 month old granddaughter and she loves it. The swinging door for the horse is her favorite thing. I just wish it had a volume control.,1
"I really wanted to love these diapers. They're very cute and fit well. However, after 2 weeks of use, I can't say that I'm particularly impressed by them. My two largest issues with these diapers are that they are not very absorbent and they are difficult to get fully clean. We have been using these on an average size full-term breastfed newborn and to keep them from leaking, we have to change them quite frequently (at best, with every feeding).Also, as mentioned in other reviews, these take quite a while to get fully dry -- we do one dryer cycle and then lay flat to air dry over night.Overall, I would not purchase these again for an average sized full term baby because of the absorbency issues. However, for a preemie or smaller full term infant, I would say that these could be a nice way to start cloth diapering from the get go.",0
"Our under-the-sink kitchen cabinet has doors that pop open by pushing on them.  Once our young daughter figured this out, she wanted to open them all the time.  Unfortunately, this is also where all of our cleaning products are kept.  Since there are no handles on the doors, we needed a solution that mounted on the doors themselves.This lock solved the problem perfectly.  Each side gets screwed into the back of each cabinet door, and can then be adjusted with the small allen wrench that's included in the package.  Once the lock is in place, it's almost impossible to be opened by little hands, but simple to open for adults.  The only permanent mark will be 2 tiny screw holes on the back of each door.Pros:- Easy to install, with only a screwdriver needed- Mounts to the door, not to handles- Easy for adults to open and close- Leaves no mark on the outside of the cabinet- Indicator shows that lock is secureCons:- It sticks out from the cabinet about 1 inchOverall, it's a great solution for childproofing, especially if your cabinet doesn't have handles.",1
"This carseat has worked well for my daughter. My husband was able to install it fairly easily in our car and I love the cup holders. I also enjoy all the head rests and cushions that came with, those would be better for smaller babies. Our daughter likes riding in it, she has plenty of room. The belts take a little bit of getting used to but now it takes 5 seconds to get her buckled in. I would recommend this model!",1
Great sheet- fits well. I have no complaints. Matches bedroom set. It's nice to always have more than one just in case.,1
Good product but won't stay stuck on my fireplace. I have a brick fireplace and cleaned it as the directions stated.,0
"I was excited to get this toy because I thought it would be a great distractions for my baby when we went out to eat.When we got it he was scared of it and would cry if we spinned the wheel (although this might be a singular occurrence because he gets scared easily lol) He did eventually get over it as we slowly introduced it to him.It's a great toy, I like the concept and the colors only thing that the SUCTION DID NOT WORK!!!!  Most others say it does have a great suction but no matter what I did after a minute it would unsuction and my baby would throw or drop it or pull on it and unsuction it.  Without the suction it's basically useless and is a glorified rattle :( Hopefully if you purchase this the suction will work!",0
"I ordered this monitor to use at my in-laws' home.  (We live in an apartment and have no need for a monitor on a regular basis.)  When we tested it out briefly, it seemed to work fine and so we disposed of the packaging.  This was a poor choice.Upon using the monitor for more than 5 minutes, it became clear that it just flat out doesn't work.  The sound quality is fine when it is on.  However, it just shuts off randomly.  Even when it is in the charging deck, it will turn off.  Obviously, this is not helpful.  Unless you check constantly, you aren't sure whether the baby is still sleeping quietly or whether the monitor has shut itself off.Unfortunately, because we threw out the box, we are out $40+ dollars on this fine product.  My mom bought a First Years monitor with two receivers at Target for less money and it works infinitely better.  Save yourself some hassle and go with a different monitor....----UPDATE:  I spoke with Amazon customer service and they agreed to make a one-time exception and let me return this product without packaging!  So, yay for Amazon!  However, I still would not buy another Angelcare product.",0
"gentle incline wedge, this wedge is not as steep of an incline as other wedges available.  Cover is removable so you can wash & put back on.",1
"The chair and replacement pads are expensive, but I do love them. And after having the chair for 2 years, it was a relief to replace the pads. I washed them so often, that eventually the soft underside began to mold. But, the chair is excellent!! Very good looking and functional.",1
"I really wanted to like these bibs because the designs are so cute but they were damaged the first time I washed them. The instructions on the website are to machine wash and dry, but when I ran them through the dryer the waterproof coating became cloudy and cracked. We later bought the superbibs and love them.",0
"First, let me say that my biggest complaint about this product probably could have been avoided with more research. We added this camera to the monitor system so that we can monitor two children. However, the system does not have a scan function (or any means of monitoring the two cameras simultaneously). As a result, it doesn't meet my needs.Otherwise, the camera seems to be of good quality and is very easy to set-up and adjust.  The picture clarity (even in a completely dark room) from the camera is pretty good especially for the size of the screen. The audio is also very clear.So- overall, the camera serves its function, the monitor does not.The camera feature has provided us with more ""entertainment value"" than I expected - our toddler is a acrobat in bed!",1
"Pros - my gal can hold these because they're narrow.  The nipples were a good transition from low-flow for her.  They're very soft which is good when she's teething.  If you use the pre-mixed Similac bottles, these nipples fit on them.Cons - the nipples are very soft, and can get sucked closed when she's eating voraciously.As with other bottles, I don't use the lids and the nipple covers, so it's wasting my $ to have to pay for them.",1
You really can not appreciate this device until you've used it.No smell unless you don't empty it for a week or more. An airtight vault it's not....but it does what it's designed to do very well.Who doesn't take out the trash more than once a week ? Same concept with this diaper pail.- From a Dad of a Newborn who's thankful he ignored the negative reviews.,1
Bought this item for photo shoots and it couldn't be more perfect. Super cute and classy. Fits perfect for the little ones and seems to be holding strong. Definitely a must buy if looking!,1
"Great seat. Easy to set up. Seems very comfortable for my son who doesn't seem to complain. It is a dark, soft cloth which I like. It doesn't get dirty and if it does it doesn't show. It is easy to take the upholstery out and wash. It comes with a detachable cup holder that my son loves. It is very easy to set up in case you need to switch it from car to car. It fits perfect in our Honda Fit. That car is very small and I had no problem using it rear facing. It is now forward facing and there is much more space in my car. The seat is pretty lightweight as well so it is easy to transport from car to car if you had to. The side protection is great too. It is very plush and soft and doesn't bother my son when he falls asleep and leans against it. Overall a great seat that has all the elements necessary without all the unnecessary bells and whistles.",1
"I liked this toy, it's loud enough, and don't hurt fingers as I thought, and outer loyer is soft. But isn't interesting for my son so far (7 months).",1
"Bought two of these car seats for our twin girls. We have them rear-facing at 13-months old/ 21 lbs. Great pattern and soft material. The girls are comfortable in them and the straps don't seem to bother them at all. It's easy to get the seat out of the car; not as quick/easy to lock it back into the car (this may not be an issue if you only have one child/ one car seat and don't have to pull out the seat very often; plus this is probably an issue with any car seat because they are much bigger/bulkier than the snap & go's). Agree with other comments about visibility. They have to strain their little heads forward to see out the window or to see eachother. All in all, great seats. I would buy them again.",1
"These arent that great. I would stick to the individual storage containers. If you have a little too much in any of the trays it doesn't close properly. Ive also noticed that this gets freezer burn easily. If you are going to be using this for one specific food, its ok.",0
Great stroller. My friend and I each purchased this stroller for our family trip to Disney. The stroller worked well for my 2 year old. The bottom compartment was great for souvenirs and the smaller top compartment was great for holding drinks and storing cell phones. Would highly recommend this stroller!,1
"I expect better from Britax. In terms of construction, comfort and features, I'd give the Frontier 5 stars. But I want to echo what other reviewers have said about nightmare installation with this seat! I took it to my local police station to get help from a certified safety seat technician, and it took him nearly half an hour to get to the point where we were both satisfied that the seat was properly installed. At least I was able to finally get peace of mind, but many communities don't have this kind of resource, and so many parents may not even know that such a thing is available. What are they supposed to do?My vehicle is older (a 2000), so it does not have the LATCH system - maybe that's why the Frontier was so difficult to install. An explanation, perhaps, but not a good excuse! Britax, you owe parents and their children more. Of course, the safest ""seat"" in the world only protects your child if it is installed correctly.I have not removed the seat from my car since it was installed 8 months ago because 1) I'm afraid I won't be able to reinstall it correctly, and 2) I don't want to go through the incredible hassle. If you need to take a safety seat in and out of your vehicle on a regular basis, I definitely recommend you look at another product!",0
"It worked great for several weeks and the kids were using it enthusiastically. Then it just quit turning. They loved it, they set it at 1 minute for hand washing & 2 minutes for teeth brushing. And now that they are used to using it, it died. Now I am shopping for another one.... Suggestions?",0
"These helped me so much! I wasn't able to breastfeed, so pumping was my only option. Pumping every 4 hours is tough, but these certainly made things so much easier! I highly recommend these to all new mommies! *Tip: Lean a tad bit forward when your finished. Every little last drop is so precious to us tired pumping mommies!*",1
I actually bought this to keep my critters out of the toilet and it works great. You need to put it on the front of the lid if you have a soft seat like mine.,1
"This is an adorable mat for your child to play on, but I think it may be TOO stimulating for babies...lots of colors and things hanging down.  By the time they're old enough to truly enjoy it, they're too big to lay there...they'll be rolling around.  It was very easy to set up though.",0
"When our son started trying solids, we bought a few different kinds of spoons to see what worked best. These are superior by far! They don't make as much of a mess and you can scrape the excess off of their mouths easily. Plus, they come in cute colors!",1
"The buggy bag is wonderful! The bag is easy to use with one hand, makes a great changing mat for the car, and holds shopping necessities (wipes, crackers, little juice bottles, and toys)in the pockets. The pillow is a great addition for when the little one falls asleep while shopping; she can just lean forward and take a comfortable snooze. The bag can also be used as a high chair cover. At first, I didn't know if the purchase price was worth it, since I wasn't sure how often it would be used, but I'm happy to report that it was indeed worth it. I use it often, my little girl is not just protected, but she is comfortable as well (it's nicely padded), and I have all the little necessities I need without always packing a diaper bag with me. It's my emergency stash ever present in the car. Moreover, the good looks of the bag get much attention! One thing to keep in mind: it can fade when washed, so watch for that.",1
"If you don't know what you're having, I highly recommend this collection.  We're not finding out what were having this time around (we have 2 boys) and found this collection at Babies R Us when I was picking up some other items (didn't even know Babies R Us had bedding of this caliber).  The soft yellows and greens are perfect.  I'm a little concerned about the blue (in case we have a girl) but love this set so much that we're going to get it anyways.  If we do have a girl, I'll just put in some pink stuffed animals and other accessories.",1
This is a great little toy.  My son is 4 months and he likes holding onto this little ball and trying to figure out how to get it in his mouth!  I know he will continue to be enthralled with it as his motor skills improve and he begins problem-solving development.  Great buy!,1
"Do not be dissuaded or confused by what may be the most inappropriate name ever put on a product. It is not a ""Baby Hamper"" in size, but is a standard full size hamper.The quality was excellent, it was well packaged to protect the hamper during shipment,it is unbelievably inexpensive (I was worried that the cost was a misprint and was tempted to buy two just in case!), and the color was exactly as shown.  This is exactly what I was looking for and am very happy with the purchase.",1
My daughter LOVES this ball.  She loves shaking it and making it chime and also will sit and investigate the different tags for quite a while.,1
I purchased the K&#8217;tan Carrier for my niece.  She used it for about a month when a hole in the seam started to form around the baby&#8217;s head.  I called amazon to find out what my options were. Sine it was past the timeline to return it to the retailer they suggested I call the manufacture. So that is what I did. I called Baby K&#8217;tan and explained what had happened. I had my niece send me some photo&#8217;s of the area with the holes then forward it to the company with a brief write up. I did all of this that day and within an hour the company called me back.  K&#8217;tan sent my niece a brand new carrier with a paid postage to return the defected carrier. Baby K&#8217;tan stands by their product and I Will do business with them again.  My niece loves her carrier and uses it all the time.,1
"I love this item - so soft, cuddle and washes well.  I bought 3 - one for my house, one for my grandson's house & one for the car!",1
Great addition for my stroller. My 3 yr old loves it. Fits perfectly. His comfy when he rides. Great on long day trips like to amusement parks.,1
"You are going to laugh when you'll see it. The colors are a little bit darker than this, but since the paints and materials are approved by the regulations, it is safe and we all know that safe paints are never vibrant..",1
"These are the greatest thing ever. Much better than the tape I had holding my drawers shut. Only thing I dont like is that they only come in white. It is a little eye sore, but not as annoying as my son constanly opening the drawer and smashing my remote and playstation controller on the floor.",1
"my son is 7 months old, fits perfect, reclines all the way back which was very important for me.it's a beautiful shade of red, comfy, stylish, easy to carry when closed, perfect for traveling.",1
"Easy to install (in minutes) without hardware - no screws required, but they are provided for additional stability.  Easy 1 hand opening, once you get used to the safety latch.",1
"I'm a first time mom, so take this with a grain of salt.  However, I'm also college educated (2 bachelors degrees and a masters), so I'd think some things would just be common sense for a baby product.  Here is my take on this monitor:1) If you accidentally forget to turn the camera on and turn the handheld monitor on first, the handheld issues an EXTREMELY LOUD series of beeps to alert that the camera is out of range.  Great if the camera is out of range, awful if you're standing right next to your sleeping infant because you wanted to check and make sure the camera angle was set properly.  Ooooops.2) The screen on the hand-held NEVER turns off.  EVER.  EVER, EVER, EVER.  Unless it runs out of batteries.  (I'll get to that in #3)  So now imagine you've gotten your sleeping bundle of joy to sleep and (gasp!) you want to sleep.  Nope.  The handheld will glow like the surface of the sun unless you cover it with something.  Then you cover it with something and muffle the sounds of your super impatient, hungry baby.  Oh, yes, the same baby that you couldn't see move because you had to cover the screen.  Oooops.3)  Let's say that you've overcome obstacles 1 and 2.  Now you're asleep, the tiny screaming bundle of joy is asleep, and the monitor is appropriately dimmed with an ironic eye mask that you should just put on your face.  Oh no!  You forgot to plug the handheld in to the wall.  Guess how long the battery lasts?  Answer: less time than your infant will sleep.  Because that's how Murphy's law works.  It WILL start beeping.  Loudly.  Everyone in the house will wake up.  You will throw the damned thing in the toilet and go online and write a review of this god-awful piece of crap that ruined your night.So, buy at your own risk!  Good luck!",0
"I'm giving it a 2 star only because as for the smell, it seems to do a good job of keeping it contained in the pail until you open the lid or door. That's my only real pro though and I probably would not buy it again just for that!Cons:- the lid is horribly hard to open! Especially wit a diaper in your hand and trying to either keep your other hand on the baby or hold the baby!- the lid is even harder to close unless the bag is pretty well empty!- the door is way easy to open, which I see as being a huge issue once my baby is mobile!- I HATE having to push the diaper or a wipe through the hole into the bag! I appreciate the attempt to keep the smell at bay, but have to stick my hand into said hole is just gross! And then I have to either already have my child in a safe place prior to throwing the diaper away so I can go wash my hands, or touch my child with dirty hands. Either way, annoying!Good attempts, but just not a practical pail. And can in no way be used for cloth diapers!",0
"I like these bottles and so does my breastfed baby.  The only problem I have with them is the lids!  Half the time I try to take the lid off the bottle before a feeding, it goes flying across the room.  They're slippery and difficult to get a good grip on.  There must be an easier way to get the lid off without having this happen.  It's very frustrating.  Otherwise, a great bottle.",1
"Baby LOVES this mat. She nuzzles it and loves to lay on it.It is super soft and plush, not to mention absolutely ADORABLE!",1
"I purchased 2 of these bibs and really wanted to like them, but ending up returning them and keeping the Bibbity bibs instead.  The pocket on this bib is fantastic, and catches most of the dropped food.  However, I ended up returning these bibs because as other reviewers stated, the neck is too rough.  The material is a very hard plastic, which is fine for the bib, but not for the enclosure around the neck.  My son didn't seem to mind this bib around his neck, but I chose the softer material of the Bibbity bib instead.  This bib did stay in place around my son's neck, but when he pulled on the bib, I thought he was going to get a mark on his neck from the hard plastic.  This is an ok bib that could be great if the neck enclosure was changed.",0
"Soft, bright blue. It fits perfectly and I don't have to fight with it to get it over the corners of the mattress.  It is soft and my son loves how soft it is.  I ordered 2!",1
"This gate works okay.  I find that after I close the latch I often have to tighten one of the sides even further to prevent slipping.  I cannot open the gate without loosening it and if I don't tighten it, it just isn't secure.  That said, it is a simple rotating plastic ring on a threaded rod so adjusting it is pretty easy.My two year old was having a fit and successfully scaled the gate in her bare feet using her toes to help grab the vertical bars.  The gate is high and I was impressed she could defeat it.  That said, she has to be motivated and it keeps her twin sister in check without issue.",0
Bought for my newborn as a first blanket. Have had it over a year washed it and so on still in good condition. Happy with this buy.,1
"First off I want to start by saying this item works. Now that that's said, you are Basicly sucking snot from your kids nose. The only thing between you and snot is a piece of tissue. Very simple to use and effective. Your just sucking snot. If you can get over this, your home free.",0
"We used these for Teddy so my son and Teddy would both be wearing ""big boy underpants"". For my son, I used the absorbent and waterproof PUV type with regular absorbent underpants underneath. That combination was good for about one pee, but they did leak so an immediate change was necessary.At any rate, the plastic underpants were great for Teddy! I wouldn't use them alone over regular ""absorbent"" training pants though, because a second layer of aborbency is needed. They might work well over cloth diapers, though.",1
This is the best metal sippy cup yet. What makes it nice is the rubber that covers the outside so liquids don't make it too hot or too cold to hold.This is for kids that can drink/suck through a straw. It comes with a straw and its short straw which doesn't pour so its not a cup for younger ages.I plan to buy a couple more.,1
"I loved using this warmer while it lasted.  It held tons of cloth wipes, and the simple recipe for wipe solution was great. But after using it for only 3 months it stopped working :(",0
"Exactly what I wanted!  It is perfect and went to my new Great Granddaughter,  Jolea Sara Locke, born 3/14/2014!  It is sturdy and nice looking.  Martha J Reed",1
I would give less than one star if that was possible. These cups are terrible. I knew they had to be too good to be true. They leak no matter how many times you try to make sure the top is on correctly and tightly. I am so disappointed that I fell for such a gimmick! SC Johnson has disappointed me greatly. I agree with the other reviewers in asking .... did you not test your product? I am going to tell everyone about these horrendous cups and make sure they don't steal other people's money! RIDICULOUS!,0
"We got these cups to help my daughter learn to start drinking from a straw. They are leak proof but only when the top is threaded perfectly, which is not easy to do. The seal at the top also has to be positioned perfectly or the cup will leak. This may seem minor but they have to be disassembled and reassembled each time they are washed. Overall, they are decent and we still use them but I will be looking around for different cups when these get worm out or lost.",0
"These pads feel fairly dry against the skin, but I've found that because of that, I leak through the pads and onto my clothes before I even realize that they are wet.  Not bad for overnight use, but because of they are bulky and very obvious under clothing, I only use them at night and would not wear them anywhere in public for fear of leaking.",0
My husband and i saw this piece and i said this is the one.  The price was awesome!  It arrived in about 5 days.  WOW! I like that it has matching pieces to purchase also.  We not only purchased this swing but we also purchased the car seat and the high chair.  Other members of the family purchased the stroller and pack n play.  I would highly recommend this piece.,1
"I have tried EVERY disposable nursing pad out there, and these work just as good if not better. Here and there a little will soak thru to the other side, and only when I go over 4+ hrs. between feeding/pumping at night. Even then it wasnt that bad, and I had the same experience w/ the disposables leaking.They are somewhat discreet, however if you are wearing a thin bra and thin shirt you can kind of see the outline of them - but this is true with any disposables.Yes they sometimes stick to you and this could be a little uncomfortable if you are just beginning to nurse and things are sensitive, but give yourself at least a month for things to ""toughen up"" and then try these out! Now when they do stick, it doesn't hurt and I have had no issues w/ fuzz being left behind.Pros: SoftWash wellSuper cheapEco friendlyCons: The only con is perhaps they could have a super thin waterproof layer in  there to prevent any leaks",1
"This is a great product.  We have a decent video monitor that is nearly 3 years old but we tend to use this more than that because it has a greater range, is easier to travel with and has to parent units which we have found to be surprisingly handy.  I saw it on Bones the other day, which made me scretly smile.  I recommend for every parent!",1
I bought the mattress that fits with this and both products work very well together. My baby loves this cover!,1
"My baby has become a chewing machine and this has worked great on his crib.  Easy to install, soft, looks great in his room and keeps him from chewing on his crib.  Would definitely recommend!",1
"I love these swaddle blankets for our daughter, but the Large is barely big enough for our 3 month/14 lbs. baby, and it's supposed to be for a 14-19 pounder. That said, we will continue using this until she no longer fits it",1
"This bottle is the best thing that ever happened to us. For those middle of the night feedings when your so tired that getting up and making a bottle seems like the largest task, Mixie is right there ready to go push button shake and feed. No more making your hungry little baby wait for food. It's diaper feed go back to sleep. So convenient. I just bought a second one that was when one is washing you can have the other ready to go. I'd own 5 if I could afford it but good to accumulate one by one to add to you collection. Also perfect for the diaper bag on the go. No more being In a store or at an outing and try to scoop and pour formula. So easy love it would recommend to any and everyone. Love love love. A little pricey is the only con.",1
My Mom bought be this stroller and I was super excited. I wanted a stroller where when my son got older he could still face me while we took walks but when he wanted to see the world i could turn him around without an issue. Within the first maybe 2 weeks the rubber on the handle bars started coming off. Its completely gone now. 4 weeks ago the rubber to click the car seat in is completely breaking off. I have to carry WD-40 with me everywhere i go because the wheels are so stiff its not even funny. I have to grease the wheels all the time to get a smooth ride. And on top of that my son doesn't even fit in the seat because the shoulder straps are not positioned right and i can't re position them. i have to fold blankets and make a sort of booster seat for him to sit in the stroller. Wish i could return this 1. ugh my 1st bad review :(,0
"I think the description is very accurate, It's great, looks like high quality, and durable. i love that it teaches you on one side the name of the animal with a picture and on the other side how to spell it in korean.",1
"We have a Graco Pack and Play. This sheets fits well, and is very cushy and soft. We have washed it many times, and it has held up well.",1
"The girl monkey harness is cute and comfortable for my daughter. I wish the pocket was bigger, but that is not the harnesses main function so it doesn't affect the item rating. I think the main benefit is that the harness makes me feel comfortable letting my daughter walk around at the mall or other areas that I probably wouldn't otherwise.",1
We just had our second child and we wanted a monitor that had good video quality that didn't cost too much. We got this monitor with an additional camera for under $170 with shipping and it's a great deal. It switches between the cameras without any lag or delay and the range is very far. Our older boy has a lot of plush toys in his crib and the night vision has no problem in seeing everything clearly although it goes into a black and white mode. The monitor does not warn you before it goes out of battery but this isn't a problem because we have the power cord plugged in unless we are moving it from room to room. Overall this is a great monitor at a great price.,1
I really enjoy the fact that you can sit in a normal position with this pump and not have to hunch over  like some other brands force you too,1
I had first used the milk screen test 6 hours after having a beer.  I was expecting that it would come up negative but wanted to be sure before I pumped.  My husband said we should do a test to make sure the product works.  To drink and then test.  So next time we planned to go out I drank two glasses of wine of about 13% alcohol content.  As soon as I came home from the restaurant about half hour later I hand expressed milk into a cup and then poured it on the test strip.  It was negative.  I was shocked.  I expressed more and got another strip and tried again.  Still negative.  I wouldn't want to know how much I'd have to drink to make a positive because two glasses of wine is usually my limit.  Anyways product is a dud as far as I'm concerned.  Maybe you have to get waisted to get a positive.,0
"This stroller was a cinch to assemble. The handle height is perfect. The wheels are exceptionally sturdy. The infant car seat is easy to click into place and lift out. But most importantly, it's a very smooth ride. So yes, it's little on the pricey side, but worth it.",1
"This gate was easy to install, and the latch is easy to use. The piece that is supposed to allow the gate to only swing one way didn't work for us. It seemed that with a little bit of pressure, you could hear the wood cracking, so we just decided not to use it. Maybe we didn't install the piece correctly. I would recommend this gate and buy it again.",1
"I decided to go with this swing after I had read the great reviews it received here on Amazon. My baby absolutely loved this swing since she was a newborn. The swing and the mobile were very stimulating for our baby. It saved us so much time and energy trying to put her to sleep. I loved the fact that we were able to plug this swing into the wall and not worry about the hassle of batteries. The reason I gave this swing fours stars instead of five was because the motor died after two months of use. I called Fisher-Price Customer Service, and they sent out a new motor immediately. They were very friendly about it. Their customer service gets an A+.",1
"My DD and I have been looking for a body pillow that resembles the one she had with her last pregnancy, but haven't been able to find it--until I saw this on Amazon. She says this one is better.  It's comfy, it holds it's shape and it's &#34;amazingly supportive&#34;  My DD loves it and recommends it highly.",1
"The only reason this only gets 4 stars is because the actual string is a little short.  It works, but keeps falling out.  I am hoping it will function better when he is a little older and his sucking ability is better.  Now it seems like the string just is too heavy and pulls the binky out of his mouth.  It is cute though!",1
"We have this and the Fisher price rainforest jumperoo for our 8 month old twins.  while it holds their attention ok and has a lot of gadgets, I don't like them to sit in it for very long.  For some reason they are always leaning forward, as the seat seems wide from front to back. I have noticed that they both prefer the jumperoo and they sit more upright in that.  Now I wish we had two of those.",0
"Good quality, very handy. Great quantity for the price. Fun to add to a diaper cake or baby shower gift .",1
"I bought this pump before my son was born.  After I started using it, one side stopped working.  I contacted the company via email.  Someone from the company emailed me back several times.  She stated that they had no replacement parts.  She asked for pictures of the &#34;defect.&#34;  While I explained that I had no idea where the actual defect was located, I sent pictures from various angles of the non-working bottle.  Ultimately, she gave me no refund, replacement parts, exchange or other solution.  I've never had a company treat me with such poor customer service.  By the time my son was 7 months old, the second side stopped working as well and I found myself scrambling to buy myself a new pump.  This was a total waste of money!  Know that if you buy this product, they will not back it if you have a problem!  I wish I would have spent more money and just bought a Medela!",0
Love this drying rack! Very useful stay right next to my sink and easy accessible for cleaning and making bottles!,1
"My baby loves it.  He can stay in his chair for hours and he enjoys its music and lights.  He doesn't like the vibration, but I don't care about it.  I recomend it and I will keep it for my next baby.",1
"We got this for my daughter at 6 months (the box says it's for 6+) and she loved it.  When I showed it off to my mom she warned that she thought the hands were chocking hazards.  I thought she was crazy since the toy is for infants that are known to suck and chew on everything, but I decided to check with the doctor at my daughter's appointment the next day.  THE DOCTOR SAID THAT BOTH THE HANDS AND THE HAIR ARE CHOKING HAZARDS as they could come lose or be chewed off.  I was disappointed and thought it looked sturdy myself, but I figure better safe than sorry.  So we cut off the hair and the hands and now it's a lot less cute, but still rattles, so at least it's not a total waste.",0
They are cheaper than Medela microwave bags and works for medela pump accessories. Plus they are a bit bigger than Medela bags.,1
i loved this product untill it broke which was only about 5 months.for such a pricey item i would expect it to work longer.,0
"The pump works great, just what I expected.  It doesn't have the initial ""warm up"" like the medela pump, but you can manipulate the settings to do that if you want.Overall it's great.  The only thing I think is weird is the measurements.  They seem to be off just a little bit.",1
Takes a long time to heat the bottle up so start warming 15 mins before a hungry baby starts crying.  I wish it had a timer or a beeper because I accidentally left it on the lighter and burned it up in a week.  Good tool but I found a drive thru cup of hot water a faster and easier method.,0
"I am more than pleased with this booster seat. I desperately tried to find a new booster seat for my daughter, but I was less than thrilled with the quality of other boosters on the market. They were like junky plastic toys. I just wasn't sold on having my daughter only held in by a seatbelt, so I wanted something with a 5-pt harness for more than 40 lbs, and LATCH.  This seat has it all. It's easy for her to get in and out of (the Marathons, not so much,) it has a harness and LATCH, it's hot pink, and it's super sturdy. It's definitely heavy-- probably not the best seat if it will be often switched between cars, but I definitely feel safe with her in this seat.  I'm hoping to buy a second for her for our other car, and I will definitely buy one for our son when the time comes. Hopefully this review helps someone out there!",1
fits about 1 scoop of most protein powders so i use it for easy access during the weekits good and seals nice,1
"If I could change anything about this unit it would be that it included a second parent unit.Having said that, it works great for us.There is ZERO background noise, which is strange and awesome.I love the temperature feature and the talk feature.It was expensive, but at least it's what I wanted and it works as it is suppose to.",1
"I've tried a few carriers, and the reason I like this one is because it doesn't hurt my back as bad to hold the baby in this carrier compared to others.  I love the sun shade you can pull out(it comes in handy when baby falls asleep).  If I had to say something bad, it would be that the heavy material is not very breathable and it is HOT!  Especially since the baby is cuddled up right against you!  It is also pretty easy to get the baby into the carrier!  I highly recommend this even though it is a little bit expensive.",1
"These things are a life saver. If your little kicks like mine, then these will keep the mud and dirt off your seats. Installation is a snap and take seconds. Even if they only last a year or two, I would buy them again just to have the peace of mind that my seats are protected.",1
I bought these for my 14 month old who loves to put things in and take them out and he loves doing just that with these. He carries the little bag all over and puts other toys into it too.,1
She is a chunky 5 month old but will play in this for ages. Worth it all the way! I promise!,1
"I purchased these after my daughter had diaper rash and I read a bunch of reviews suggesting them.  Perhaps I wasn't using them right, but they weren't particularly helpful for me.  They didn't clean well enough that I was comfortable using them alone, and they didn't stay soft after multiple washes.  I ended up just going directly to bath time after a poo and otherwise rinsing her under the sink upon changing.",0
"Our granddaughter is almost a year old and at this time, she can't really put the pieces into the places where they belong, but she enjoys playing with the ball.  I'm sure this will be a toy that she can play with a lot when she gets a little older.  All of our children played with this ball and it was one of their favorite toys.",1
"Product is horrible, don't waste your money. This monitor has no white noise but you cannot hear in your childs room until a loud noise occurs. Some times it still doesn't register when there is noise. At least my child is older, but this wouldn't have lasted if she was younger. I've heard my Daughter yelling and nothing picked up on the monitor. The thing that finally made me go throw this away after 2 months was that it would loose reception 2 to 3 times per night. I would have to turn off the monitor, walk to my daughters room, turn the monitor back on so it would make another connection and then it seemed ok until the next time.",0
"I just bought this for my 11 month old because I liked an earlier model my baby sitter has.  The old model is better.  My 11 month old is already too big to fit in this with the tray in place.  I concede that she has chubby thighs, but I expected the tray to fit at least until she is a toddler.",0
"The suction cups will not stick to ANY surface in my bathroom, making this product worthless.  Not even worth the $4 I paid.  I've tried to at least come up with a different use, but the bag is too small and netting too weak to even be repurposed.",0
"This utensil set is perfect for my little ones hands.  The fork is not too sharp that he'll stab himself, but pokey enough that he can learn to spear his food.  The spoon bowl is a little large for his little mouth, but overall this set is excellent.  The grippies make it easier for him to hang onto the utensils.  AND, bonus, we got blue/green ones despite the ""colors may vary"" aspect :)",1
"The base stopped working.  The main camera socket is loose so it turns off because there's no electric current going to it.The night vision is NOT automatic, so you have to pick it up to change it to night mode and then the camera that you so carefully positioned has to be repositioned again!  So annoying.I bought the Summer video camera that has auto night mode and moves almost 360 and 180 up/down plus zooms in.  That one is sooo worth it.  The Mobi one that just sits there and is static is not worth the money.",0
I love the ease and compact-ability of this mat.  The colors are perfect for boy or girl. It has a lot of colors which is very stimulant for any baby.  I love that this mat will work for more than just one of my babies.  It is stored away nicely right now and in perfect condition to bring back out for the next baby!,1
"After a few days we noticed that picture was getting blurry. Every day it got worse. After about 10 days it got to the point that we could not see anything other than blur, fuzz and vertical scratch like lines ALL over the screen. Bought this monitor due to amazing reviews but I couldnt return it fast enough.",0
"This is one of the most helpful gagets yet!  Fast, quick and easy!",1
This is a perfect for my wife's 58 year old basinette as we get it ready to welcome our first grandchild - a boy!  We were looking for one to fit and one that wasn't too frilly for our boy! (The hood is separate and we don't need it.),1
"I bought this toy for my one-year-old, and it was an instant hit.  She loves watching the balls go around and round.  I love that it takes no batteries and plays no annoying music.  The balls are really cute, and I wish you could order more of them (I've looked online but can't fine any).  A year later, my daughter has figured out how to take the different sections apart and rearrange them.  Its a toy that visiting children always seem to gravitate towards.  It was a good purchase!",1
"Adorable, got this for my new baby niece, her dad is a chef!  Was so cute at the baby shower!!",1
"I love this Pack 'N Play! My son has been sleeping in it since day 1 and 3 months later it is still working great. It's very sturdy and easy to put together. The little doggies are detachable and really soft. My son loves playing with them. The music is quite but in his quiet room, it's just fine and has an assortment of different sounds. The vibration is the best. He uses it every night and while it uses up a lot of batteries, it still works great 3 months later. It is huge which is a little annoying since he's just using it to sleep in but when he starts playing in it, it will be great. The changing table is awesome, it's a little high so now that he's getting heavier, it's a little awkward. But I love that I can open it with one hand and the compartments are the perfect size. The changing pad it's self can be a little cold so I put a receiving blanket on it so the cold doesn't shock him. Expensive but well worth it... And I'm as cheep as they come :)",1
"This stroller is amazingly well built for $50. It is VERY sturdy and easy to use. Took only a few mintues to set up-wheels and canopy. I got the black and red-very stylish looking.The handles are taller than a typical umbrella stroller, pushing it is really easy, no bending over and I dont have to &#34;short step&#34; so I don't kick the back of the stroller. The wheels are larger and wider than normal, makes it easy to push over rougher terrain, works well in grass too.Overall this is a great umbrella type stroller that will probably become our main stroller.",1
I love this so much. My son been using this mat since he was 6 month and now he's 10 month. Great stuff to have for the little ones.,1
"Maximum recommended weight listed as 96 pounds online In the Amazon description. When the jumper arrived, the maximum weight in the instruction manual is only 25 pounds!!!! VERY disappointed. Our bambini would only be able to use for a few weeks, if that long. Waste of time & money. False advertising.",0
"My first set of pacifiers ended up growing something inside of the mouth piece so I bought these as a replacement. The Green Sprouts pacies are made of single piece silicone which is wonderful. Easy to clean. They seemed a bit big to me, but my baby did not seem to mind. Great product!",1
"We started out with 2 options - Graco Turbo and this Compass Folding Booster. In the end, we decided to pay more and go with this Compass for the following reasons:1. Adjustable height for the headrest/shoulder belt - which allows my son to grow with the car seat. Even when he is older, he can still enjoy the head rest with the shoulder belt safely strapped over his chest.2. Foldable seat - When we need extra space in the back row, this seat can be folded and tucked away in the trunk. Also, we intend to travel with our 3 yr old son. I am fearful about the way the Graco Turbo Booster will be treated by the baggage handlers at the airport. At least the folding carseat can fit into an evenly shaped box and be checked in.The minus points of this car seat -a. Its still a bit bulky in appearance compared to the Graco Turbo.b. Even when folded, dont expect this seat to fit into your luggage. It will still need to be checked in as a separate piece of luggage. See the dimensions on the package.c. Limited fabric choices - We got the Navy Blue which we think is pretty nice.The extra plus points -a. the head rest is really cushy. My son loves it.b. the seat is very roomy and plush.",1
"I cannot live without this carrier! Taking a baby stroller everywhere can be such a hassle and this makes things so much easier. Also, for breastfeeding mamas, it's extremely easy to discretely nurse while wearing the baby in this carrier. I've done it everywhere and people are none the wiser. My son usually falls asleep as well, which is a major bonus. I've worn this hiking (6+ miles), shopping, to sporting events, pretty much anywhere I needed to go that would be a hassle for a stroller.The &#34;performance&#34; fabric is nice, but don't expect it to be very cool, after all, you're still carrying a baby, and the baby will be warm. That being said, I've worn this on very hot summer days and it was fine. Just expect to be a little sweaty when you take it off.The sizing of this carrier is fantastic for both men and women. My husband and I both wear it and it's comfortable for both of us. It's easy to adjust as well.It's quite difficult to get the baby on your back by yourself. My husband is able to do it, but my arms just aren't long enough. It's super easy to get the baby into a front carry by yourself.",1
My daughter loved this swing.  She would stay in and swing for hours.  The aquatic mobile kept her interest.  It is easy to clean.  Not easy to move from one spot to another & goes through a lot of batteries.,1
"I'm glad I waited a few months to review this carrier. My first impression was a little low, but it turned out to be me rather than the carrier. It fits my wife and I very well. I went on a 2 hours hike up a mountain with my 30 lbs son and barely noticed he was there. I used to go through the airport which was actually easier than a stroller (it folds up nicely and fits in the overhead bin). I'm very happy with the quality and price compared to other brands. I only have 3 minor complaints. First, the included &#34;cell phone&#34; pouch is not wide enough to fit a today's smartphones. Second, the clips that attach the fanny pack to the carrier are plastic with about a 10 lbs weight limit so you can't put heavier items in the pouch. Finally, this carrier has a max weight of 96 lbs. My son is currently 30 lbs and about 30 inches long and fits nicely. I can't imagine how a 90 lbs kid is going to fit in this even though I'm sure the carrier could hold the weight. Maybe a 60 lbs kid can fit, but I can't imagine any bigger than that.",1
"Had the swing now for 5 months, it worked great in the beginning, not loud like some people said but now it is creeking like crazy and I don't know how to make it stop!  It seems to keep the little one sleeping with the repetitive noise but it is really creeking bad now.  Wish I knew how to fix it, I keep adjusting the legs but nothing seems to work.",0
"These are much better looking than the ugly foam corner cushions that are out there, especially because you don't have to worry about color matching. And it was easy to install.However, my child doesn't walk yet and hasn't fallen into it, so I will hold off on giving it 5 stars.",1
Very soft and durable. Just as advertised,1
"I seriously love this so much, I want to buy a ton more! I love the quality, and it's just perfect in every way.",1
"None of the drain plugs that came with our house when we bought it worked in either bathtub.  I wasn't sure how this Oxo tub drain stopper would work b/c I had tried using a silicone trivet (potholder thing) and it didn't work that well, but this works great.  Seems like you could probably find something cheaper but all in all I am very happy with it.  I'm 9 months pregnant and needed something for the baby so we could give him baths.  I like the suction cup that keeps it in place and stores it when I am not using it.  I've been taking a lot of baths lately to prepare for labor, and I'm just glad something cheap and easy worked out.Update: you can buy much cheaper ones at the grocery store.  It gets kind of mildewy/moldy? on the bottom side.  It sometimes slides around when my son is in the tub, but my toddler has a lot of fun playing with it.",1
Looks beautiful! The theme was perfect for our heaven sent baby girl.Ruffles and lace and a beautiful soft pink.  Everything included to make this ensemble perfect. Looks more expensivethen what I paid for it.  Very Happy,1
"I ordered two of these, one for my potty training 3 year old and another for my soon to be potty training 2 year old.  It has saved me a few times when my son had an accident in the car.  All I had to do was wash this pad rather than taking off the entire seat cover.  While using it on my 2 year olds seat, I've removed it and shaken it out a few times a week to get out all the little crumbs that fall down into the seat, which saves me from having to vacuum it out.",1
I received one Aden and Anais swaddling blankets as part of a baby shower gift and absolutely feel in love with it. I ordered 2 four packs immediately after. The prints are gorgeous and the fabric is so soft and amazing. They wash well and actually get softer with each wash. Perfect for the warmer season as it has breathability. I will only wrap my baby up in these...nothing else!,1
It's good and comfortable and has a lot of padding. The cup holder comes really handy. The recline is not great and sometimes I feel my kid is sitting too straight. But overall I think it is a great product.,1
"I wish I could send this thing back, but I threw the box away and have kept it too long, trying to get it to work out, but now I'm done w/it. I can't get the bottom bar to stay secure. The gate is good in theory, but I have an active and curious baby, and he's always trying to go underneath it because the lower bar won't stay put. I feel like I wasted the $30 I spent on this gate.",0
so cute....it talks...the colors...my baby loves it...i wish the seat wasnt so hard.....they should make soft potty seats for toddlers...i still give it a five because i dont think soft potty seats exist.,1
"I've had this bag for 6 months and it still looks brand new (even though I have spilled formula and water inside).  I love the green lining, the many different pockets, and the changing pad.  The outer design is great!  My only issue is when I store bottles in the side pockets, it decreases space inside the bag.  Wish this bag was a little bigger.  Still love it though :)",1
"We're preparing a nursery for our first child and bought this chair because I thought it was the same one I saw at Babies R Us only this one was much cheaper. I think the chair actually was the same, but the fabric wasn't, which is maybe why it was so much cheaper. The fabric was more on the coarser side and I knew it wouldn't be very comfortable on my elbows. Also, the look of the fabric is sort of dated. We were also worried because the back of the chair comes up pretty high and I'm 5' 5"" and didn't want my neck to get uncomfortable after sitting in it for a while. We ended up getting the Storkcraft hoop glider. I think I will like it better because the fabric is a lot softer and the back is lower so I can rest my head on it. I thought the quality would be a lot different between the two because of the brand and price difference, but they don't seem to be all that different in quality. Overall this isn't a bad chair, just not very soft fabric and a high back.",0
"Our 9 month old daughter is enjoying these, and I think as she gets older she will continue to. We can discuss colors and shapes. I do agree that the water just rushes out of them  - doesn't really make a pattern. I was thinking these would be fun in the sandbox this summer though.",1
"My kids are well out of diapers but we still use these when we travel. They take up little room but are so convenient when you're on the road. We've used them for wet bathing suits, wet clothes, leftover dinners, trashbags, bagged and boxed snacks, etc. The scented bags cover up nasty smells of trash or garlicy dinners! I usually give them as baby shower presents just to enlighten my new moms as to the delight of these trusty bags! Be forewarned though: our puppy LOVES the flowery smell so we have to keep them out of his way as he's been known to chew on them.",1
My grandson loves it!  His little legs get a great workout!  Plus he enjoys the music and toys attached.,1
"I'm blessed with a cosleeping baby that (besides snacking in the night), sleeps a good 12 hours. But... Sleeping a d snacking all night results in a lot of pee. I've tried several different things to keep baby dry at night and the Grovia diaper plus a booster is one thing that works!",1
the tape that is attached to the back didn't work. I got them for public bathroom use. they were difficult to secure as the tape came off as I pulled the strip from them.,0
This is the 3rd &#34;Froggy&#34; I've bought my grandson.  He takes it everywhere.  He has worn one out (the dog ate most of it) and he lost one.  This will be the last one because my little guy is growing up.,1
Purchased as a gift for first grandchild. Her clothes fit perfectly on these hangers and the covering keeps them on the hangers. Arrived quickly!,1
"its comical, whenever anybody sees it they lagh but the pacifier itself is a bit stiff, it was hard for my sister kid to get used to it, he would always spit it out, but whenever his favorite was missing he seemed to like it, but i think he just likes beeing the center of attention, haha, jkjk. the plastic arounf the pacifier, in my case and orange setting, is of good material, not flimsy at all. Overall i think this is a good substitute pacifier.",0
"Great plush, got it for my sister for christmas and she died from its cuteness and softness. Great gift for plush toy collectors.",1
I am cloth diapering and I first purchased osocozy wipes - which are nice but stitching is coming off after several washes and I found I didn't have enough so I bought a package of these to try and oh my! These are a little more expensive but well worth the $$$... they are so soft and not only make a great cloth wipe but function as a nice washcloth too. They seem to be holding up well with washes too.I would highly recommend spending a few more dollars and buying these instead of other wipes!,1
"The positive:Feels sturdy and safe.The negative:Yes, there are three settings for recline, but what they fail to clearly mention is that you have to set the recline BEFORE you install the seat. Once it is in place, you cannot adjust it. So, if your kid takes his nap, don't expect to be able to recline his seat for him. You will actually have to losen all the straps before you can do that. The seat is designed in such way that the straps are attached to the moving part of the chair, instead of to the non-moving base. Also, adjusting the straps is not easy because they do not run smooth, which makes installing a hassle (compared to other car seats we've had).The verdict:I would advise to look for a different seat.",0
I paid 7 or 8 dollars for this teether and I guess I was expecting a little more. My daughter loves it though. I put it in the fridge sometimes to let the plastic get cold to soothe her gums.,1
"This kit includes drivers, webcam software, and pass-through cable to connect the MobiCam monitor to your PC via USB.An additional monthly subscription fee is required if you actually want to view your MobiCam remotely via the Web.  They allow up to 2 hours viewing time per month, but with grandparents that live 7 hours away, 2 hours won't get them through a month. So, if you decide to get this, then pay the $ and allow grandparents to experience the child's life while they still can.I began to worry when I noticed one of the requirements, as listed on their box, is a ""steaming"" internet connection.  This shows a lack of attention to detail and poor quality assurance; I would have immediately put this thing back on the shelf and walked away after reading a typo like that on product packaging.  How good could it really be if this is how they're marketing themselves?  But, this was given to us as a gift; so, I tried it out.  My fears worsened after I began to read the included manual - my 9-week old son could produce a better technical document than what they put out...I was embarrassed for them.I installed the software on my desktop, and was able to get it working after some trials & tribulations with my firewall.  However, the web cam software (mpeg4decoder.exe) crashes consistently, taking Windows Explorer down with it.  I decided to try the software on my laptop to see if it worked any better on a different computer.  Upon installation, Avira AntiVir identified the webcam software as a backdoor server (BDS/Hupigon.Gen).Also, the software can only be installed on one computer.  We would like to use it on our desktop on occasion, so I can use my laptop to access the internet and view my son when I'm away on business.  We would also like to use it on the laptop downstairs, when my wife & I are both at home and viewing the MobiCam monitor downstairs, while baby sleeps upstairs.In summary:  buggy software needs to be fixed; questionable virus/backdoor distributed with their software; software should be allowed on multiple computers (e.g. iTunes); fix horrible writing & typos in your documentation and on your product packaging - show us you care about your product.",0
So glad they came out with this item . . I love using it for my baby since he doesn't always eat the whole bag in one sitting.,1
"This product is awful and potentially dangerous.  We bought one and tried to suction it to the back window of our car.  It fell 15 minutes later (thankfully we had just taken the baby out of the car, or else it would've fallen right on her!)  I thought maybe it was a fluke so I tried again. Again, it failed to suction to the window.  We now have a product that we can't use.  If I could give this product 0 stars, I would.  Fisher Price shouldn't even have this product on the market.",0
I love the design of this album and the ease of use. It does have a strong plastic odor that dissipates it left open overnight. The cover on the back had come unstitched but was easy enough to repair.,1
"Great bumper...super soft...perfect shade of baby blue!  Wanted a plain bumper without any type of &#34;theme&#34;, and this fit the bill exactly.  Would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a simple crib bumper.",1
Great set and a great pricePerfect for my son who loves Mike the Knight Would recommend to a friend,1
This is an adorable toy that is amazingly sturdy! My 1 1/2 year old has really tested the durability while dragging it allover the house... but it still works like the day she got it. Great craftsmanship!,1
This base works great with my carseat--it makes it easy to transport the baby in eaither car without having to move the base! Great for families with more than one car...and grandparents too!,1
"I bought this about 6 months ago. It's my 3rd stroller for my only child. I already have the stroller that came with the carseat and a jogging stroller but they take up too much trunk space in the car sometimes and are a little too big for traveling. This one is great. It's very sturdy (can hold up to a 50 lbs child). The 5-point harness adjust easily. It has a cup holder that works pretty good conisdering it's not made out of plastic but fabric (f you put a very small/short cup in there that's not on tight you risk the lid coming off). I also like the zipper part next to the cupholder which is great for keys and cellphones. I can fold the stroller using one foot only (and un-fold it with one foot) which comes in handy when you're short on hands! The ""gate check"" bag that can be purchased fits it good, has straps for carrying, and we're planning on using it for air travel next month. The only drawbacks are limited storage space underneath the stroller (and it's a little hard to reach it) and the seat doesn't fold down if your child wants to nap (but my daughter doesn't seem to mind). Overall, for an umbrella stroller, it's a great buy!",1
I like it. Only thing I wish was that it covered my sides. It leaves me feeling exposed on the sides. it is really soft and pretty.,0
"This tub was a great purchase!! I wanted a simple tub that I didnt need a users manual to figure out how it works and didn't have mechanical parts that could get waterlogged and broken. This tub does not disappoint! The design is sleek and simple, fitting perfectly into the sink. My baby has always been long so would stick his spindly little legs out of the sling, but it definitely served its purpose until he got to big. Now he lounges in the tub itself and loves his tubby time! You still need to tip it over to get every last bit of water out but that's really no big deal. I also love the convenient place to put shampoo etc! Great little tub!",1
"I received this stroller as a shower gift.  I love the look of it.  The height is perfect as I'm 5'10 and my husband is 6'5... I love the durability, and that the seat reclines easily.  However, it's not so simple to open and close... it took my husband and I 10 minutes to figure out how to collapse.  The basket is so inconvenient.  Our son is 3 months, and we often have to seat reclined.  Forget about putting anything in the basket.  It doesn't hold much, certainly not a diaper bag. This being out first child, I didn't realize how much I would like having cup holders and a snack bar...This stroller pushes well and seems roomy enough for our son, but if we're out shopping or have to take anything with us, this is just not the stroller to take.",0
"This booster car seat was just what we were looking for! It was easy to install (we didn't find it any more difficult than other car seats).  It's easy for our 3 year old to climb into by herself, which has proven to be very convenient & quite a help when we're rushing out the door.  We're still using the harness, which she can buckle the chest clasp by herself but isn't strong enough for the other latch.Especially for the unbeatable price, we are very happy with our purchase!",1
"I have to agree with the other parent, the Dr.Brown 8oz bottles don't fit. I can't return mine because I have had it for 2 months & can't find the box or instructions. Very poor design. I have to boil my 8oz bottles on the stove to sanitize. I may just go buy a differnt sterilizer after reading reviews on other brands. Wish I had read reviews before registering for this.",0
"My son was born with a heart defect and was hospitalized for the first 2 weeks of his life. I was unable to breastfeed him while he was in the hospital but knew that breastmilk would be the best thing for him. While he was in the hospital I used the electric pump that they had at the hospital, but needed something for when we went home. This pump is made by the same company that made the hospital pump and works wonderfully. It is by far the best retail pump I have used and well worth every penny!",1
"I have been using these sheets for my son for the past 19 months.  I am now ordering more for my newborn daughter who just arrived a week and a half ago.  I received regular crib sheets as gifts and some came with the bedding sets for the kids, but I still use these and prefer them over the others.  With cribs being fixed side and convertible now, these sheets are more convenient to use.  The only time I have to remove the bumper pad and mattress is when I need to wash the bottom part of the sheet set.  These are a must have for any parent, and is now my ""go to"" gift for baby showers along with ""The Happiest Baby on the Block"" dvd, but that is another review...",1
Prevents my son from falling but at the same time its easy for him to get out of the crib/bed.,1
This turtle neck bodysuit is super cute! It fits well too! My daughter will be wearing it for Halloween as a part of her cat costume. She also wears it as a base layer. Very pleased! Turtle neck bodysuits are pretty hard to find so I was so happy this one fully met our needs!,1
These are nice soft towels. They are thin but don't feel cheap. The hood is nice but way to big for my little guy.,1
"My baby HATED her infant carrier style seat. It was a super cheap cosco. Do not recommend. I was going to take her on a 17-hour roadtrip, and I figured that the nicest thing I could do for her was upgrade her carseat. She's only 6 months old, but she LOVES this carseat. She was happy like, the entire trip. Also, it's easy to install in multiple cars (I used one regular sized, rolled up towel to recline it correctly). Adjusting the straps is also a breeze with the strap on the front bottom. The only negative comment I have is that the light gray part is made of a strange fabric, that doesn't feel rough until you've been sitting next to baby and resting your arm on it for a couple of hours. Then I looked and saw what looked and felt like rug burn. Minor problem, easily fixed.",1
"product was great at first. i was so excited because it's a really good price and it seemed to have the best reviews for a cheaper breast pump. when i got it, it worked great. i really only used it to pump milk if i had to go out and wouldn't be able to breast feed my son. My son is 8 weeks old now and the one valve on the pump doesn't work at all and the motor is very weak. it won't even pump milk out now. it'll turn on but the strength of the motor is like the weakest of the settings no matter how high i turn it up. not worth the money. i'm sure there's a better pump out there for a little less or a little more money.",0
"I bought this for my son's toddler bed before I read any of the reviews.  I can't say that I like this rail very much, but I gave it two stars because I think it would be terrific when my son moves on to a big boy bed.1.  This rail sits too far in on the bed making the bed very narrow and not allowing any room for my boy to roll around while he is sleeping.2.  When the rail is folded down, it takes up too much room on the floor making it impossible for my son to climb into his bed when he's tired.3.  The rail is about the width of my son's bed so when he wakes up, he's trapped in his bed and then I'm afaid that he'll try to climb over the rail and fall.4.  I broke the darn thing when I was trying to pull up the rail so that I could fold it down and I am by no means a strong woman, fortunatly my husband found a way to fix the blasted thing.But, all in all, I think it will be a good rail when it is used with a full size bed.  My son has a 3 in 1 crib so I might as well adjust the toddler bed into a full size bed so that we get some use out of the rail.",0
My boy is three and he loved this gift before we put it in the bathtub.  He has to have it everytime we put him in the tub.  It is a nice size and floats well in the tub,1
My baby loves it since he was 2 months old. He is now 11 month and he still loves it. It has an excellent soothing and playing music. It comes with 3 different modes with 3 different time settings. I only wish that it comes with a remote but other than that worth buying it.,1
"I loved this sleep sac and my daughter was incredibly warm and comfortable in it. However, within 2 days of receiving it, the top of the zipper broke off. It was still useable though so we powered through. After about 12 uses the zipper itself broke - and after reading the many many reviews that list this as a problem I am surprised the company has not done anything to fix the problem! As it would cost more to have the zipper fixed than to order a new one, I am sadly on the hunt for a new sleep sac to replace this one - probably by a different company.Side note: It's been a warm summer in CA and while we have only used it 12 times, we are outside of the 90 day Amazon return policy.",0
After using for only a month the charging port broke. I've read this problem with other reviews many times. Supposedly this problem was fixed as of products sold after March 1 but my monitor has the same problem and I bought it after March 1.  The monitor is great except now I don't have one after spending so much money.  Not sure I would recommend this product unless you have a back up to use when it breaks in the middle of the night and while you wait for a new one from the company. Disappointed with the product for the price.,0
"We bought several of these sippy cups because of the soft spout, but moreover, because it was one of the few sippy cups (if not the only) we found that still had the ounce measurements labeled on the side. This was important to us because we were transitioning to the sippy cup before our daughter was one year old so we still needed the ounce labels for measuring out her formula. Great cups! My only complaint would be storage as the handles do stick out a bit, but those same handles were also great in the transition from bottle. Oh...and if you screw the lid on too tight the spout will cave in, but we just learned quickly not to do that and it wasn't a problem.",1
"My 12 month old pulled these off the coffee table one by one then proceeded to gnaw on them for the rest of the evening.  We have since removed the coffee table from the premises due to the threat of injury.  Please make a more reliable, childproof product :(",0
I wish they got rid of the velcro and just made it more elastic.  the velcro can end up scratching baby.,1
we also choose wood toys for our littles. this is nicely made but a bit overpriced for what it is compared to similar toys.,0
"Wish we had bought this for our first child! The great thing is that the arms move, and it is easy to clip on your own toys. Our baby loved this even as a newborn (in the reclined position). Now a 7 month old, she loves to make herself bounce.",1
I really like this Breastpump Bra. The adjustable feature is crucial to me as others stretch out too much (I have another brand as well). I recommend this one.,1
"Just finished installing the gate and my initial impressions are very good. It was easy to install and looks good. If you have base board along the floor then you must install above the baseboard, instead of the foor.",1
"We have used this crib for over 6 months now - love the look, and the feel. It's sturdy. I use the drawer at the bottom to store his bedroom toys, so it keeps the room neat and tidy. The other modern designs are much more expensive, so I feel that this is the best deal for someone who doesn't like the more ornate looking cribs.",1
"i had a 3rd degree tear with my first daughter and used a spray that was medicated that the hospital gave me, this time around i wasn't going to a hospital so i knew i would need to by something and turns out i had a 2nd degree tear this time so i did need it....this is what i chose and it helped a great deal....only down fall it that it is hard to get it to spray when you hold it upside down which is the easiest way to spray it where you need to...i didn't even use a half a bottle and used it for 4 weeks :) so i think a smaller size with a differnt pump and it would be perfect",1
"The product description is false, this only expands to 40 inches, not 60. I'm returning it for only this reason.",0
"The product seems solid at this point, I've stepped on it, the boy has stomped all over it and it still works fine.The biggest complaint is the volume.  I have turned this thing all the way up and can kind of see why the boy doesn't really get into that much, the volume is too low to really capture his attention.Yes I KNOW HOW TO TURN THIS UP.  I have tried replacing the batteries on the unit and still it is quiet.So it distracts him for about 2-3mins if that and then he'll get bored.BTW my son is 10months old, just so you can use something as a reference point.The sound quality is all well and good, the amount of variety of songs isn't bad for the money and size of this product.",0
Got this for my great-grandson who likes to be warm - it is beautiful and nicely made.  We love it!,1
We purchased this fork and spoon set as a gift.  It arrived quickly and seemed to be great quality.  I would recommend to any parents who are 'Harley Davidson fans'! It was a very cute gift.,1
"these were decent ring sizer. They are a bit clunky. I was hoping they would be a bit slimmer and longer. The sizers did not stay on my ring very well, I kept having to readjust the sixzer throughout the day.",0
"My wife wanted to give this product zero stars. Unfortunately amazon does not have that option.This product worked great for 40 days and then totally lost it's suction.For a breast pump selling at this price point, I would expect greater reliability.",0
"I think this is a great product.  Soft, but not too soft that she sinks in.  I like the curve it has too.",1
I thought this might stop my daughter from opening up her buckle but my daughter figured out how to open it up soon after I put it on.,0
Got them up and everything is great now. Definitely recommend them to others are looking for something similar. Saved my head also.,1
This is a great space saving and cost saving highchair. It has all the toys that the bigger more expensive highchair has at a 1/3 of the cost! Toys are durable and easy to clean.,1
"These blankets are AMAZING.  They wear very well, my daughter has used the green one every night for over four years.  I bought two others, thinking the green one would wear out, but it hasn't.  These are super soft, wash very well and there is no fraying.  Awesome baby gift.",1
"These are easy to use, easy to clean and very bright and colourful. My granddaughter loves them and her mom is pleased that her floors are now protected, as well as a bit of padding for the baby!",1
"I wish I would have read the other reviews. These were a little hard to get on, so I didn't use them much at all. I did like that they were plain white. I think they could be improved if the bands that go around the wrist were stretchy.",0
"I purchased this motorbike for my grand kid, it's the best, keeps him busy with fun all day and away from the Tv!",1
"We purchased this product for our 1yr old son. This product looks very nice in our living room,and my son loves it too. It has music and lights for him to play. I suggest getting two sets rather than extensions, the two sets make a perfect size for a living room. This product is very sturdy and safe for little ones.",1
"We absolutely love this car seat. It is so easy to get our son into and out of and it is roomy and comfortable for him. I love how easily you can adjust the straps and the ease of cleaning it. It did take a while to install the first time, but now it just takes a minute. It attaches very strongly and doesn't wiggle around at all. It is very large, though, so if your vehicle is too small it may not fit. We have an SUV and my other two children (not in car seats) sit on either side of the seat and they still fit. We had a car seat we didn't like prior to this one, so we appreciate this one even more. It was worth every penny!",1
"This mat is awesome and really does what it claims.  I tighten our car seats down really well and we have no depressions in our leather seats.  It also is great at collecting the kids crumbs and dirt.  You just take out the mat, shake it off, and the seat is protected from all of it.",1
My child loves it and I am happy she is so safe! Very durable and great colors will last a long time!,1
"Updated review: My original review from 1/11 (which was one star) was more of a comment than a review, since I hadn't used the pump at that time. Since that time, I ended up using this pump for 4 1/2 months, and used it a ton, as I ended up exclusively pumping. In light of that, I thought it was only fair to give a proper review.Since I was pumping so much, the lightweight aspect of the pump and the fact it was hands free ended up being very helpful. However, for whatever reason, the suction level as just never seemed sufficient for me).  I almost always ended up on Level 10, and wished I could have gone higher. Medela even sent me a second pump (great customer service, by the way), and it was exactly the same, so I know it was me and not the pump. I did have low-supply issues, so that might have something to do with it--I never really had a great supply--but who really knows? Looking back on the purchase, I wish I had rented a heavy-duty Medela Symphony from the hospital rather than use this pump since the whole breastfeeding/pumping thing ended up being so difficult for me and only lasting 4 1/2 months, so I would advise purchasers to wait until they are going back to work and planning to continue pumping before investing in one of these. However, if you know you are going to be pumping, I actually now think this pump is pretty good. It does spill easily (which is NOT cool if you have supply issues), but you quickly figure out how to move to keep that from happening. My lactation consultant also let me listen to the noise of the Pump-in-Style, and I actually don't think it is any louder than the Freestyle.  I also used it in my office, and, while it certainly was loud, no one near my office said they could hear it. Not sure now why the LC at my breastfeeding was so down on the Freestyle. At the end of the day, I found it to be very reliable and convenient, suction and price issues notwithstanding.****************Just wanted to give information seekers a heads-up on the Freestyle.  Due to it's price, I foolishly assumed this was the best breastpump out there for a working mom.  So, when I found it on sale, I immediately scooped it up.  I haven't had my baby yet (due next month), but opened the pump last week to figure out it.  What I found was not reassuring.  I really wasn't impressed with how weak the suction was.  I even had my mechanical-wizard husband check it out, and he agreed that the level of suction, even on the highest speed, was really not that intense. I was also turned off by the loud noise of the pump, and I know that the person whose office is next to mine is not going to appreciate hearing that very loud noise 3 times a day!But, my greatest concern (and the reason for the one-star), is that I just came back from my hospital's breastfeeding class, and the lactation consulting specifically advised everyone in the class AGAINST the Freestyle.  She said the hospital ONLY recommended the Pump in Style for working mothers and wasn't even going to sell the freestyle anymore b/c it had such workmanship problems, leaked, had very poor suction and was inexplicably $100 more.  Needless to say, I was sickened to hear this news and realize that I had dropped all this money on a subpar pump, but it did confirm some initial concerns I had about it.  Just to verify the information the hospital was giving me, I tested the Pump in Style the hospital made available at the class and found that it was both quieter and had better suction.Apparently, since I already opened my Freestyle (even though I haven't used it), there is no way I can return exchange it now.  So, I write this review as a cautionary tale to all of you looking for and researching breast pumps: stay away from this one!  I am actually pretty irritiated that Medela would market such an expensive but poorly-performing pump to working mothers (it frankly seems unethical), so, if any of you are  have breast pump options other than Medela, you might consider taking a harder look at those.",0
We own both this and the Baby Bjorn potty and my kids prefer the toilet trainer.  My son takes puts this on and off the potty himself and he is  very proud when he knows he can do it himself.  I would also recommend buying the Bjorn step stool so your child can climb on and off the potty themselves.  Very sanitary and easy to clean (I've even stuck ours in the dishwasher).,1
"We loved this monitor for our son. When our daughter came along last year, we bought a video monitor but it interfered with our internet service. So we decided to return to what works, which is this graco monitor! We have no complaints with it at all - compact, inexpensive, and works great.",1
"a little smaller than I had imagined, but the imagination is a funny thingthe little girl in the house likes them and plays with them alotuseful as little tables too",1
Very basic and simple materials.  Looks great in my daughter's room.  She likes it so I like it! Would recommend.,1
"I used it for the first time today and it did not hold up against the wind. The velcro stickers that came with it came right off. They should be stitched on, or better yet, have velcro straps that are more secure.  It did keep the water out when it wasn't flying up, making my baby cold.  The sun shade part is good and water resistant too but since it is a flap that snaps on, it doesn't stay closed at the seams all the time and wind gets in through there.  Basically, it is not good for windy days unless you alter it yourself by adding your own straps.  I'd rather use it in the warmer months when it is not so windy for the rain and sun shade as well as the neat flying insect net that is under the sun shade.  I'll see how it holds up then.",0
"This thing is great. Very high quality, sturdy and user friendly. The base and quick connects make this thing very easy to use. Whenever I need a car seat, I will buy a Britax. No need to purchase the expensive ones either. This one is great!",1
"I really like this product, and would buy it again, but in the center, there is a connection that comes loose. If you look at the picture, you can see where the two screens come together, well that sometimes disconnects and the entire thing comes crashing down.",0
"She loves it, I love that she loves it.  She coos and talks to the big eyed plushy caterpillar and I talk to him too.  We talk at night and discuss things like Politics, dirty diapers, Pizza crusts, and all sorts of cool things.  Then he entertains my little girl and smiles all the time.Let your little one smile all the time.  Get this curly caterpillar thing-a-ma-bobby.",1
"We have had it 6 months now and my son listens to the ocean sound as he falls asleep every night and after the middle of the night feed. For some reason, 2 months ago it started shutting off after like 10 seconds of noise. At times, it will go a few minutes, but usually about 10 seconds now. I have tried changing batteries and it still does it. I might have created a bad habit using this for bed, but my son loves it and it works for us. I will be using a cheaper version of this I found locally. Everything else about this product was satisfactory. I am glad I waited a few months to write my review. Apparently this pricey product will not last long.",0
"First of all, friends have purchased and used this product and like it a lot.The following is a review of their claims on the procduct page:The Playtex VentAire Family: Pediatrician Recommended for Easy, Safe FeedingPlaytex designs their VentAire bottles and nipples to promote the semi-upright feeding position pediatricians recommend to prevent ear infections. Micro-channel vents create a consistent flow of liquid, minimizing pressure on your baby's ear canals and protecting against gas, colic, and spit-ups.  -  You should talk to your pediatrician for his/her recommendation.  But what is said about the VentAire bottle has been true.NaturalShape Nipples for Latch-OnThe wide, soft nipple designed specifically for the VentAire bottle system mimics the breastfeeding experience and latch-on process for a baby. Two nipple types--slow (stage 1) and fast (stage 2)--allow you to select the liquid flow rate that is best suited to your baby's needs. -- This again is helpful in feeding the baby.Well-Designed Bottle for Proper Feeding TechniqueEach angled VentAire bottle helps promote the proper, semi-upright feeding position that is recommended by pediatricians to avoid ear infections. -- Repeat of the the first point and still true.Patented Venting System to Reduce GasMicro-channel vents placed on the bottom of the bottle, instead of slits on the nipple, provide a consistent flow of liquid. Air enters and exits the bottle without mixing with the milk, greatly reducing gas, colic, and messy spit-ups, while also minimizing pressure on your baby's ear canals. The BPA- and Phthalate-free bottle comes in a variety of sizes so your baby can grow with the VentAire system. - This statement is also trueEasy Cleanup and Convenient, Pre-Calibrated BottlesFor added convenience, the VentAire bottles open at both ends for easy cleaning. The bottles, bottle caps, vent disks, and nipples are safe to wash on the top rack of the dishwasher or can be rinsed with hot, soapy water. Plus, the bottles feature convenient, pre-calibrated markers, so you never have to guess at how much liquid you are giving your baby at each feeding.-- The cleaning claims are true and the calibration marker is true but most other also have this.Overall, this is a very good product.",1
"These locks work very well and just as designed.  I love that you can open a &#34;locked&#34; door from either side.  They're easy to install.  I would guess you'd have to be about 4 feet tall or taller to unlock them.  I could see, if you had a REALLY rambunctious little one, he/she could pull and pull and pull on the door until the screw came out of the door frame.  We haven't had this problem at all.  Highly recommend if you're looking for an easy fix for childproofing doors.",1
"My daughter(2) and nephew(3) loved it since the first moment they saw it... I've been trying to get rid of the bottle for a long time now, and this was the only one that got them to try something else. I haven't had any problems with leaks and I shake the cup to mix the milk. At first when dinking they would leak but it's becasue since the tip is not flat whatever milk that came through and not drank by the child it would spill, but my daughter got a hang of it and won't take it out until she clears the milk that it left on the tip of the sippy so now that is not a problem any more. What can I say a time saver from washing and sterilizing bottles.",1
"You can pull the gate open while it is latched.  Don't was your money on this item, buy another gate.",0
IT'S a waste of money!!! I literally threw in the garbage after opening!!! Doesn't look nothing like pictures!!!!,0
Supposed to simulate how breast milk comes out.  They worked great for us.  After trying multiple different types of bottles these worked the best.  It limited the amount of air intake that goes to the baby and causes less gas issues and less burping needed.  Works smoothly and the kids took to them a lot easier.,1
"these sheets are great, very soft, fit perfectly, and easy to wash & dry. they come out looking like new.",1
"Since he was 2 months old, my son's been trying to stand and walk... he's one of those babies that likes to go, go, go, but gets frustrated when he can't move on his own. This jumperoo provides him with the mobility he wants, and he loves to JUMP! A few things I love about this Jumperoo:(1) Small footprint: I live in a condo so the less space it takes up, the better(2) Soft hanging animals: In other models, the animals are plastic and when you look at them from the baby's perspective all you can see are the bottoms (not very fun). My son loves to look up at the animals and tries to jump to reach them. Sometimes, he can just spend ten minutes doing that!(3) Seat rotates 360 degrees: The rotating seat gives the baby a different perspective of the room, which keeps him entertained.(4) Three springs vs. four: The baby loves to jump and to sway back and forth, and I don't think he'd be able to do that with four springs, which provide less mobility.(5)Music: The baby is easily able to activate the sound on his own by jumping, so you don't need to leave the continuous play mode on, which we all know can get annoying for mom and dad!(6) Toys: The toys on the front and sides of the jumperoo are awesome and the baby has no trouble using them.(7) Seat padding: The seat is really well padded and comfortable and the leg holes don't dig into his chubby little legs.We picked this jumperoo over newer models for the above reasons, and we haven't been disappointed! The baby LOVE LOVE LOVES it!",1
"I've had the Motorola MBP video baby monitor system (there are various models) which cost about the same price as this Philips Avent system.  My Motorola system got damaged during my move (mover's fault) so I started using this one.Both systems have a nice quality picture with good night vision.  Night vision is more important than you may realize - because for me at least, most of my use is checking on the baby when the room is dark.  And the Philips Avent system definitely wins for design - the monitor and the camera are sleek and look nice.  The blue is beautiful.  Overall, this is a 4 star baby monitor.However -  The thing I liked about the Motorola is the pan and zoom.  When my daughter was not rolling over it was less important ... because I could just set the monitor to focus on her face and then I could always see if she was awake or asleep, and watch her breathing, which every new mama wants to check on now and then for reassurance.But once she started moving around on her own or rolling over - by around 3-4 months - you want to be able to pan the camera over to where the baby is at the moment and zoom in.  If you just do a wide shot over the whole crib, you can't really see what's going on .  That close up shot of the baby's face in the picture for this product is only useful if the baby never moves.  Because if that baby rolls just a bit, you'll be looking at empty crib space with no way to get back to the baby's face.Considering that the price points are about the same, I have to recommend a baby monitor system with pan & zoom if that choice is available to you.  There is no way to remotely pan this camera if you want to change where it's pointed or anything like that.",1
"I am a new mother and received this stroller as a gift. I have now used this product for half a year. I love that the stroller can be used as a regular stroller or I can strap in my carseat. I am able to use the stroller as a shopping cart in the stores as the stroller is able to carry several items. I can go grocery shopping and load the stroller as I would a shopping cart. It is also easy to maneuver. It is so conventient that opening my own door is a breeze. It is also very lightweight as I jog with it often. Also, I get compliments about the stroller everywhere I go. It is convenient as well as appealing to the eye for a great price! ;)",1
"Love my Alva diapers , but I never got this set I totally forgot maybe I should call  and see what happened :(",1
works great! much less mess in diapers and cheap and biodegradable. easy fast soft on baby butt and daddy's wallet,1
"My daughter is 1 year.I brought this with other toys.Till date this is the best toy she has had.This is my daughters Music player cum Mobile cum Coffee Mug.Design is perfect.4 Different tunes make is fun.Very sturdy (My daughter slings this to the walls and floor when she gets angry), must have thrown it about 100 times, but still continues to play.The Design is so perfect that kids think it is a mobile, and also since kids love licking everything, this is like a coffee Mug.Worth a buy, get it for your kid, and see him / her enjoy it to the fullest.",1
This has really helped to organize my son's small stuffed animals. I would highly recommend it!,1
"Being the natural freak that I am since having my little one I had been debating back and forth on whether to get a baby food maker knowing that I would only be happy if I was able to make my own food and know exactly what was being put in it.  I had heard everybody say ""Oh...you don't need one of those fancy things.  All you need is a pot, some steam, and a fork.  That is the way we used to do it.""After looking at several brands I decided that the baby brezza looked worth the $100.  Let me say I was totally right.  This thing is awesome.  I spend about an hour or two a week (usually on a Sunday) dicing veggies and fruit, put everything into the baby brezza, push the button, and voila! Baby food complete.  I just pour it out of the canister into freezer safe containers and store it frozen for the whole week or two. It is a breeze to clean, does an awesome job making a smooth puree, and saves me tons of money by not having to buy organic baby food.I would definettly recommend this product to anyone thinking of making their own baby food.  It makes our jobs as mom's a breeze!",1
"Buy the Nuk instead because that brand does not leak.  I used the born free nipples with bottles, and that's why I went with this sippy but it leaks after times passes.",0
"I was given this tub as a shower gift.  I luv it!  I had registered on Babie's R Us' website for a collapsable tub to make storage easier, and someone also gave that to me.  But in reading some reviews on it, some people said it leaked....well back to the store that went (unopened).  I kept this one because I liked the idea of the sling for a newborn and I liked the fact that it has the stopper that is supposed to change color if the water is too hot.  Well my daughter hated taking a bath in the sling.  Each time I put her in it, she looked terrified as if she was going to fall out of it.  Eventually, she started to hang a leg off the sling as if to brace herself (it was kinda funny to see her doing that :).  But I finally decided, enough is enough and started giving her baths without the sling and she now likes to take a bath.  I like the padding for her back and the contoured floor so she won't slip.  Now, I think she really looks forward to taking a bath.  Also, because of my odd shaped kitchen sink, the tub wouldn't fit into it, so I just set this tub up in her room on her changing table with a towel under it.  It works out really great.  I am very pleased with this tub and now, so is Anisa.",1
"I LOVE this bra!  I don't know how I made it two months without it.  When I got it I was amazed at how much faster my sessions went.  When I was holding the bottles with my arms, I would sometimes lose suction when I moved around... with the hands-free bra it never happens!  I gave it a 4 only b/c the sizing is kind of whack.  According to the chart, my size should be L/XL/XXL.  However, I noticed that the XS/S/M fits MUCH better and I'm not even on the loosest setting.  So I would just suggest getting both sizes if you are borderline... Overall, SUPER product!  Every pumping mom should have one.",1
I'm convinced that all nail clippers for babies suck. Don't even bother buying any (same goes for baby nail files). We've found that tiny Swiss Army knife scissors work best. Those scissors are small and easy to operate. These clippers do not chop through baby's soft nails well and the magnifying glass on these makes the whole experience even more terrifying.,0
"I ordered this seat for my 10 month old son. He is around 19 pounds and 28in and it is perfect. He also has plenty of room to grow. I drive a Honda Accord so I was worried that it may not fit. It fits great in the the middle of the back seat. My husband is 6'1 and he can drive with the seat all the way back with no trouble. My son seems very comfortable in it also. Installation wasn't any harder than any other seat I have installed. I did have to put a rolled towel under the front of the seat to get it level, but it wasn't a big deal. Overall I am extremely happy with the seat. I will have to uninstall the seat to adjust the shoulder strap height but you don't have to do that often, so it shouldn't be a problem. I shopped around for weeks before I bought this seat and I am so glad I did. It also has a good ammount of padding, which is one thing I was looking for.",1
"This definitely helps when I give my lo a bath!  My knees and back aren't so achy now, and I can really enjoy bath time!",1
I thought my baby would like this since she wasn't taking a liking to Sophie. She didn't and this one definitely squeaks louder (and quite possibly more annoying) than Sophie. It sure is darn cute though.,0
"This diaper pail does a great job at keeping away the stink.. great is an understatement really, this thing truly rocks at keeping those nasty odors at bay. The unit was cheap, as are the refills (which can last me a week or more with size 2 diapers).Only complaint is that sometime when trying to close the lid it wont budge, you have to open the door lift the blue bag from the bottom and then close the lid. I usually take that as my warning sign that I've only got a little bit of space left but sometimes it does that when the bag is close to empty at which point you just have to re adjust it.I would totally recommend this diaper pail and would probably NEVER switch to the other, and more expensive units.",1
These are nice and large for when my daughter spits liquid peas everywhere.  The pocket is handy.  Lovely patterns too.,1
"This is great!!  I don't have a baby but used it to wash all of my fine china and crystal in my china cabinet. Especially good for champagne flutes and wine glasses....very gentle, but thorough!!",1
This is a cute crib sheet. Fits well on my kiddos mattress and so far it has washed well. I would recommend it.,1
We have had this chair for almost three years now and I still love it.  The CLOTH seat washes great.  I love that you can take the tray on and off with one hand.  The only thing I don't like is the straps.  Kinda hard to get the pad on and off for cleaning.  But my daughter LOVES this chair.  We are going to buy another one for our son because Molly doesn't want to give it up just yet.,1
I love the different styles of motion. Use it for my son and other babies in the family when they visit. They each like different patterns. For my son I play recording of me talking to him. The reversible toys keep him entertained. I often use my feet to change the settings because its so simple and easy. Especially on those days when I am extremely tired.,1
"I love the hanging organizer and the cloth baskets. They work great and keep all my baby's clothes organized and easy to find. We have a thick wooden hanging bar in our closet though...and the hangers didn't fit on our bar! I had to order a different style that fit better. The separaters didn't fit either because of the large bar, and I was bummed about that. But otherwise it's a good set. Our bar is probably about 1.5"" in diameter.",0
"Don't waste your money, the main strap broke after using it for a month!  I wouldn't suggest this product ever!",0
"We have used several of the individual components from this set for quite awhile, including thePhilips AVENT BPA-Free Bottle BrushandPhilips AVENT Formula BPA-Free Dispenser/Snack Cup.  I have seen the bottles in the store, but have always been partial to thePlaytex BPA Free Drop-Ins Premium Decorated Nurser 4 oz - 3 Pack (Colors Vary).  Having now tried the AVENT bottles, however, I am very impressed with them.I appreciate that the bottles are BPA-free, as we have been working to eliminate sources of BPA in our household for a couple of years now.  I also liked the physical size (diameter) of the bottles.  The clear nipples are great, as I had no question whether they were clean.We do not have a dishwasher, so all washing has been by hand (easy with the large bottle opening) and everything has held up well.  This set is a good way to try out the AVENT system, and contains a nice selection of items.",1
"My baby's room has absolutely NO odor because of the Diaper Champ.  The chamber holds many diapers ( a day full at least) with no odor at all.  I also love that it takes regular trash bags so it's economical.  I spray the top and handle daily with Lysol or use Clorox wipes in the receptacle to keep it sanitary, but otherwise NO ODORS leak out!  We change the trash bag daily but you could get away with two days.",1
Love this Minky Dot material. Its super soft for your little ones. Washes nicely and its easy to get on and off. Ill order another..,1
This blanket is so cute and adorable. It is not very thick but it does keep my son Very warm! The snoopy is a lot smaller than it shows but I think the size that is actually on the blanket is better so it isn't over taking the entire blanket!,1
"This is super nice for a child going into daycare.  You can put their picture on the front and have multiple family pictures on the inside of the book.  Nice to let the child know parents, siblings and grandparents when they're not there.",1
I haven't had a chance to use it.I thought this would help my granddaughter later on with her pottingn training.I also purchased a step stool to help her get onto the seat.Of course with the safety watch from her grandfather to make sure that she doesn't hurt herself.I'm quite sure this will be helpful.I like the deodorizer located in the back of the seat.,0
"It's true, it does not work as well as the diaper genie. I am going back to that. I have used both and I can assure you, this product does not contain smells - I even put it in the closet, and still we smell it! Save yourself the money.",0
"I love this sweet toy.  Skip Hop can do no wrong in my eyes.  It was exactly what I was looking for, a toy with the soft chimes.  My newborn loves hearing them can wait till he can start playing with it himself!",1
This is a wonderful blanket thick and soft well made excellent material! Will buy more for baby shower! I love it and the baby use it everyday!,1
"We got this product so we can have a portable crib when we travel overnight.  We haven't yet taken this on a trip yet but expect to do so this Christmas.  Portability and ease of setup/disassembly were important to me and the Graco Pack N Play passed with flying colors.  I took a star off because some of the accessories that I thought was included was not but it still came with plenty.Other minor quibbles...  The included changing station is certainly strong and we use it almost exclusively now, but our baby at 5 months has almost outgrown it.  In a few months, I expect her legs would dangle over the edge.  Included mobile is very basic and it would have been nice to have a windup component.  But that's pretty much it for the negatives.It's an excellent product and I recommend it.",1
"I love this gate.. it has with stood both English and French bulldogs, I am sure if they wanted to run it down and got together they could.. but it is pretty sturdy and locks nicely to seperate the rooms off.. Great gate for the money.. I think it could be a little sturdier if I didnt have to have it so wide..",1
Our daughter loves it!! It's looks great as a wall decor and our daughter likes to play with the animals too. Highly recommend it!!,1
I love these diapers. They're not too bulky and they don't stain. My son is allergic to disposables and had a rash for 6 weeks and after just two days of these diapers his rash cleared. He was nine pounds when he started wearing them and they fit him pretty good. Only problem was they were late so we had to keep using disposables longer on his rash.,1
"We love these blocks.  Our daughter started to play with these blocks at the age of four months.  She would sit in her peapod and knock them over or just gum them.  Later she started to move them from hand to hand.  Now she loves to sit and knock them over.  They are also motivating her to crawl, because she wants to knock them over so badly.  They look brand new, even after the constant chewing, stacking, and knocking down.  We have since purchase these blocks for our friends and niece.  We highly recommend them.",1
I was looking for a swing for my baby. And i found it here at amazon .And i really love it for the price.Its a good item.I recived in two days free shiping.I dont use the battery . Only the AC.This is my opinnion about the item.,1
Easy to use and my baby is comfortable. You need to put a cloth or blanket on the pillow for messes since the fabric does not come off for washes.,1
"Pretty soft pattern. Free shipping was great for such a large purchase. Top is easily removable for washing/drying, making clean-ups of accidents a breeze. Doesn't vibrate or play music. If you want that, you'll have to splurge. For $35/free shipping, this item can't be beat! Is light weight and easily movable between rooms when needed.",1
"I just want anyone who has this stroller or is thinking of purchasing it to BE AWARE that you DO NOT have to push ANY buttons and it could potentially collapse.If the stroller is EVER collapsed with the wheels in the forward facing position, it could bend the frame and from then on the stroller COULD collapse WITHOUT ANY WARNING and WITHOUT PUSHING ANY BUTTONS.This is exactly what happened to us with our 27-day-old daughter in the stroller. She suffered a skull fracture and bleeding on the brain.When it happened, we thought we hadn't secured the stroller properly, but while walking back home with our daughter in our arms, the stroller collapsed again. This is when we realized that there was something wrong with the stroller.After returning from the hospital, we contacted Baby Trend and they explained that they have had dozens of complaints of the same thing happening to others. They told us that the frame had probably been bent because it was collapsed with the wheels in the forward facing position, and this causes the stroller to collapse without warning. We couldn't see that the frame was bent, but once we looked very closely, we realized that the left hinge wasn't latching properly.We took our story to the news so others wouldn't have the same thing happen. We contacted CPSC (Consumer Product Safety Commission) and they sent an investigator to our home and are looking at the stroller for a recall. We have settled our claims with Baby Trend and our daughter is doing well.BUT.... Please BE AWARE!!!! and BE CAREFUL. If you have a complaint of injury, please file a complaint with CPSC.",0
"I love this! My daughter is now a little over 6 months and for 2 nights she has been in her big girl crib in her nursery...and I'm so sad about it. We loved co-sleeping with our daughter and this product has contributed to our joy. Not only has it helped with my first time parent anxiety about 'is she breathing', 'is she on her back', 'is she too hot/too cool' by her being right beside us at night, but it has been a super travel crib for us! We don't trust hotel cribs and when visiting family or friends who don't have cribs or playards, this has been perfect! She still fits in this co-sleeper. So we can still use it during travels for a few more months, until she can pull herself up. My parents have the mini co-sleeper and although she can still fit in it when we go to grandma's (our daughter is 16 pounds, 26 inches long now), I don't like using it because with her arms stretched out (like she always sleeps), they touch the sides and this wakes her up. So, I highly recommend if you are between this and the mini, to get this one if you want it to last a while. Her arms could touch the sides of the other at around 4 months. Now, we'll have it set up as a playard in the living room to carry outside in the backyard for summer-time fun! Great product!BTW, you don't have to buy Arms Reach sheets to fit. The major baby retailers sell a brand that fits them and it saves you about $10!",1
"My wife and I settled on this crib after reviewing several options, and we are overall happy with our purchase.  There were two options available for purchase at the time we looked: Target, which had many reviews, or ""Delta"" which had quite a discount relative to Target (at least with free Prime shipping) but had no reviews.  First we were not sure they were both the same (particularly, it was not clear from the picture if the trundle casters), but from what we could tell they were.  We took the chance with Delta, and we were happy to find out that it was the same product.Here are the few issues we found with this crib:1) The assembly of the changing table took a while because the cardboard backings would just not go into their respective positions.  I only got things to come together after applying what felt like unreasonable force, which ended up delaminating the end of these cardboard sheets.  Fortunately the exposed cardboard was not visible from a standing view, otherwise it would have been a small eyesore as the crib is dark in color.2) The right end of the headboard (the curved top piece) was not finished (smoothed/rounded) wood like the rest of the visible surfaces.  It is painted though (thankfully!)3) We were initially disappointed with the smallish appearance of the trundle. I measured the internal dimensions to be 15"" x 45"" x 4"".  However, that being said, it has been very useful for storing extra diapers / wipes.  The clearance between the bottom of the trundle to the horizontal bar that is at the bottom of the crib is 6.25"" which is wider than diaper width so is good for storing the three unused diaper bundles we get from our four-pack orders off of Amazon with room to spare.As for the assembly, my advice for the changing table is to look for the notches that are made in the lamination to fit the thin cardboard backings, and to push their edges in before trying to fit the pieces together.  Maybe try pushing the cardboard into those slots at an angle, starting at one end, and then rolling forward to get it in all the way to the end.  Trying to push that cardboard piece in to its slot straight down from the top requires quite a bit of force and may cause you to accidentally tear that flimsy laminated cardboard piece.We are using theLA Baby 4 Sided Changing Pad 30"", Whiteand it took some pushing in but it fit, also in the hamper we were able to fit this in perfectly:Honey-Can-Do HMP-01262 Pop-Up Mesh Spiral Hamper, Medium, White.update: 5 months into using the hamper as a hamper, now we use it as storage for extra bedding (sheets, blankets, quilts, swaddle blankets) because we noticed a really bad smell emmitting from the hamper, even though I only put dry clothe in there but I guess there was no ventilation so it stunk up after awhile.",1
"I bought this for my new born grandson. It looks like it it very safe and sturdy. Everything is easily adjustable unlike other brands I have tried. There is nothing negative about this carrier. It's light weight, and easy to carry at your side. The baby fits in it perfectly, nice and snug. The base is easy to mount in the cars and SUVs I have tried it in. When taking a taxi we just use the carrier itself. I was definitely the hero at the baby shower with everyone admiring the carrier.",1
"We have this along with a Little Tikes Play Cube that my mom got my son. This product is just not on the same level. The mirror on the cube is much better than the flip toy on this one. The spinner with beads on the other makes a much more interesting side. The same can be said about the pieces that run on the plastic track. As I said in the title, this is an okay toy. For a little bit more, I'd rather get the play cube that is bigger and with better toys to entertain the baby.",0
"I bought a similar type of large coverall bib for my son over a year ago at BabiesRUs. It has been a great help to keep him clean during meal times. I've been looking to buy new ones for him since the old one is getting so worn out, but just couldn't find it anywhere in stores until I found this here. It's great quality, cute design and love the size too. It's even a little bigger than my old one, which is great, since my son had grown a lot since. This is a highly recommended must have product especially for active little toddlers who are starting to learn to feed him/herself! Great price and great seller too. Very fast shipping!",1
"my son love taking his bath on this little tub ,easy to used and very cute i love it, now that i dont used it anymore ,love to give it away",1
"Update---  I have to say that  the manufacturer made it right.  They replaced the unit and although it still has the same build materials - it has been going strong in our nursery.  I added star for really good customer service.Original --This light was just ok.  It is brighter than we expected.  We wanted to use it to give some softer light to our girl's bedroom at night.  This is almost too bright for that, but it is night bright enough to read by.I am rating it 3 stars for two reasons.  One - it is made of cheap plastic.  It is very light and thin.  Think of the kind of plastic that some items are packaged in like razor blades.  That material that is really tough to open... Same material for the lamp. The second and most important reason is that after 4 months of using the lamp, it started blinking.  The light just blinks on and off.  Although the bulbs are rated for 30,000 hours - I guess ours was not one of those lucky ones.  We tried finding a replacement bulb and have had little luck.  So - for $29, we expected a little more longevity out of this purchase.",1
"I looked at a lot of entertainers before choosing the Step & Play Piano.  At first I thought they were a waste of money because they can only be used for a little while.  But my 7-month-old son is now crawling all over and too big for his bouncy seat (he leans over and tries to get out), so I decided to purchase the Step & Play.My son LOVES the toys (especially the mirror) and I love that everything is within his reach (no dropping toys from his high chair or bouncy seat).  I love that there are so many different ways to make music with it and that he can practice walking without the falling risk that a walker poses.The Step & Play is his favorite place to play and I feel good knowing he's going to stay in one place.Updated to add: My son is now 15 months old & he still loves to play with this toy, although the seat is long gone. My only complaint about this toy is that it has a one-time assembly. After it's assembled, only the seat is removable which makes it difficult to travel or store it.",1
"I disagree with the other reviewer about the material - it is pretty soft. But the item description is completely misleading. First of all, this sack will not last until 6mo. As other Halo SleepSacks, these come in Newborn (6-12lb, 19""-23"") and Small (13-18lb, 23""-26""). The one you receive is the newborn one. If your baby is on the tiny side, you might be able to use it until 3 mo. Secondly, the swaddle piece is not removable (why I bought this sack in the first place) - it is sewn in and meant to be fastened under arms, not removed. The tag does say 100% organic cotton, but the packaging is vinyl and there is a giant synthetic tag with swaddling instructions on the inside of the swaddle piece.",0
Nice sheet good quality. Shipping was not as promised though. A little disappointed on that.,0
"Love this - it's a bit time consuming to put together because every branch, animal and leaf is something you need to put together yourself, but it wasn't bad at all.  We decided to place a few things in different places, but that's what I love about it - I scattered the animals throughout the room instead of concentrating them around the tree.  The decals stuck very well, have been up for about 2 weeks now, and are still going strong.",1
"No surprises here; the gate works as expected and is easy to install and operate. If you have heavy traffic through it and don't use the screw-in positioners, you will need to readjust periodically. However, this is nothing compared to having to step over a gate regularly, and it is easy to adjust. Highly recommended.DISCLAIMER: We are using this to control access to certain parts of a house from a smart PUPPY with no thumbs. Therefore, we don't have to worry much about the gate being unlocked. If we were using this for a TODDLER, I would NEVER be comfortable leaving the secondary lock off, since it is so simple to lift the handle and open the gate.",1
"My granddaughter loves Ladybugs, anything ladybug is what she wants. She received this Ladybug Constellation Night Light, and she loves the entire set-up.It is more than a night light, stars range on the ceiling and wall. It is soft and cuddly, any child will love the light that shines. No need to be afraid of the dark, four different constellations are projected onto the ceiling and walks. The lights shut off within 45 minutes.  The LED is long lasting and stays cool. The battery pack stays hidden by a flap.There are several different animals, a hippo, a sheep, a turtle, a pig and an alligator. A different animal us possible for every child in your family. These are made well. And do not look like they can fall apart easily. I really can't find anything negative about themRecommended. prisrob 12-07-13",1
"I had been experiencing chafing and pain from the Medela brand flanges for 3 months since I began exclusively pumping, regardless of the size of flange and adding lubrication.  These flanges are much more comfortable, and I add a thin layer of olive oil to the inside of the flanges plus lanolin to my nipples to reduce friction. They've allowed my nipples to heal and haven't caused any additional pain!  They don't draw out as much milk, though, which is why I am rating them 4 stars instead of 5.  I have to pump for about 5 extra minutes, and massage/compress the milk out of my breasts with my hands while pumping in order to get close to the same amount of milk as the Medela flanges. Still, the lack of pain is worth it in my opinion.",1
I got this as a baby gift for my Great Nephew.  It is excellent quality and came very nicely packaged.  It made a great keepsake present.,1
"This is my go-to brand when it comes to diaper covers! Affordable and good quality, very few leaks and was never a result of the cover solely. Very roomy yet not bulky, fits over everything from fitteds to prefolds. Even holds lay in inserts well! My only problems is the FOE gets stained easily bc it is white, I would prefer a darker FOE or one that matches the color/ print.",1
I clicked on green and blue i have a boy and i got pink and purple im so upset. I want the blue and green ones because i really like the cup itself but i dont dare order again.,0
"This item is a must have for babies. I wish I had brought it for my older kid. Initially, my husband was against it thinking he had to get his tools out to fix the thing somewhere (that part is not clear in the description of the item), but later we saw a video demonstration and went ahead and ordered it.It is so flexible, can be hooked to any door, removed in a jiffy and put back without any nuts, bolts or drilling! As long as you have a doorway with a frame, this works. And saves your back while giving your little one great exercise. What a neat concept!The only modification we did, was to add some padding to the clamps so the paint would not scrap, if at all that happens.",1
"I was apprehensive about this product after reading the reviews; however, I'm glad I purchased it.  Bought it 3 months ago and still using it well.  It is durable and great for the price I paid for it.",1
this is the best way to have a double stroller or two single strollers.  i would recommend using two like strollers for the best results.  i use two maclaren triumph umbrella strollers and do not have one single complaint.  this product is a must have if you have two stroller-riding age kiddos.,1
"My grandchildren love this toy. They want to play it everyday. It's a great birthday game for birthday partys as well. It teaches the kids to move quickly, that time is short, and they have to cooperate with each other to pass the ""Hot Pickle"". It's kind-of-like musical chairs except that you don't need as much space or as many people to play. Everyone can hear the pickle ticking but you never know when it's going to ring so everyone passes the pickle quickly. When the pickle rings, the one holding the ""Hot Pickle"" is out of the game and no one wants to be out of the game. There is usually a lot of laughter while playing ""Hot Pickle"". Fun for pickles of all ages.",1
"This is such a cute bouncy seat. The music has two settings, and the vibration has one. It's also very light weight to take from room to room. One thing better with this bouncy seat than some others is it sits back more, the other one we had my daughters head would always lean way forward so I never used it.",1
"I use this portable potty seat w/ my newly trained 3yo.  It folds up nicely and can fit in the diaper bag or even my purse.  Like others have stated you have to position this seat at the very front of the toilet, w/ the lip hanging over the front of the toilet.  Not like seats you use at home that sit in the middle of the toilet seat.When positioned properly the seat will not slip and it works fine.  I've found it to be a little flimsly with the rear portion sagging down a bit when my son sits on it, but over all it has been perfectly adequate for our use.For the price, definitely worth it for a child who isn't quite up to the regular toilet yet.",1
These breast pads work great. The size and thickness was exactly what I needed. I would recommend these pads. I would definitely purchase them again.,1
Not what we were expecting.  We did like the crinkly pages and it is well constructed but some of the rhymes were a bit over children's word experience.  Probably would not buy it again or recommend it to others.,0
Only Work on one chanel each and in the description said that work on two chanels simoultaneous. By the price is good,0

This clock has been in the nursery since the beginning and it is very beautiful.  It is large enough so we can see it and is nicely crafted so baby can grow with it through the years.  Very nice addition to any nursery and well worth the money spent!,1
"I bought a Boppy for breastfeeding with my first son.  I still have it--it's held up very well... and to a lot of abuse.  So, I know that, in general, Boppy means a well-made product. The Boppy Play Mat is of similar quality.  It comes with a wipe-clean mat, smaller than the breastfeeding size boppy pillow, and three toys (a flower that makes crinkly noises, teething ring, and taggy ball).  You can thread the toys through loops on the pillow, or attach them to a ring like thing on the mat.Now, having said all that, I didn't expect my little guy (4-1/2 months) to like it at all.  He hates tummy time with a passion.  We also have a tummy time gym (Playskool Let's Play Together Tummy Time Gym)--and that doesn't even help. (Has music, lights, etc.)  So, I was totally shocked when he laid on his Boppy pillow and played with the toys for maybe 5 minutes.  I know, I know... 5 minutes isn't a lot... but for us, it is.  He actually really liked the crinkly sounds the toys made.  He liked the ball and he liked the teether. He's just started grabbing things in the past month, so it was nice to see that these are all really age-appropriate.  You could also easily attach other toys.  We have a bunch of Tiny Love toys from one of their Gymini mats--so used a few of those.  After propping him up, and a bit of cuddling, he was happy to go back down on the mat for a few more minutes.  I can definitely see this becoming a daily event.  The baby-sized boppy will also be good in a month or two when he starts to sit on his own.  I tried using it now, but his weight sort of pushes it out of the way.The only criticism I have is that I wish that there was some sort of velcro on the mat and a way to fold everything up so it was easy to travel with.  Yes, I can shove everything in a bag--but it would have been nice had it been designed with a travel mechanism.I will say that I've done tummy time with my eldest son, but never bothered to push it with my middle kids.  All of them have crawled just fine--and right around the same time.  So, if for some reason your baby hates it... and nothing helps... relax.  Chances are everything will be just fine. :)  So, honestly--do you need this? Nope.  But if you do want to do ""tummy time"", it really seemed to help my child.  It also gives you a nice, washable mat to take for playing on at a friend's house, church, etc.  I'll also say that the key is the size of the boppy.  The adult-sized boppy is just too big, but this is perfect.  My little guy has actually found new interest in our old tummy time gym simply by lying on the baby boppy from this play mat.  If you're creative, I'm sure you could sew a similar sized pillow (or find one on Etsy)... but for those of us who have trouble hemming pants, thank God for the folks at Boppy. :)",1
"My daughter (3 years old and loves to bite her fingernails) loved this and I thought it looked great and it was better for her to chew on this than her nails. Until the day we took a ride in the car and all of a sudden she started crying and wouldn't stop or tell me what it was about. Turns out she bit off a piece of the necklace and stuck it up her nose, so deep that I couldn't even see it anymore. As this is a product INTENDED to be chewed on I am shocked that it would be so easy to bite pieces off which makes it a choking hazard for kids with teeth and a stick-it-up-your-nose hazard as well. I'm sure this is great for small babys but as soon as your kids have teeth, it's dangerous.",0
"This is the worst potty for boys.It is really small so my 3 year old barely fits on it.He has been forced to urinate standing up (which I guess is best in the long run) because the shield squishes his parts!!!and now he is afraid of getting hurt.The potty is  not made well for boys nor does it take into consideration ""aim"" or lack of it. When my son urinates, if he doesn't get it all directly in the green pan, it leaks from in between the seat on to the floor and in between the base of the potty. This thing is disgusting. I have to take it apart and clean it every single time he pees!!!!Also, the sensor is too sensitive. It sings and says he went when nothing happened.I wish I would have spent the money on a simple potty without bells and whistles. Now all my 1 year old wants to do is play with this nasty potty. I finally threw it away and just let my son use the regular toilet.",0
Have given these as gifts at showers to 4 different expecting moms who love that they are natural products.  Feedback from them later as the babies begin teething is always very positive.  Big drool!,1
I love these sheets for our cold Michigan winter nights.  Great fit and soft too.  They hold up well after repeated washes.  Would recommend.,1
"My daughter has had this turtle for 2.5 years now. It has been durable and reliable the whole time. It is adorable and she still loves it!  Worth the price, you will get a lot of use out of it. The best part is this thing is rough and rugged and takes a lot of abuse (and sometimes love) from little kids.",1
"This was a gift that was mailed to a friend in February for her baby and she loved it. I was surprised that the company did not send mailing notices or when the gift should arrive. I found out today that she received it. I have ordered from  several companies through Amazon, and I have never experienced this situation until now.",1
"Bought this before my 2 1/5 year old grand daughter was born, it was part of her bedroom ensemble. She has always left it at my house and it is her favorite whenever she's here. Still soft and pretty, not faded after many washings.",1
"I felt in love with Maya at the Lullaby Lane, a local store, the color of gold was splendid.  They were out of stock and so I got it from Amazon instead because I couldn't wait.  I agree with most of the pros and cons mentioned here.  The only thing I would add is that when I took it to a picnic in summer, I noticed the gold was a magnet for bugs.  I was trying to fan the bees and bugs away from it, but to no avail.  I made the connection when another stroller next to ours, a green Chicco, had no bugs, and it was so through out that afternoon.  I would have chosen a different color if I knew this.",1
"These worked great, except one of the shields cracked after only a month or two of use. Even though it was cracked, I was still able to use it, although it may have affected the suction.",1
"This is a &#34;nursery in a box&#34; quite literally.With a giant 70+ pound box shipped halfway across the country, something is destined to get damaged. Unfortunately for us, the top of the headboard was cracked nearly all the way through. Not safe, unfortunately. Stork Craft has a parts department and provides the phone number, so we're hoping to get a replacement headboard as we've already assembled the dresser and changer...If the piece wasn't so noticeably broken, this set would be perfect. We didn't want anything fancy for our little boy, but we still wanted something modern and aesthetically pleasing. This fits the bill.",1
"This is a beautiful, soft, 100% organic cotton, standard size receiving blanket.  Because it is a lovely light brown, it is a great gift for a boy or a girl.  It is a good spring or fall weight, thin but not as thin as cotton muslin.Its one flaw is its size.  This blanket is 30"" x 40"", which is too small to use to swaddle.  A blanket needs to be at least 40"" x 40"" for a good swaddle but the bigger the better.  This blanket is still a good size to tuck around a baby in a carseat, drape across a shoulder to lay a baby against, and wrap around a baby who is being held.",1
"My daughter received this for her 4th birthday and it has become her constant companion.  It's extremely well made with a heavy wooden base, does not tip easily, goes fast and can spin in circles ... all around a really great and entertaining toy.  I love how compact and rounded it is as we don't have much space, it lets her have a ball indoors while it's too hot to play outside and she's just figured out she can steer by leaning her body weight and make the mouse spin.  I did see comments about these being 'small', my daughter is tall and lanky and has no problem zipping around on her mouse :)  I've oddly also seen comments about the wheely bugs being too big or hard to use - these are definitely only for children that can put their feet flat on the ground and push themselves with confidence because these babies MOVE, they're on free moving casters and roll way quicker than most other plastic push/ride on type toys.  I have a newly walking baby in the house that likes to push the mouse around sideways but it gets away from him pretty easily, this is not a push toy for babies for sure!",1
I liked the OXO Tot Booster seat. We bought in taupe to macth our furniture. Our 18-month also likes it. This seat does not have a strap to belt in your child. This works fine for us but other parents should be aware of this. It folds very nicely and looks great. Easy to clean and store. It also is pretty stable on the kitchen chair. My son who is 25 pounds slides on and off all the time but the booster seat stays put.,1
This saved us from continuing to supplement formula with my newborn. It can be a little tricky at first but It kept baby at the breast to get my supply back up after almost losing my milk supply from an infection. We were able to wean from supplements over just a few days using this and have been exclusively breastfeeding without it ever since! Baby is now 7 months :),1
Purchased 2 of these for the top and bottom of our stairs.  They work great to keep my son upstairs or downstairs.,1
"THESE LOCKS ARE AWFUL.  I'm so glad that I'm not the only one who thinks so because these are so hard to use.  I had to struggle to get them open to begin with, and it took like almost 10 minutes to wrestle it off of my cabinet after I put it on. Such a waste of money.",0
"These work for their intended purpose, but I'm not too happy about how they look.  I don't know if there are better looking options available though.",0
"Tommee Tippee is the third bottle we have tried.  My daughter has had terrible gas since she was born and even sucks in air while nursing.  I bought Avent bottles before she was born but discovered BreastFlow from The First Years and bought those because I was afraid of nipple confusion.  She sucked in so much air with the Avent we only used one of the nearly 30 bottles we have!  The BreastFlow were definitely better than Avent but she still got quite a bit of air.  Our pediatrician recommended adding a little rice cereal to her bottle to help with her reflux so we went out in search of something we could give the cereal through (the BreastFlow bottles have two nipples and the milk mixed with cereal wouldn't come out).  I still wanted something that she would be comfortable switching between bottle and breast so we decided to try these.  She LOVES her new bottles!  I did have to cut one of the nipples to use with the cereal mix but they were the newborn nipples so a faster flow might work better for that.  She does great using the non-cut nipples with straight breastmilk.  My husband even commented last night that she was eating more like she was nursing, much more relaxed! Tommee Tippee = Happy Mommy!",1
"Very pleased with this purchase. The crib is beautiful and sturdy. I love the espresso color. It would be nice if the changing table were detachable, but we probably wouldn't detach anyways so it`s really not a big deal. It took my husband and brother-in-law less than 2 hours to assemble. The only negative comment I have is that there was very strong, strange smell the first couple of days that must have come from the packaging or factory, but after a couple of days of using the air purifier it was better. I would recommend this crib to a friend. The price on Amazon was significantly less than the stores.",1
"This is a fantastic product for potty training and beyond that, to general travel!  It is slim and light and fits easily in the bottom of the stroller or diaper bag.  My daughter was frightened of falling into public toilets and would refuse to use the bathroom, often resulting in an accident, however she has no problem using the potette plus as a smaller insert in public toilets or as a small potty when we are not close to a bathroom.  I just have it handy whenever we are out.I carry a small packet of antibacterial wipes with the seat and quickly wipe is over before putting it back in the waterproof bag.  If you use it with the potette plus bags as a potty, the bags are large enough to ensure there is no ""mess"" on the plastic seat, only the legs that come into contact with the ground.  When I use it as a toilet insert, I always put a paper seat cover down first.The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is that I sometimes struggle to collapse the legs after it's been used as a potty, everything else is perfect!!!",1
"Two words only!!! LOVE IT.... And high recommended it goes perfect with the color of my baby crib, plus it makes laundry easy because it has a laundry bag that comes off.",1
"Case in point why to only order from Amazon.com and not individual sellers, unless you have not other choice.I wish I'd written this as a seller review, but in my procrastination this will have to do.  Apparently, pregnant women (sorry honey) can be fickle about the pillows they snuggle with.  This body pillow was no exception. We wanted to return it, but the seller (LegLuxe) said it would cost $60 bucks for the shipping back! C'mon!Amazon.com lets you return just about anything, minus the very few exceptions they outline. Additionally, Amazon will pay for your returns.",0
"they were amazed, and loved it, they could go to kitchen or bathroom and just in the yard and watch the baby. wonderful",1
"My daughter received this as a gift and I was pleasantly surprised. My daughter is 9 months old and is facinated by the stars on the ceiling. My 3 and 5 year old nieces also love it.  I usually place it on our spare bed or on our bed. It also works great if my daughter wakes up at night. I'll turn it on and the subtle light is great and will automatically go off after 45 minutes.  It is soft and light weight. She likes to play with it during the day, too!  I would't say it is a necessity, but it is cute for a child who has everything.",1
"Came exactly as described, shipped fast.  If you are further along in your pregnancy, i would suggest getting a bigger size.  With your ipod in the pocket, its gets a little tight.  It works great though.  the sound comes out really well.",1
"Each of my three kids have a twilight animal; ladybug, turtle, and this sea turtle.  The only thing that I will mention that no one else seems to have said is that the pictures around the sides do not project onto the ceiling.",1
"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT buy this product!!!!!!!!!!!!! The tub is made of PVC vinyl which is also known as  the """"poison plastic"""". PVC is NOT a safe material. Please read up on PVC and it's effects on the human body if you aren't sure about it. I think you will be blown away by what you read. I contacted the company and they said that this tub meets government regulations. Unbelievable that the government doesn't insist that companies use safer materials for the children and the environment.",0
"These blankets are cute and pretty soft.  However, after washing, the animals feel a bit rough and stiff.  I got them because they're organic but I don't think they're worth the extra cost.  I hate to say it but the non-organic muslin blankets I got are much softer and better quality.",0
Easily installed and works great with our 46 inch flat screen Aquos. Definitely sturdy and makes me feel safer when the baby is near,1
Our son loves to sleep in these sacks.  We have had this one for several months and it is holding up well.  He also loves the truck on this one.  We have this lightweight one as well as the fleece one.  We like them all.  He can walk in these as well.,1
"The brag book holds 4 by 6 size pictures and also matches the Happi Baby Book &#60; which we loved !  Happy,Happy,Happy!!!!!!!!",1
"these sheets are super soft and snuggly. also, i have had 3 sets alternating for the past YEAR and with a little oxy clean on stains, they still feel and look GREAT.  honestly, i bought them because of the price, but i'm glad i did!",1
"I bought this several weeks ago for my very tall 6 year old.  Works great - allows me to fit all three kids across the back seat of our 2000 Plymouth Neon when necessary.  Some reviewers have complained that it is hard to get into/out of, but I have not found this to be the case at all.  It is very easy to use.  My 6 year old is able to strap in the velcro, buckle the vest, buckle the car seat belt and fit the belt through the guide clip without any assistance from me, and is able to finish as quickly as my other 2 children (1 older and 1 younger) can buckle up in their 5 point Britax car seats.  (Full disclosure: I do leave the vest in the car with the belt already threaded through the shoulder and one lap guide.)  I'm glad I didn't let comments about how difficult it is to use sway my decision - this is a great product.  We use it every day, multiple times per day, and each time we use it I'm even more convinced that we made the right choice.  The only negative thing for me is that you can't buy the dual tether online, and we're awfully close to the 60-pound limit of the single tether.  I contacted the company asking where I can buy a tether, and they emailed me an order form to fill out and fax back to them.  I wish I could just buy it here on Amazon.When we outgrow our Britax Frontier 85 seats, I'll be buying two more of these vests.  GREAT product.",1
"Have had these less than three months and just tossed the last one in the garbage due to cracked lid, hence one star. The other star is because they're cheap. But as usual, you get what you pay for. Tupperware tumblers are more expensive but last a lifetime and are therefore a way better value and work better. The only other good thing about these is it's hard to find sippy cups without messy straws or hard to clean stopper mechanisms, so thank you for making a simple product.",0
"The brest friend I bought came with a green fleece cover.  While the cover was soft, it frequently left my son's head sweaty (particularly in the early days where breastfeeding sessions could last an hour or so).  I bought this cover for a backup when the other cover was in the wash.  I wanted to something without the fleece so it would be cooler with the warmer months coming.  This is definitely a lighter weight cover, though a sturdy and durable fabric.  I haven't had any issues with my son's head getting sweaty even when he's on it for hours at a time (gotta love cluster feedings).  As another user commented, the fabric is somewhat stiff, but it doesn't seem scratchy and doesn't seem to bother my son who frequently falls asleep at the end of the nursing sessions.  The cover washes up nice and fits the pillow perfectly.",1
"I am usually against things made of plastic, even though those without BPA. So I choose these bottles for my baby and so far so good. The only downside is that the slow-flow nipples flow too fast for him and he chokes on them. I had to purchase nipples to fit these bottles and it's hard to find the right ones. I ordered some Dr. Brown standard nipples, hoping to fit the bottles well.",1
"I am very disappointed and feel I wasted almost $400. The breastshields don't angle down so if you're sitting back at all the milk doesn't flow into the bottles (I had to go out and buy a different kind of shield that angles down). Second, there's a gap in the connecting parts so whenever I bend forward slightly the milk spills out all over the floor, which means you can't really do other things while you're pumping. Last, the hands free system doesn't fit lme--it presses my breasts flat and inhibits the milk flow. Last, the Freestyle isn't interchangeable with other Medela tubing, so when I rented a hospital-grade Medela I had to buy a whole separate kit to use it. I don't have anything to compare this to, but have been very unhappy with my pump and wish I could get my money back.",0
This is such a nice Pack and Play! The newborn napper and the changing pad attached is a wonderful addition. The napper is very comfortable for my baby Overall I am very happy with my purchase,1
"And I do too.  It was not a difficult install into my car which was a big plus.  He seems comfortable in it, but I must say when he falls asleep his head droops in this style of seat which I don't like to see.  Otherwise, it's a keeper.",1
"I must say this product is top notch. We are amazed at the optional it comes with (3 different Lullabies, temperature notification etc...). Most importantly it work perfectly as a monitor as it only transmits when there is sound in the room, getting rido of any static noise. Highly recommended! The only reason I don't give it full stars is that it does not have an option for Celsius temperature reading and only come in Fahrenheit and living abroad we have to calculate the temperature.",1
"Fit the safety 1st playpen bassinet perfectly! The pad that the playpen originally came with was rock hard, now baby is happy and comfy when he sleeps",1
Love this drying rack. I use it mainly for pump parts and milk storage bottles. It holds a ton and is MUCH sturdier than the previous one I had by The First Years (spin rack).,1
I was so excited to order this and make hand prints for my son's baby album.  It didn't work out that way.  The ink was all over my hands before even getting to the baby.  My husband held the baby still but the ink was all over his outfit.  I gave up before even trying to get a hand print.  I used the wipe beforehand as suggested but the ink wouldn't come off his or my skin for about a week.  It was a horrible experience so I just threw out the kit.,0
"I've experience similar problems mentioned in other reviews. The monitors work well at first. After a few months, both monitors won't hold a charge so we had to plug them in from room to room. After 6 months, one monitor stopped working, and today, just over a year old, the second monitor died.",0
"We got this for our daughter to put in the grand daughter's room. It does all the description says it will and just what she wanted from it. The price was good as well, for all the features it has.",1
I have read some reviews before buying this one. Some of them mentioned the brush is too big for small bottles like Medela. I don't agree. I am using it with these small bottles. It works for me.,1
"they have a nice, soft lavender cover that is washable and the cover has a snap to keep the shape round or a half-moon. very comfortable.",1
My daughter first played in one of these at a friends house. She liked it so much I went home and ordered one for her. She loves it! I would recommend it to anyone.,1
"Perfect fit, nice thickness, plush, exactly as described.  Used in a jenny lind cradle.  The mattress is not plush at all, so this cover adds the extra softness that baby needs.",1
"I like this stroller!First was Hartan Racer GT, but for toddler city versa is better!Max length of the sit is more than 1m!My daughter loves it)",1
"We started using this seat when my son grew too big for his infant carrier around 10 months old. From what I found online, this seat had great safety reviews, so I was happy to purchase it. The seat has a good amount of padding and was not too difficult to install. I love how the straps adjust using the turn-knob on the side so we don't have to pull them through the back of the seat like we did with our infant seat. This feature was especially helpful during spring when my son's clothes would vary in thickness.The only complaint I have with this seat is the straps themselves. I find that they do become twisted easily, as another reviewer mentioned. I also think that the height adjustment on the straps does not stay in place. I end up readjusting it nearly every time I put my son in the car. However, this is very easy to do, so I don't mind much.I would definitely recommend this seat to others.",1
"Overall, this monitor is great.  The video quality is on par with other monitors I have seen, and audio is quite responsive.  I especially like the button on top of the receiver which allows you to easily toggle video on and off.The negative:- This is a 900MHz monitor, not 2.4GHz, which means it is incredibly succeptible to interferance, which kept my wife and I awake a lot of the night. We've tried moving the monitor around to different locations in the home, but to no avail.  The interference manifests itself in short, half-second bursts of static, which occur every 2-3 seconds or so.- Bulky.  The receive is quite bulky.  When wearing it on your belt, it is easy to knock off on the floor.- To charge the receiver, one must plug it in via a power jack on the side.  I would prefer it if this unit charged via a charging cradle like other similar units, as this option helps avoid pulling power cords and wearting out the charging jacks.Overall, decent monitor, however I would highly recommend you spend a bit more money and get a ""digital"" monitor.",0
The sun shades didn't really stick to my windows.  It did at first but it seems like once they get wet or if you have to clean them they don't have the same &#34;ez-cling&#34; feature.,0
"This unit is all one would expect. Works as advertised. We suffered with a Sony unit for a bunch of years - always crackling, popping and mediocre sound quality. This V-tech is just wonderful. Downplays the ambient background fan noice, quiet except when sounds occur that you need to hear. The ability to talk back through the baby unit is a great plus - like a walky-talky. We've had the V-tech now for a couple months and are very pleased.",1
"I did a lot of research before I purchased this item and as soon as it arrived I spent a half hour verifying that it was, in fact, a real Ergo carrier and it is.  This is one of their newer versions (different buckle and logo) but everything matches what a real Ergo should have.  I'm extremely pleased with this purchase because the price was AWESOME!  The carrier itself is great as well.  Super easy to use and I prefer it over other carriers I've used (ring sling, Bjorn, etc) since my son is only 5 months old and already weighs 18 lbs.  It's also easy to nurse him in it too which is a huge plus for me.  The quality is fantastic and it's super cute.  I really like the Galaxy Grey too because it's gender neutral and my husband can wear it.  Highly recommended!",1
"I should have trusted the other reviewers and purchased a different alarm clock.This one is functional but does not function in a ""user friendly"" way.There is no way to adjust the volume, and the only time the light comes on is when the alarm is sounding.",0
This is a great product. Something we couldnt live without in our household. Our son is 8 months old and will sit in this chair clamped to our kitchen counter for hours playing with toys and watching me cook. I know he is secure and safe and dont have to worry about what he is getting into as I prepare dinner. The chair is also very easy to pack up and take on the go with a built in bag under the seat. A must have!,1
I've heard from many new parents that they've been struggling to find good monitors.  This monitor was the first one I bought and I absolutely love it.  Now if they could only come up with extra thing like electric discharge that would wake up my husband :)),1
"My granddaughter really liked these because of all the different color stripes.  They have held up well after repeated washings.  They are pricey for what you get (a colored tube), but they can be worn as the child grows so that is less an issue than with something outgrown quickly.",1
"We heard bad stories about the diaper genie and decided to go on a recommendation for the ""Champ.""  Boy, are we glad we listened. I go out of my way to bring smelly diapers to the champ instead of walking them outside to the trash bin.  Definitely worth the investment and very easy to use - especially in the middle of the night.",1
"I got this for my daughter for the new grandson, she raves about it and uses it all the time. Not just &#34;gee, I like this&#34; but &#34;oh my gosh this is so amazing and useful, I don't know what I would do without it&#34;. She has commented on the quality of the product as being top notch too.",1
"We bought it for our very first child. Quality and safety was our primary concern and this BabyBjorn product gave us both. The lumber supporting design makes carrying your baby around fun for you (and your back) and the baby. Definitely the best part of the design.Our 7 month old absolutely loves it. Its been money well paid for us when we see our daughter having fun and enjoying herself held close to us. We have so far used it for hiking,everyday chores and shopping and can't be more happy. Highly recommended.",1
"FTM here - looking forward to having this baby in a few weeks, but also looking forward to rockin' my new diaper bag! I haven't been working during this pregnancy, so I have been analyzing and over-analyzing every single product that we plan to use in our parenting.After decided to get just one gender-neutral bag for my husband and I to share, I was given a surprise shower and we received a really awesome dad-bag! It is perfect for my husband and just what we'll need for more adventurous excursions with baby.In the meantime, however, my husband convinced me to go ahead and splurge on a girlier bag for myself, since I will have primary care of the baby and carrying this bag around on a daily basis. After checking out bags in stores and online, I decided against childish patterns and colors (you know the ones I'm talking about!) and opted to look for something a little more mature while still functional and feminine.Which brings me to timi & leslie. Not all of the review on their bags are great. But the reviews on the Rachel bag were - so I decided to go for it. And with free returns on Amazon, how could I not give it a shot? I considered the red color but went with the taupe - it's still very rich and I think goes with more. The day I received the shipment, I immediately unpacked, prepped, and filled this baby up. I love a good shoulder bag, a good messenger bag, and a good designer bag - I basically keep a collection that fill those needs. But a diaper bag that fills all of them? AND will keep every single baby item I need organized and close at hand? Seriously - this bag does it all, and comes with every accessory you'll need to boot.Since I got this bag a few weeks ago, I've been using it as my regular large purse, opting for a smaller clutch when I don't need so much. Oh, and by the way? I still have 3 weeks to go before we actually use this as a ""diaper"" bag. timi & leslie - you have made me one happy mama-to-be!",1
I ordered these wipes after purchasing bumGenius wipes directly from cottonbabies. I was pleased with them so I decided to order some from Amazon. Very disappointed!! Either they changed the design or these are fake. The ones I ordered from cotttonbabies are stitched perfectly. They are thin but that's what I wanted. Very soft.The ones I ordered from Amazon are poorly stitched to the point that the stitching is actually coming loose from the fabric. The tag is also in a different spot then my other ones. I recommend buying them directly from cottonbabies as these ones seem to be fake. I will not be going through this seller for an future purchases.,0
"We have two.  Works great, but the older one (6 months old or so) is sticky so it takes some effort for even adults to pass.  The newer one is perfect, but who knows if the &#34;stickiness&#34; develops over time.  Still, easy to install and I obviously like it since I bought a second one.",1
"Beautiful product, and an incredible price! This was easy to use with one person holding the baby and the other taking the prints. Very nice.",1
"I don't know what I'd do without these storage cups! I love the tray the cups fit in because it allows me to store multiple cups in the fridge and freezer without cluttering the space. They also store 2-3 servings of food so I'm not constantly making more and they keep the food from getting freezer burnt. They are also microwavable, dishwasher safe, and super easy for travel which all make my life with an infant easier!",1
I was incredibly excited to recieve these items after reading the other 3 reviews yet HIGHLY disappointed once we recieved/used them.  I have tried everything to get these to glow for longer than an hour and have had no luck.  These were a huge waste of money. The ones I recieved are duds! Any suggestions?,0
"I bought this set for my two year old big girl room. After reading the reviews I was worried about the quality, but I have to say I am very happy with it. The comforter is very pretty, the colors are nice and it's washed well so far on delicate. The sheets and pillow case are also very nice. They aren't cotten but I had expected that after reading previous reviews. My daughter loves it and is excited to sleep in her princess bed so it was well worth the purchase.",1
Met all our expectations.  It was great!!!! Glad we ordered online instead in store we saved a bunch of money,1
obtained this for my grandaughtershe used it multiple times when first brought outwhen i turned music mechanism insisted on using it againrapture waned but enjoys using it and loves hearing the potty songnot giving it a 5 due to seat doesnt come up as smooth to emptybut that is nitpickingalso cute enough to leave sitting out,1
The window wedge is great for not only security but for baby proofing. With the edge in place you can not get the window open.,1
These are great blankets to use for swaddling and just for covering up the baby.  They are soft and hold up well after washing.  The 220 thread count is excellent.  This is a must Buy!,1
"My pediatrician told us at 3 months we'd have to spend thousands of dollars and get our baby a helmet if her flat head didn't change within a few weeks. My dad ordered this for our baby. I was a little skeptical, but after only a couple weeks I could see an improvement. Our baby is now 6 months old and her head is perfect. We only use it in her bed, but she still sleeps only on her back and doesn't roll yet to her tummy. We also have a monitor that we watch her on to make sure she is safe. Once she starts rolling I will discontinue using this at night.",1
"Excellent for attaching teethers or toys to anything: high chair, bouncy chair, shopping cart, stroller, car seat--or you can just hold the other end. Keeps toys from falling all the way to the floor keeping then clean in a public place and is quieter (we use ours in church) than a loud clunk on the floor. Holding the other end in your hand makes it easier to retrieve dropped toys when baby is your lap. I shared this pack with my daughter, keeping some myself to use with my granddaughter. Love them!",1
Absolutely LOVE the Cloud B Constellation Lights.  The ladybug one is perfect for girls and the turtle one for boys.  It's also educational teaching little ones about constellations.  They stare at the lights until their eyes can't stay open anymore and then they fall fast asleep.  Very soft lighting for anyone who has a fear of the dark.  It looks cute too and compliments a child's bedroom.  My grown son even joked and asked me to buy one for his room!,1
Not very pleasing to look at but does the job. The stars that hang on top are too high for newborn to see. The music is ok except for the singing. Its kind of freaky. I never use the light or vibration feature. Also I dont use the inclince because I feel its too soft and puts baby into a very awkward position. Its a pain to switch from rocking bottom to wheels because you have to get the floor and do each wheel one by one which isn't a problem but it isn't sobering you can do quickly while baby is lying in it.. Overall just ok...,0
"This is a terrific car seat. Everything you read about it is true. Solid and sturdy, lots of padding including the sides with impact protection. The conversion from harness to belt will be a snap and the harness gives my wife peace of mind until our daughter outgrows it. The only thing I wish it could do is have an adjustable back so that it can be angled back. However, its made in a fully upright locked position and probably for safety. My daughter's head flops down when she's asleep, but kids can sleep in almost any kind of position without affecting them, so no harm there. We dont use the circular cushion thats on the buckle because it slides off everytime my kid comes out of the seat. Doesnt affect the safetyof functionality one bit.If you have the means and are serious about quality and safety, get this seat! You wont regret it. And for all those parents who worry about people saying its a pain to get this car seat in and out of the car: DONT BE. Its a car seat, people! You secure it and leave it alone. Why would you NEED to move it around so much??? If you are going to do that, get a more flexible, lighter seat and dont complain about this one just because its designed for safety in mind.",1
"When my daughter was on the WIC program we would get packaged food for free. Now that she's older than one, we don't get this anymore. She's now also super picky and prefers the packaged, liquid food that she's been used to. I got these so that I could start making my own food at home, and I'm so happy that I did. It's MUCH cheaper than buying in-store and the packs are very convenient. Below are the reasons why I love this product.CLEANING: It's very easy to clean. After each use I put in some water, close the top, shaking it up and let it soak for a little bit. Then I stick a bottle brush in there and it gets nice and clean.FOOD: I love that they offer recipes on their website, so definitely check that out if you can. I also just look at the combinations that I see on pre-prepared packages and copy those. My daughter's favorite combination is anything with mango because it's sweet and yummy, so I've been doing mango and spinach as well as mango and carrots. I also like to buy applesauce and mix that with other veggies.CUSTOMER SERVICE: The customer service is also wonderful. When I first received these the top seal on one of the packages instantly broke, even though I followed the directions to open the spout and blow into it. I went to their website, e-mailed them, and they e-mailed me back very promptly. I only asked for one replacement for the one that was broken (the other three were fine) but they gave me an entire other package for free in exchange for me sending the defective product back so they could see the problem. I see this as very responsible on their part.ACCESSORIES: I highly recommend getting the spout for this product. Although we had our own spouts, I found that they would slip out. The spout that they sell is formatted to their product and the bottom part is made of silicone, so it doesn't slip out and fits perfectly on top.",1
"Your baby will love this, Night or day. Three different sounds and will light up and rotate.  Highly recommended. Great!",1
"This is perfect for people who travel, and or put next to the bed during naptimes. This was easy to put together.",1
"This is a great product for the money! I had no problems with it, and I used it for a solid six weeks since my newborn wouldn't nurse. I found it easy to use and clean. No problems.",1
Great idea but poor design. Looks super cute but leaks from everywhere! Should have taken the other review into consideration.,0
"This is a nice size rain cover but I wish they came out with one that is longer.  I've got an Eddie Bauer travel system stroller and it's big. The rain cover does not cover all the way down to his feet, only up to the knees.  I have to clip the bottom of the cover to the stroller so that the wind doesn't blow in.  Other than that this is the longest cover I've seen.  Wish they can come out with a longer one!",1
"Love it so far, the suction bottom of the bowls is an awsome idea to keep the food from spilling. The only down side is all the spoons were pink and I have a boy, but it does say 'colors may vary' so can't complaint. Overall this set is very good, I'm sure I will be using it for next few years.",1
Love the crib set I purchased for my new Grandbaby.  I could not find exactly what I wanted until I got on Amazon,1
If you need to be working while you pump this is a necessity.  Bought according to the size chart and its just right.,1
"It is a tad too tall for me, but works great.  IYou can slide it out when needed, otherwise, it is out of the way.",1
"just loved these grips, perfect for our grandson so he dosen't have to touch the handles on the carts, thank you",1
My twins are at a stage where they chew on everything. Some things really shouldn't be in their mouths. I put one of these in their bed and keep one out during the day. They do not protest when I take something out of their mouth and replace it with one of these teethers. They do occasionally protest when I take the one in their beds away after bedtime/naps.,1
These were easy to install in the vehicle. I adjusted the straps before they were installed so that was simpler. I did that after ready other reviews.,1
this breast pump didnt have any suction to get any milk out. i wouldnt recomend anyone to buy this product!!!,0
A good way to see what you're doing without turning all of the lights on and disturbing your spouse/baby in the middle of the night,1
"It's a good cute clock, I like that the eyes swing left to right. Downside when it arrived the hour arm popped off, goes right back on and was easy to take apart but still it was a bother to have to fix it.",1
this bag is perfect for keeping soiled cloth diapers contained in my diaper bag. it locks the smell in and doesn't leak. it is also machine-washable and hang-dries pretty quickly in the sun. the small bag can fit about 3-4 inserts (i use g-diapers). i'm planning to get a larger size to use for wet swimsuits and beach gear also. i would highly recommend this bag for anyone using cloth diapers!,1
"I thought that the eyelet was just a little frilly for a boy, but the baby's mom thought it was perfect!",1
I love this product. So easy to use and clean. Definitely worth the money. I will be buying this as gifts for my friends.,1
"I bought this bag to be used as a book bag for college. I wanted lots of pockets to hold soda/water bottles, calculator, pens, pencils, books, keys, etc. This bag has it all and plenty of room for four full sized textbooks and a five-subject spiral notebook. Is awesome! Doesn't even look like a diaper bag.",1
"We enjoy the static free nature of this product, however I wish it had a greater volume range. If there is any noise in the room, you need to rely on the blue lights to signal you to check on the baby.",1
"The color and size is as expected. I like the yellow color with grey mix since my nursery room is in grey. Material is better than I thought. The blanket does have flowers and birds (I did not realized that it had birds). This will be great for my girl, a bit girly for boys I think.",1
"I'm very pleased with this product. It's really-really soft, and super absorbent. It's quite long, so it fits different sizes. The bag looks nice too and could be reused for a gift.",1
"After considering my choices between other walkers and stationary saucers, I bought this walker.  Our son has been using it for about a month and he loves it!  He's only 4 1/2 months (but very big and strong for his age), and he speeds across the kitchen floor... watch our for your toes and the cat lying on the floor!  The wide base of the walker makes it impossible to be tipped. The arm on the back makes it easy to move the walker from room to room when the baby is not in it.  Right now we put toys on the see-through tray for our son to play with.  In another month or so we'll add the activity tray and our son will think he has a whole new toy.  The only drawback we've found it that our son can't move it on the carpet (not sure if that's typical of all walkers or if our son just isn't strong enough yet).  The option of making the walker stationary is a nice feature as it can be used for a feeding chair; however, our son knows that the walker can move and gets upset when he can't move it, so the stationary feature probably won't get any use by us.  If you're looking for a sturdy, entertaining walker, this one is well worth the money.",1
my daughter absolutely loves this toy. She's just learning to grasp objects and loves the crinkle sound this toy makes. I love that it's big enough for her to interact with and is visually stimulating.,1
Got a Boppy.  Didn't help.  Got a Brest Friend.  Changed my life!  This is the most FANTASTIC breast-feeding product on the planet.  Just bought some more to give as shower gifts.  I'm now a Brest Friend evangelist.,1
Very nice bibs. Wish they came in shades of pink and purple. One bib lasts all day. Love the box,1
"Bought this for my 5yo 45lb son for a trip to Disney World. Sturdy, light-weight and worked great. The only shortcoming is that the canopy supports are flimsy and may not last long, otherwise 5 stars.",1
I got this pillow for my 3 year old. IT is both adorable and comfortable my 3 year old and baby both love it!,1
"Baby loves this teether. Nice to have something different from all of the other teethers out there. The nice thing is that when she no longer wants it to vibrate, she still has fun the with handle the spins. Great product and it has lasted despite being thrown all around.",1
"These are very nice, quite thick compared to others (hence the price) but also the little blanket is amazing soft bright colored and simply adorable....love it...",1
Perfect package and great value. Packaged similar to an Apple product and also comes with a headphone splitter so that Mom can also enjoy the sounds being played for baby.Product was PRIME ELIGIBLE...all the better.Highly recommend you check out BellyBuds website as well.,1
"A friend recommended that I buy the Medela In style pump, which had the motor built in the tote. I used it a few times before I accidentally blew the fuse (due to different voltage) while we were in Asia. I decided to replace it with the Freestyle because I wasn't completely satisfied with the built in motor in the ugly tote.  I am so glad that I spent a little more and upgraded because I love this one!! First off, I've never used the tote because I find it very unstylish and instead I carry it in my regular purse.  It's also ultra light and portable for traveling. It could also be battery operated with a long battery life and I found that to be very useful. I've used it in airports and on the plane and it's hassle-free. The breastshields are comfortable too as they are the ones that are more soft and flexible.I highly recommend spending more and getting the Freestyle rather than the other models because you will get tons of use out of it!",1
I like how these were made out of milk cartons.  They are very sturdy and great colors. Will be buying more.,1
This is by far the best thing that I could have found.  I have tried all bottles and nipples and pacifiers and my baby girl is strictly mom.  My baby (10 months old now)  still wants to nurse at night and nothing else would sooth her besides mom but I was not getting any sleep.  My sister in law showed me these and my baby girl loves it!  Now I have a little bit more freedom and more sleep.  The nipple is just like the real thing.  So happy!,1
"Very pleased with the chair, though it was slightly difficult to put together. Thank you for the quick turn around.",0
i thought 6 oz. was the most you could fit in a bag of any brand.  love these for fitting 12!!!  makes pumping and storing just that much easier and faster b/c i'm getting out less bags all the time and having less stored up overall.  bags are strong and marked well.  great product!,1
"I know it sounds silly, but I cringe when I see parents put their baby/ toddler's food directly on a restaurant table - a table that has been wiped down with the same restaurant washrag that they've used on all the tables. Yuck. These things are great because you just put it on the table ( like a big disposable sticky note) in front of your toddler and put their food on top of it. Perfect. It keeps your child's food clean and helps with clean up. A great product that I highly recommend if you like to eat out with little ones.",1
"We had purchased other strollers that were a LOT more expensive, and researched even more options before buying this. We found many of these more expensive 'top of the line"" strollers to be unnessecarily cumbersome and awkward, with way too many attachments and features. This stroller is simple and convenient, can almost be folded up with one hand, is lightweight enough for my wife to get it in and out of the trunk on her own, and folds up pretty flat. It also works very well with our Snugride Carseat without having to add any adapters or attachments.The handle adjusts for height  - I'm 6'3"" and my wife's 5'5"" and it's comfortable for both of us. The front wheels can be locked into place very easily for uneven terrain.All in all, a great purchase!",1
My boy is 13 months old and he started learning to use spoon to get food to his mouth. However all the bowls we have at home is not helpful for him to get food using spoon. But this bowl is perfect for him to scoop!!,1
I like that the plug folds in for portability but the item feels very cheap plastic.The biggest issue is that the batteries really do not fit.  I have to forcibly wedge them in and pry them out.  This is sure to break the unit eventually and until the is just a hassle.,0
"In the interest of full disclosure, I just spent the better part of an hour trying to calm my daughter (for the second time) after putting her in this carrier.  That being said, I'll try to be as objective as possible.First the pros, this carrier does hold her close to my chest in an upright position.  Our daughter normally likes this position; however, I can tell she's being crushed by this design, and it's nearly impossible to adjust properly.  Sure, there are a plethora of straps and buckles to mess with, but inevitably, positioning is based on a single, loose sliding buckle attached to the back straps, which is the same part that caused the original RECALL.  Because there is no way to lock this buckle down, as we move around, the carrier sinks lower and lower in the front making her even more uncomfortable.  Additionally, the only way to slow down this process is to crank the straps down, which severely inhibits my ability to breath regularly.  My current ""solution"" is to attach two binder clips to the back straps, just below the buckle, but this is a seriously jury rigged solution, and for $100+ retail, one would think they would have used a buckle that latches.To add to her discomfort, the head support for a newborn is ridiculously tight, and she can barely move her head from side to side, so her chin is crammed into my chest.  Who wants to sleep like that?At any rate, I wouldn't even consider buying any version without the lumbar support, as those will wear out your back in about 10 minutes (we tested this in-store).  As it stands, it's a pretty rough ride, even with lumbar support.In short, unless you like flushing money, a screaming baby, and crushed ribs, I'd look into a Mei Tai style carrier, such as the KOZY CARRIER for half the price.  If you really want crushed ribs and such, you can always get an originalEvenflo Snugli Classic Carrier - Khakifor almost 1/10th the retail price of this one, seriously.",0
I purchased this for my daughters baby shower. She uses it a lot and has it in the nursery. She has a frog theme.,1
I bought this monitor as a gift.  My Nephew and his wife have a newborn and go camping.  They were looking for a battery operated monitor for when the baby was napping and couldn't find one locally.  This one does the trick.  It is also compact so they are able to keep it in the diaper bag for when they are not at home.,1
The suction cups don't always stay on--you have to press very hard and even then sometimes one of them will fall. But I like how you can collect all the bath toys in one place and let them drain while being able to see what you're looking for.,0
"Very cute and sturdy lamp perfect for any girls room or nursery.  The only critism I have is that while unpacking the lamp shade was easily bent, which can leave creases.",1
My daughter loves this thing.  She started using it around 3.5 months and is 6 months now.  365 degrees of jumping entertainment.  I owe my semi-clean house to this wonderful gift!,1
"Everyone I know told me I had to get this pillow, especially if I was going to try nursing. I even brought it to the hospital. This pillow is way bigger and bulkier than I expected it to be. It was awkward to use and I hated every minute of trying to make it work to nurse my little one. I ended up not using it at all and am now stuck with a huge pillow and several sheets.  Hopefully my son can use it to practice sitting up, if not, then this was a complete waste of my money. It's just not all it's cracked up to be.",0
I never knew these existed so when I found them I was very happy now no longer getting bruises ever time I walk past a bed in the guest room,1
This is in an apartment bedroom and it does the trick.  Never an issue with smell and you just shove the little diaper into the genie.  I don't know how people make it without this.  Great to use and keeps you from running to the trash after each change or two!  Not too expensive so this would also make a nice shower gift.  This does the trick so no need to really pay for the higher fancier model.,1
"I FIRST GOT THIS OUT FOR MY SON AT 4 WKS AND HE SEEMED DISINTERESTED. I BROUGHT IT OUT AGAIN A FEW WEEKS LATER AND HE SEEMED MUCH MORE INTERESTED. AT FIRST HE JUST STARED AT THE BIRD, THEN HE STARTED GRABBING AND KICKING AT THE HANGING TOYS. HE LAUGHS AND SMILES AND HAS LOTS OF FUN. THERE ARE TWO SMALL PROBLEMS I HAVE WITH THIS TOY:1)IT SEEMS LIKE THE TOYS THAT HANG ON THE LOOPS EITHER HANG TOO LOW OR TOO HIGH. I HAD TO ADJUST THE TOYS TO MAKE TYHEM THE RIGHT HEIGHT. 2) AFTER A WEEK, THE BIRDS HEAD CAME OFF. IT REATTACHED EASILY, BUT IT FALLS OFF EASILY TOO.",1
"The idea of this set is nice, but the toothbrush bristles are not quite soft enough for baby's teeth/gums and a little large for baby's mouth, and the gum stimulator (which is the main reason I got this set for my teething baby) is a bit too big for my baby's mouth too, and he gags on it pretty easily. The finger brush is good - the same as any other. However, none of the products are BPA-Free, and they're all made in China, which is always a red flag for me these days; especially for something that I'm putting in my baby's mouth. If you're looking for a good gum stimulator/massager, I suggest the other one we got which fits my baby's mouth much nicer, is BPA-Free and is offered with free shipping by Giggle: [...] (Called Gum Massager Brush (BPA-Free).) You're likely better off getting a baby toothbrush and/or finger brush at your local grocery store.",0
My wife requested this bag and she appears satisfied. It is very portable. Has a nice assortment of pockets/storage areas.,1
I agree with all of the reviews here.  I also use mine to sterilize my Medela Pump in Style breast pump parts too.  I tried this once on the stove and it was a pain compared to using the Avent Express Microwave Steam Sterilizer.,1
"This bracelet is absolutely beautiful. My baby boy just started teething and has been pretty uncomfortable. I'd read a lot about different ways to ease his discomfort and decided to try the amber jewelry before giving him medication. This bracelet is beautiful and it fits my little man perfectly. I can see it fitting him for a while, which is important because he's still quite small. Most importantly, the beads on the bracelet seem sturdy, which is obviously very important when dealing with babies. I wouldn't put anything on my baby if I though that it wasn't safe, and I definitely feel that this bracelet is strong enough to withstand a little tugging from my baby. I highly recommend these products if you're looking for something cute to help with teething pain.",1
"I had a Moby-type wrap with my daughter that worked well until she was over a year old, but my boys have weighed more and gained weight faster from the beginning. My youngest is now 10 months old and I was getting head and backaches carrying him around in the Moby-type wrap. We were planning a trip to Disney World, so I had to find something that would work. Someone gave me a baby Bjorn for free. I think that was even more painful than the Moby-type wrap, so I was a little nervous at how this would be since I was spending quite a bit of money on it. I LOVE it. It was worth every penny!! I carried my son around theme parks and airports for 5 days without backaches or headaches. The weight is mainly put on my hips, so I don't even feel it. He slept well in it. I love the head cover for when he would fall asleep or when the sun was hot. I also love the pouch on it. It was a great place to carry ID, my phone, money or gift cards. Whoever designed this is a genius, and I am so thankful I bought it.",1
"its really useful. I have it connected to my changing pad. I use it a lot since we are a family who take tons of road trips, and smelly diapers don't 'perfume' the whole car :))",1
Not what I expected very disappointed!!!  I would not have wasted my time on this had I known this was what it was going to be.,0
"This bra is a complete dream for those of us who have a ton of things to do and still have to pump. It is comfortable and very easy and fast to set up. Adjusting it to fit my size was a snap. It holds the bottles in place very securely even when raisng my arms up and down while doing my hair or putting on makeup in the mornings.  Unlike the bra clips that came with my pump, nothing has ever come apart or fallen/spilled when using my new bra.  I cant believe I didnt order one of these sooner. It is worth every penny!",1
"I'm a first time mom of a wonderful baby girl. We travel alot to visit our families 2 hours away in another city and now that baby girl is sitting up and taking solids we needed something for when we visit family. This booster seat is great! It was a life saver over the holidays! I was able to safely secure it to chairs at the grandparents houses for lunch and dinner feedings. My baby was pretty comfortable in it (as comfortable as a restrained little one who wants to crawl around can be!). It felt secure and I did not worry about her sitting in it. That being said I would not recommend leaving your baby unattended in it as chairs can tip over. However, I rate it 5 stars! It folds up very nicely and compact for travel. This is a great product!",1
My snoogle pillow is difficult to clean so this cover made it much easier.  I don't like that this item had to be purchased separately from the pillow.  It should just come with it.  Like the jersey knot- so soft!,1
I doubt I can add anything that hasn't already been said about Sophie!  She is a must-have for all babies!  This was one of the first toys we gave to our daughter and she has loved it ever since!  We thought we lost Sophie and my husband ordered another one right away!  Well worth the money!,1
Got these for twin granddaughters!  So sweet and soft.  I know my girls will love these loveys. I am having them monogrammed for Christmas.,1
I had some trepidation about this stroller because of the comment about the small basket. Yes it is smaller than a Graco travel system but what isn't. It is still a reasonable size that our diaper bag fits in. The action on the wheels is smooth and the turns are tight. Also the recline is easier that any of the strollers I saw in a brick'n'mortar store.,1
"Great addition to the Deuter Kids backpack. Keeps the sun out of my little one's face while going on hikes etc.I was surprised to find an additional rain cover in the pocket. Great bonus item. Haven't had to use it yet, but it's nice to know I can now keep the rain out as well.",1
"Easy to put together and, my son just loves it! He loves bouncing in it while I'm doing laundry. Great buy",1
"We bought this SpongeBob tether backpack for our 2year old daughter to take to Disneyland when she wouldn't allow us to put on the plush dog tether previously purchased.  When the backpack arrived I was so pleased with the size, look and feel.  My daughter took one look at it and asked to have ""budgebob"" put on her back.  She wore it around for two weeks before leaving on the trip, and the entire three days at Disneyland.  She especially loved that SpongeBob held her favorite snacks and treats for her.  Really happy with this purchase!",1
"I had to sell this stroller after one use because I kicked the wheels probably a dozen times.  Very VERY disappointing because I love the color and style!  I'm only 5'6""  so if you're a petite person and not planning on any tall people using it then it may work out just fine for you.  Or I suppose if you are a ""baby steps"" type of walker, but I take long strides.  Wish the handles were adjustable- they needed to be an extra 3-4 inches higher.",0
"We purchased this product for our 3.5 year old sone, who finally graduated from the potty to the big people toilet. I'm extremely happy that we purchased this product. This seat was our second try, the first seat we purchased had to go back to the store due to the fact that the splash guard instead of preventing the pee to go all over the place, was actually catapulting it across the room when my little boy wasn't aiming. When he was, due to the spash guard being too small and our son sitting too high on that seat, we ended up having pee running down the front of the toilet. After a week of the potty adventures while I looked at different options available on line and at the stores I gave this seat a try. I was not disappointed in the least. The splash guard works great, it's not huge and younger boys might have difficulty aiming, but I believe it's the best option available for those of us who have boys. It's extremely easy to use, we have been able to take it with us when we visit friends and family and we have not come across a toilet that this seet would not fit on. It's very easy to clean. The plastic is very smooth, so there are no issues with scratching. The only gripe I do have is that sometimes my son complains that his bum get's tired of sitting on the hard surface. But on the other hand, it'll ensure that he will not sit indefinitely on the toilet reading his books :)",1
"I run a children's consignment shop and this is the most popular potty to buy/sell second-hand. That said, there are two design flaws that I'd love to see fixed: One, when a boy pees standing up into this potty and hits the splash guard in the back, the urine runs into the cracks between the blue and white pieces and onto the floor. Why not make it so that the potty seat somehow slips *under* the blue spash guard so that the inevitable misfires are directed to the right place?  Second, the bottom of the potty consists of two edges with a void inbetween -- if the bottom edge were instead solid, it would prevent liquid from getting up in that void, and cleaning would be easier.",0
"As other reviewers have noted, the filter sits in a shallow tray of water. Well it's nearly impossible to take out that tray without water spilling all over. And I've had a few instances where the tank isn't seated exactly right and all the water leaks out. It is also quite noisy, good for white noise effects but annoying with a baby monitor since it masks the sounds of baby.",0
"I was about to lose my mind this winter with my 5 year old son bouncing off the walls because it was too cold to go outside and run and play.  I bought this item right around christmas and he has been using it for about 6 weeks now.  The only issue we had with it is that he uses it so much that it started to squeek, but a little wd40 fixed that.  Now when he is going crazy I tell him to show me how fast he can go and he jumps on it a runs like the wind ( and I don't have to worry about his head hitting a counter top).  He is 5 but on the small side (still wearing a 4t) and it is plenty big for him to fit on for at least two more years.",1
"I got a new wedding ring because I lost the one my wife gave meat our wedding.  Since gold is expensive and I lost a gold one, I decided that titanium would be a good substitute; however, I take a size 8 or 8 1/2 but found only a size 9.  This ring sizer worked very well.",1
I read the reviews but still wanted to see for myself and I had no problems at all. I set it up in 2 minutes at most with no directions.. Mine works great.. It's the exact same as the original summer infant best view we purchased 6 months ago... So I have to give it a thumbs up because of how easy it is to use and set up..Now we can switch back and forth from our babies room and the big playroom. Love it!,1
Beans bags are costly....not sure why but they also run small....hard to gage size from pictures. Kids love them though!,0
"Long range, good sensitivity. We had recommend it to several friends. One of the best baby monitors out there, battery life not so impresive.",1
Zoo baby is a good product but the only problem is with the speed of the swing . The speed of the swing is the same in every stage of 1 to 7 .,1
We have several different brands but My 3 month old baby loves these best. Soft and easy to clean .,1
I bought this for my son to use in the car.  It's fine except the front needs some kind of closure or else the sides just open up and down goes the head.  I sewed on a ring and a hook to keep it closed.,1
Though it didn't match my aunt's son nursery it kept his attention for longer than the other mobile that went with his bedding called moonbeam mobile. He loves it!,1
"I recently bought this seat for my 6 month old son.  I was really looking for something where I could bath both my kids at the same time (my daughter is 22 months).  Anything to save time.  Well this seat is perfect.  Now that he can sit up well, I can put them both in the tub and put enough water in there for my daughter to have fun playing around.  He loves the bath so much more beucase he too can splash,  play, and see everything that is going on.  I read a few reviews and there was some negativily about the when you pull the kids out of the seat they may get some red marks on the top of thier theighs, and that has happened.  But they are mostly just from movign around and the marks go away right after you take them out.  Just as long as you  pull them out carefully you will not hurt them.  I higly recommend this seat.",1
"We love this tub- we transitioned her as soon as she could sit up on her own.  I agree with some other reviews that it's a little wide in some spots, making it a bit difficult to squeeze into a narrower tub, but it really hasn't been a big issue- just deflate it a bit. We don't worry if she tips over, as she'll just hit the inflatable padding.  And, it's nice and big, which is especially fantastic now that she's 13+ months and looooves to thrash and splash around during bath time.We spray it down after every bath and use the suction cup to hang it on the wall; the suction works amazingly well and the tub never falls off the wall.  We have never had issues with slime or mildew build-up, as it's plastic and you can easily wash it.  If you leave it in the tub forever without picking it up and rinsing the bottom...well...it's going to get gross.",1
"my favorite sippy cup for a baby of all. easy to clean, not too many parts, etc. Great just for water. handy. doesn't leak.",1
"Bought this as a top-of-the-stairs gate since no other gate seems to work with the strange construction of our townhome. The price initially ran me off, but after trying several others we knuckled down and bought it.First off, the directions are terrible, but manageable. They tell you just enough to get the gate on. I liked that you had the option to either stick the wall cups onto the wall or use the screws. In a rental that's one less thing to worry about. I had to add an extension, and the fact that they have so many options to get you to the correct width is a lifesaver. However, they don't really explain how to add on the extensions. It was easy enough to figure out, but come on. The installation manual should explain everything.Once the gate is up it's sturdy, and you're not going to want to move it any time soon. I like that at the bottom hinge there's a little plastic piece that you can use to change what direction the gate swings or to make it stand open. Again, I wish they'd explain that better in the instruction manual. I discovered it accidentally, but it makes a big difference if you're hauling groceries and a car seat up the stairs.It's somewhat of a pain to open, but I'll count that as a good thing because my child seems to be very good at mcgyvering already, and I'm glad this will take a while to figure out. Overall, we like it and have ordered another one as our baby is exploring further...",1
"This is a great toy for 4mo+, my daughter loved to watch it dance and thought it was so funny. She learned how to push the button and would push it over and over. The colors are fun and stimulating for little ones, it is also easy for them grab. It goes through batteries pretty quickly but that is because my daughter loved this toy.",1
"We're big fans of OXO products in general. This booster chair has worked great for our 35""-2yo  (and 28.5"" high dining table) and despite what some reviewers have said about durability, ours looks good as new 4 months in. We love it! And so does the kiddo. She climbs up and onto it by herself and it's light enough for her to move and place as she likes.The design is streamlined which makes for easy disassembling, cleaning, folding and carrying. Love the fun, modern, unisex colors too! It's so portable and lightweight, we like to bring it with us when we go out to eat, as our kid can't stand the highchairs most restaurants use and it's much more secure than the average restaurant booster seat because of the rubberized perimeter on the bottom.I was initially concerned that there were no safety straps, but based on how our kid behaved in her previous seat with belts, we didn't feel it would be an issue, and it wasn't. Whether it works for your kid, I think, is a judgment call for parents to make about their own kid's abilities/behavior at the table.Note: Not sure why the price jumped up so much(?) From $26 (when we bought it) to $40",1
"We looked at many high chairs and finally settled for this feeding chair. My 9 months daughter really loves having her meals sitting on it. Also it has made my wife's life easy. It's easy to clean, can place it on the floor or tie to a chair. Infact we also take it along with us to restaurants. We highly recommend this. Not expensive and looks good.",1
"Gone through 3 brushes in less than a month. The first 2 the nipple brush broke in less than 2 weeks, this time the bottle brush broke off the handle after the 2nd use! I wash about 5 bottles a day... Definitely going to switch brands this time.",0
"As a single mom and hearing all the horrible stories of SIDS, I decided I needed this device. Personally, I feel it gave me some peace of mind to know this device would activate and alert me if baby as not breathing. I know nothing is 100% percent, but it sure helped me.",1
"Great product. No tears during the bath time anymore. My 3 year old help me to hold it, then I can rinsing her hair. So far we donot have any problems. She is very happen with her 'bath hat'.",1
"This is a really great bib--easy to clean, perfect for wet foods like yogurt and applesauce, a large pocket, etc.  The only problem is that it's quite awkward to use with a high chair.  The bib is long enough that it interferes with the high chair tray. The bib sticks out (where the pocket is) since it's a hard material, so I can't push in my daughter's high chair tray very far.  That makes it more difficult for her to reach food on her tray, and unfortunately more food ends up on her lap.  If the high chair issue doesn't bother you, then this is a great bib.  My daughter likes it and doesn't seem to be bothered by the rubber piece around the neck.",0
"My husband and I are expecting twins (a boy & a girl) and couldn't decide what we wanted to do with the nursery since they will be sharing a room.  We came across this set by Wendy Bellissimo and knew it would be perfect for our boy & girl room.  We purchased 2 of these cribs sets on-line and just received them and am thrilled!!  The fabrics are so soft, especially the blanket.  I really like all the accessories that are available to coordinate the rest of the room as well.  I give this crib set 5 stars!",1
"I ordered this from Amazon's Vine program near Christmas time. I decided to give it to my 15 month-old grandson for a gift.Granted, this toy was up against a dozen other presents all opened at the same time.I gave this one 3 stars because it did get play time over most of the other toys.  I didn't give it 5-stars because, even though he was within the recommended age range specified by the manufacturer, he was unable to push hard enough to make it go any distance.He did end up throwing it and then chasing it, which we had to put a halt to as there were other children around....so, he liked it...just not the way it was supposed to be liked...",0
"Gate came fast, easy to install, very sturdy.  The door stays open and opens easily with one hand.9 month old, 6.5 lbs cat can fit through all the bars, even the small ones.  We ended up propping up the cardboard that the gate came in on the one side so that he couldn't get through.  He has made no attempt to jump over.  Once he grows a bit it should work well.",1
It really works wonderfully as a shade. I thought it was the best one on the market and i searched long and hard. The only con is that it is being held in place with double sided sticky tape at the bottom of both ends. The tape wears off after a while and the corners tend to pull up. She is still able to sit comfortably in the shade but  rhe bottom rides up.,0
"This system is pretty awesome. The only reason why I selected 4 stars instead of 5 stars is for 2 reasons. One is that the car seat gets pretty hot with the infant padding. Since my son is pretty small... I need the padding in order to keep him sitting in the seat correctly. The second reason is that the stroller is pretty darn big even when folding it up. Other than those two things, the set is very nice looking, works well and easy to use. I would purchase again for sure.",1
Wow is this item the pits and a waste of money. It's like a pillow not a mattress. My 14 lb baby sank right in the middle rendering it useless. I tried the Carter's velour cover and it was way to small. Fits the pack and play but what a piece of crap. The plastic cover over the foam/pillow whatever it is also way to big for what's inside. Bad manufacturing from start to finish. Save yourself the hassle and put a thick quilt on top of what comes in pack and play and that works much better and feels more like mattress the baby uses when at home.,0
"One can't have enough washcloths, most of the pack that i've seen were either 6 pack or 10.  I think 12 is perfect.",1
I purchased these for my sister's kids because I thought that they sounded good.  I don't know too much about baby bottles but I didn't hear any complaints about them from my sister...,1
really glad we got this. The bath toys are no longer all underfoot. Our kiddo even liked putting his toys in the net when he is done. I am glad I read some reviews because I did need to do the trick where you wipe the suction cups and the wall with alcohol before sticking them. Since I have done that they have not fallen off at all.,1
They are done.in bright bold colors. They are not too small for infants to play with. They make my 5 month old grandson laugh.,1
There is a hard plastic board on the back of the seat padding which is not safe for children who like to rest their heads on it. My baby had a cut on the back of her head when she turned from one direction to another. The plastic board is sharp enough to cut the skin as the fabric of the seat padding is thin.,0
Love this product!  It keeps my baby so warm.  It's not very long though so I think it's best for babies up to about 6-7 months old.,1
"The baby was about 10 months old when we got them, and we've had them for about 4 months now.  She has fun looking at and poking the characters.  They're easy to fill using a wide-tip funnel and a tall cup to stand the pouch in.  They are easy to wash with a bottle brush, and I've never had one leak or burst open.  The zipper closure has become a harder to close over time, but I'm fine with that because it's VERY secure.  My only complaint is that the pouches are a bit floppy; they don't stand up in the baby's hands the way the disposable store-bought ones do.  It makes it harder for the bottom half of the food to be sucked in, especially since the baby doesn't like the pouch to be held while she's eating from it and won't leave it rolled or folded up to keep the food closer to the tip.  I'm pretty sure she will learn to squish the food to where it needs to be as she gets older.",1
THIS THING IS BIG AND BULKY AND SLIPPERY WHEN WET. BEST ONE IS Summer Infant Mother's Touch Large Comfort Bather,0
Very cute and soft. Good value with 2 towels and 2 wash cloths. Seems to be made well. This is a gift so they haven't been used as of yet.,1
This gift for our kids met all my expectations and our kids'. The booster is perfect for any chair that has a fairly large base. The legs are easy to carry and install anywhere so you don't even need to use it as a booster unless you want to. The contemporary owl fabric delighted my daughter-in-law. Great value great product.,1
"The """"Bongo Bag"""" is a very nice clothing storage/hamper that folds flat when not in use. We use these in our kids rooms for their laundry.A good product that works like it should. Recommended!",1
"I love this bag.  I love that I get a lot of comments while using it.  It seems to have the perfect amount of space for day trips, and the right amount of pockets to carry all the little things.  I have 4 kids, two of them in diapers and take this everywhere.I would give it 5 stars, except the straps feel thin and I wonder how the bag will hold up over time when I tend have a lot of stuff inside of it.  I will update in a few months when I know how they hold up.  I have been using for 2 months now!",1
"The playmat is quite thick and definitely pads the edges so the kids won't get hurt and covers the table so it doesn't get scratched up. The pattern is a fun zoo pattern with a nice neutral tan color on the flip side. The only downside to us is that it's a little bulky. You can't sit a cup or anything like that on it. But it works well to protect the table and give the kids a place to play. Overall, pretty great for protecting nice furniture and the kids.",1
"I'm not sure this is something that is necessary for everyoneWe have regular drying rack that is clean so we can use that at home. If you need a rack at work or somewhere else in the house then maybe this can be useful.I find it funny that &#34;flexible design&#34; just means how many arms you want to attach to the base. They can only go in one way. You decide how many you want to attached. I guess &#34;flexible design&#34; is marketspeak for &#34;assembly required&#34;?I do like the design, if you load it up like the pictures on the box, the bottles, nipples, rings, etc will all get dry. My my regular drying rack will work too.",0
"This pillow was very supportive to my baby belly and my back.  My husband was worried I would keep using it after our daughter was born, and I was tempted!  Will use again for 2nd pregnancy!",1
I love this bag so much!! It is sturdy and the material its made of is easy to clean with a wet wash cloth. I received exactly what I was expecting from the picture. Highly recommended!!,1
"This is awesome! I love that there are the dangling toys to engage the hands and the keyboard to engage the feet. This is well made and extremely fun for baby. Each kick of the keyboard is followed by a proud, gleeful cry. I couldn't be happier with this product; I would absolutely recommend it. A great baby shower gift.",1
I liked the mobile but i wish it was just a tad less expensive. It still goes great with the other all star products,1
"These worked at first, but the more my daughter stuck her hand in, the easier the snacks could be shaken out.  She is 18 months and also figured out quite quickly how to open the top flaps to get more out.  Not quite the product I anticiapted it being. May be better for larger snack items like animal crackers, but a disaster with cheerios.",0
This couldn't be cuter and the music plays clearly.  It is a nice toy for one of those little creatures in your life.,1
This is such a sweet looking tree and flowers .  And it really is quite tall.  I really liked that it came with a diagram to show how to put the leaves on the tree.  It was very easy to get on the wall.,1
I loved this baby toy and would recommend it to anyone who is attending a baby shower - it was a big hit,1
"We've had this for a few months now and already had to order two replacement toys. The spinners no longer make sounds and my daughter can pull the book right off. This is described as ""rocking,"" but that means an active child (like my 8-month-old) can rock it right off its stand. She can't tip it over, but she can move it all over the place.That said, she does love playing in it for about 20 minute stretches. She especially loves the animal sound/ music box. She enjoys being able to move herself around and rediscovering each new toy. Standing up in it has made her legs and upper body stronger, too.The concept of these activity centers/ ""exersaucers"" is great, but they need to have extremely sturdy construction. This one doesn't have it.",0
"Pros: Fits great in compact cars (like my VW Jetta), comfortable, easy to put together.Cons: The back to the booster seat doesnt snap in well. So if its moved even just a little bit it falls apart.Over all my son loves it and is comfortable in it. So I love it too.",1
"And bought two small bags, one for my baby, she is Leo the lion, but a time to buy is sold out. A pity. Another gift to your friends. Her baby is like.",1
My girls love their new hampers and they can easily bring them downstairs which helps me.  I'm considering getting a few more for the beach house.,1
"It has been many years since we needed diaper pins, but I do like to pin my socks together through the wash and have never lost one yet. I was using brass dressmaker pins but they tended to open up during the wash cycle. My wife suggested diaper pins and we tried them. Thery're working perfectly and staying together through the washing. Matter of fact they can get a little tricky to open, but of course that was the idea. Recommended to keep your socks &#34;friended up&#34;.",1
"UPDATE:I wanted to update anyone who reads these reviews on my contact with the company.  This is the most customer-centric company I've ever dealt with.  After reading my review, which as you can see below was not a negative review, necessarily; the company contacted me to try and resolve my issues.  Let me tell you, I 100% recommend this seller and their products.  They sent me a replacement unit to try and solve my slight issue with the day-to-night camera sensitivity problem.  With the decline of customer service now-a-days, it was refreshing to have the company try so hard to make me happy.Replaced my older camera.  Not perfect, but I'd still recommend it.  Here are a few things I've noticed:One of the cameras has trouble showing an image during the day, going from the night to day switch.  The fix is to cover the sensor on the camera until with your hand until it goes into night mode (even though it's during the day...room is dark).Sound is not very clear when baby is crying, but not a big deal since it works great when it's quiet.Using the multiple camera setting where it goes from one camera to the other automatically leaves the monitor screen on, even if you manually turn it off.  Wish it had a feature where it would go to the camera that had a noise/movement automatically.The 2-way system is decent.  Not the clearest sound, but it works as a cheap intercom.No belt clip on the monitor",1
The infant part of the ergo is slightly awkward to get used to and positioning your baby can be difficult at first but overall my baby loves being in it and appears comfortable once settled.,1
"So I am waaaaay too old to have a nightlight, but I have a very, very dark bedroom and enjoy having something interesting to look at as I fall asleep.  Enter: Twilight Turtle.  Man, this little guy is plush enough to cuddle in bed, and bright enough to illuminate my entire 20'x13' bedroom.  He has three settings; blue, green and yellow.  I personally usually leave him on yellow, but occasionally set him for blue.  And I swich it by just pressing one of the three easy to feel buttons near his bottom, at the backside of his shell.  He stays automatyically lit for a good 45 minutes before shutting himself off.  He came with batteries, and I've been using him every night for about 2 weeks on those and he's still going strong.  I love Him!",1
My 2 year old daughter loved this baby bed from the moment she saw it on Christmas morning.  She carries it around the house and can put her baby to sleep anywhere she wants.  I love that it is so flexible and mobile.  Great Quality!,1
"I really like this bunny, I think I like it more than my 4 mo. old daughter whom I originally bought it for. She seems to prefer the spit rag over any other soft toy I try to give her. Maybe she will grow to like this bunny more as time goes on. The ends and ears seem very chew-able, maybe as teething sets in she'll take to chewing on it because it is nice and soft. I always put it next to her at nap time and when she goes to bed, and before I gave it to her I slept with a few nights so that it smelled like mom. The bunny also has a very friendly face and long ears, and the sage color is very gentle.***2 years later***This bunny became my child's go-to sleep lovey. We eventually fazed it out as she had too many things in bed with her and would get really upset in the middle of the night if one of them couldn't be immediately located, but I am STILL really pleased with this little bunny. He has survived a lot, and been washed many times, and still looks good. A quality product!",1
"I bought this for my grandson, to entertain him in the car.  He loves it. I like the selection of music.",1
"This is the best purchase that I made for me and my child.  I used The Original baby Sling with my first child and was highly displeased with it.  However, the Moby Wrap is amazing.  I am able to actually get chores done and it is super convient for shopping.  To top it off if my baby is fussy and nothing else soothes her, I just pop her in Moby in the hug hold and she goes right to sleep.",1
"This is the best quality star projection light I can find.  I bought a smaller, cheaper, piece of junk that cost about eight dollars that worked great for a week then broke.  I have searched high and low for a replacement.  This one projects beautiful stars onto the ceiling in either an orangish, blue, green or color changing glow.  It does not rotate or play music which I did not need anyway, but it does have a handy forty-five minute timer that shuts off the stars.  It is built well and will not easily fall apart like the last one did if you needed to move it or bring it along while traveling.  My daughter loves The Little Prince and was SO EXCITED when she saw this light and squealed when it lit stars on her ceiling.The only thing I am not sure about is the on/off switch is actually a touch sensor and not a switch at all.  It allows you to cycle through the four settings - orange, blue, green, all the colors or off.  The LEDs are nice and bright and the fact that it runs on batteries lets you have the freedom to place the light anywhere in the room.  I am very pleased with my purchase.",1
These are amazing.  We love our &#34;glow babies&#34;.  So neat.  And they can have them in bed with them at night.,1
"Love this potty. We're still working on potty training but this potty has been a god send! No fancy music or lights to get the child distracted ot make it a ""toy"" and only 2 peices! It's very light ans easy to clean. My daughter (22 mths) has no problem climbing on by herself and the handles help to make her feel secure. Great Potty, why spend the extra money when this one works great!",1
"My daughter's got 4 wubbanubs so far. there is definitely a different pacifier that came with this one though. It is not even a week older than her wubbanub pink puppy, yet the pacifier seems to be made of a tougher silicone. Not that she cares. She does seem to love chewing on this more than she does sucking on it.",1
"The Biddy Belly is perfect for tummy time. My daughter used to cry the second I put her down on her stomach, with biddy belly, she actually likes tummy time!",1
Have all of the cotton tale girly collection but the mobile wouldn't adjust to our crib.  I had to send it back.,0
"We bought this stroller because it got excellent reviews, we like britax products (had the b-nimble stroller and b-safe car seat), and it can expand to fit another child. We've been using it for a few months now and compared to the nimble it's great, but has a few drawbacks.Pros:- Flexible configuration. The seat can be facing toward or away from the parent. We like our son to face us so this is a feature we love.- Smooth ride. The wheels are very sturdy and it rides as though it's a jogging stroller. We've actually gone jogging with it a few times and it was great. It's also smooth over different types of terrain (grass, rocks, concrete, asphalt, etc,)- Large canopy. Provides ample shade for our baby.- Large underseat storage. We can fit 2 diaper bags and more!- Self standing when folded.Cons:- Heavy! You'll get a great work out putting this in/out of your trunk.- Bulky. We have an SUV and this pretty much takes up the entire trunk. The wide base of the back wheels also make it difficult to navigate certain stores (like Gymboree.)",1

"I've used 900 of these bags, and constantly worry when I defrost one, that it will leak.  (most of these I've donated to the milk bank, but I've kept about 100). I've had 1 out of every 5 leak on defrosting.  I store my milk in these during the day at work, and in 3 months, at least 10 times I've come home to a little cooler full of leaked milk.  In theory the bags are great b/c of the environmental aspect, but honestly, as a mom, the structure of the bag is more important!  I'm tired of losing my ""liquid gold"" 6 ounces at a time!",0
"Really happy with this item.  Was looking for an inflatable tub to replace another one.  My 18 month old is huge, so I wanted a big tub to give him some room.  After looking a ton, selected this one and its great.  Bigger than the Disney Cars one I had previously.Great find!",1
"I'm going mad trying to find out how tall this gate actually is!  Why would a company advertise a product as extra tall and NEVER (unless I've already lost it) tell a consumer the actual height?  I've looked at a dozen websites, as well as The First Year's own website.  Nothing.  Zip.  Ziltch.  No mention of the height.  I'm also surprised to see no reviewers happened to mention the height.Can anyone help me out?",0
Oh thank god! A solution to the 30 seconds of utter monotony 2 year olds face while they pee... Phew!,1
"I can't complain, these things have saved us so many sleepless nights because of a gassy baby! My first child had a major problem with gas because of the formula he was on, we tried so many different bottles and systems until we came across these. What a lifesaver! The Dr. Brown's bottles do a great job at keeping gas out of baby's stomach but these liners do an even better job! I must say though that I do miss the old design and the expandable liners, I don't know why they changed it but the new design still gets the job done. Now, with our second child these liners are still trumping any bottle feeding system out there. Don't buy the cheaper store brands if you really want your baby gas free, we have tried that and there's a huge difference in them! Will definitely be using these again if we have a 3rd!",1

"Tie-dye one-size pocket diapers? And made in the USA? Finally! ButterBears makes their tie-dye pocket diapers with a layer of PUL inside. This means that the diaper is really water-tight, no chance of delamination, and the exterior of the diaper is nice and soft and holds its rich colors.When I got it my diaper, I was pleased to see that it had a large amount of snaps, so that one could get a pretty good custom fit. The lining is suedecloth, the tie-dye colors were really rich. The diaper runs a bit bigger than my other one-size pockets which I like because I want this diaper to fit until potty learning (my daughter was 19 months when I got this diaper). However with so many snaps, one could easily snap this down and have it fit a baby of just a few months old. It came out of the wash and dryer looking exactly as it did when I received it - great condition, colors rich and true.I put the diaper on my daughter around 9am, she was still wearing it when she went down for her nap around 11:30. She slept for almost three hours, and is known to be a tosser and a turner. When she woke, she was happy, her skin was happy, and best of all... her crib was dry. Can't think of any better test of a diaper than having it be worn for over five hours after consuming a whole sippy cup of water and completing two nursings!Do know, I didn't receive an insert with my diaper (special deal) - I used it with a microfiber insert from another brand.  The pocket of this diaper can accommodate most brand-name inserts - it has a wide opening making it easy to fit you entire hand in to lay inserts flat, and also has enough room for some major stuffing for nighttime wear.  I have used this diaper overnight with two hemp and one microfiber insert and it has done great.I have now had this diaper for a few months (my daughter is now 24 months) and this diaper is still as reliable as it was when purchased, and the colors still rich and true.  I wash it with Rockin' Green and have put it in a hot dryer for 80% of the washes.  Really impressed with how it has held up!",1
love these cooler packs for my kids lunches. They stay cold a long time and are much more durable than they appear. Still going strong after a full yr of use at school. Highly.recommend!,1
We live in Japan and it is quite windy which makes the winters that much colder. I felt horrible keeping our daughter all bundled up to the point she could not wee what was going on and believe  me she let us know she didn't like it either!!! This stroller cover is durable ( it has survived 2 snow storms and a young toddler) in the last month  or so... Another great thing is that you do not need to bundle your child in it if it is not too cold we do not even put a jacket on her in there. If you have a long/tall child you may want to also purchase one of the foot /leg covers that just slip over their clothes. Our 1 year old is tall for her age and her feet stick out the bottom of the cover so we just use a blanket but are thinking of getting the extra cover before next winter.,1

"We owned an earlier model of this booster seat. I bought it about 5 years ago. It took us through 2 children. The model we had came with two removable trays. When the top tray got messy, we removed it and continued with the second tray.Because we had a high chair, it was not used constantly. It was easy to take places that didn't have high chairs such as when we visited with relatives who did not have children. You can take it on picnics or to restaurants. A few times I put it on the porch while the older child played with bubbles. The chair made the experience worry free. The children were not left alone, but it was easier to play with both children instead of having to constantly watch/pull the little back from the edge of the porch.When I gave it away recently, the plastic still looked good. To clean the straps which I could not remove, I used Shout towelette wipes. It looked almost new.I liked the colors on the older version better. The back was red with a blue seat. The trays were green and yellow.I highly recommend this booster chair.  It is light yet sturdy.  It is easy to clean and use.",1
"I have an old wooden highchair I love! However it does not have safety straps.I had  2 problems, finding a pad for the highchair and add safety straps.It seems to be the perfect solution. My son is not quite ready to use it, as he can't sit up on his own yet. I tested him in it for a short time, while supporting his head. I think it will work perfectly.I initially thought that it would be firmer with a stiffer construction, and was a little disappointed that it wasn't.Overall I am Very Happy, this solved my problem of having to buy a new highchair!",1
"Adorable little round keepsake box.  Much heavier and higher quality than I was expecting.  Perfect size for baby's 1st curl, 1st tooth, or some special little trinket.I'll be using it to place 2 heart pins and present to my child's Godparents on the morning of her baptism.  Perfect size.The only thing I was a little disappointed in was how dirty the box was that the round keepsake box came in.  I'd like to give the gift to my child's Godparents inside of the original packaging, but it's much too dirty.BUT, the most important thing is that the quality of the actual keepsake box itself is perfect.  LOVE IT!",1
"Very well made and sturdy.  Boosts my little one perfectly and it's very very easy to put her in it.  I was looking for something to replace the ""big"" seat she had and this one looked good, especially with the ability to choose a design.  The only drawback is that I had to add extra padding because it wasn't as comfortable as her ""big"" seat.  Now, with the extra pad, it's absolutely perfect!",1
"The regular pack 'n play has a fairly hard and uncomfortable bottom but with this mattress, it turns into a regular crib.  I use it for naps in the daytime and for a crib when traveling.  The mattress fits well and is lightweight.",1
"Broke within three months.  Junk, save your money.  Can't even fix it, worked great when we first got in then the frame itself broke",0
"VERY GOOD PRODUCT VERY SATIsfied, the night vision is great clarity is very good and portability is awesome plus the price is even better",0
"I've already rated the playzone itself, but I'll add it here.  If you get the Lil' Playzone you really should invest in at least one of thease extensions or you might as well use your Pack n Play.  The playzone by itself is about the same size.  Its great for a larger safe area for your child, but take those bear stickers off, they dont stick well and my child peeled one off and started eating it!",1
But I had two of them ripping on the first wash and I have another one ripping after three washes. All of them also had those little hard balls of fluff all over them but other than that they work for what they are meant for.,0
"I got this crib before my son was born, I needed a little help from my husband to put it together. I love the color and everything but what I just started to notice is I hang my diaper stacker on the side of the crib and where I do the paint has been peeling. I wish I knew this before I would of never hung it on the side.",0
loved the fact i gotton this so soon perfect gift idea if you have a little one tteething helped ease the fussiness,1
"This pillow is worth the money! In my 6 months of pregnancy, I was having sleepless nights. Trying to shift from side to side while sleeping and avoiding the back proved too hard for me! What made it worse was when I had to rearrange or shift my wedge and regular pillows each time I switched sides. With the Back 'N Belly pillow, I don't have to worry about this at all! I begin sleeping on one side and end up moving to my other side during the night with zero problems.I borrowed the idea from one of the submitted reviews. She suggested taking a pillow case, cutting off one end, and sliding it onto the Back 'N Belly. You can rest your head without worrying about getting any makeup stains or oily face stains on your pillow during naps or throughout the night. No frequent washes of the entire body pillow needed - just the pillowcase. It works!My husband and I have a king-sized bed. The pillow takes up half the bed, but it would still work with a queen-sized bed. If you are already using regular pillows for your back and sides, this body pillow is no different! In any case, you may find that your husband will want to cozy up to the pillow with you. My husband does - leaving plenty of space on the bed.I recommend this pillow to all pregnant women!",1
I have Recaro seats in my car and got this not because it matched but because I want my child to be as safe as I am.,1
"We have a chicco 30 carseat and bought this to connect to the BOB stroller. The carseat fits perfectly into this adapter and we have never had any problems with it. It has the &#34;click&#34; sound just like if you were putting it in the base. FYI, there is also a red strap that fits over the carseat as well.",1
A lot of my friends are having children and this is becoming my go-to baby shower present.  Their babies love Sophie!At stores (mostly boutiques) you'll find it for $20+.  Amazon.com has the best price!,1
Before buying a jumper we tried the jumperoo at the store...my baby hated it. It was so bulky that my baby couldn't do anything but cry. when she tried this jumper her eyes lit up and started jumping like it was second nature. She absolutely loves the toy in the front as well. She uses it when she is not jumping. I absolutely recommend this.,1
This second seat is perfect for our Phil & Teds stroller. We are constantly using it when I have my friends little one at the house.  Love it!,1
This lunch box is adorable-my little nephew loved it from the start. It's practical as we use it not only for preschool but for outings as well.,1
I bought this chair for while we were on vacation and wanted to use it to transition my daughter to eating at the dining table with us once we returned.  The problem with this hook-on high chair is we couldn't get it to hook on!  In the picture the chair is hooked up to a table that has a lip like our table.  Problem is... the chair won't fit under the lip to attach to the actual table top.  Same thing happened when we got to our vacation condo; wouldn't fit... couldn't use it.,0
"I have 9-month old twins and have tried just about every bib out there - terry, silicon, pockets, snaps, velcro, you name it.  This the only bib that truly protects my messy eaters.  The other plus is that it's the only bib that they can't pull off / chew and isn't a distraction or uncomfortable during mealtimes.  They don't even notice it.  This is the only bib we'll be using from now on.",1
I really like the idea of these however they are a little over priced in my opinion and the material seems kinda cheap looking.  The rubber beads also attracts every hair and fuzzy know to man so now exactly great to just let the little one chew on with checking and usually having to rinse off.,1
"I absolutely love this crib. It is stylish and sturdy, easy to put together. A great vintage looking crib for a great price!",1
"I've been cloth diapering for almost 3 years, and I honestly don't know how I ever did it without the Spray Pal!! My toilet and bathroom used to get so messy from diaper sprayer overspray, but this totally takes care of the problem! When you're done using it, just spray it off with your sprayer, and it folds up nice and compact, and slides right behind the toilet, out of sight. I recommend it to any mom I know who uses cloth diapers, or is considering cloth diapering. And I love that buying it supports a small business, and real family, not just some big corporation. Best $20 I've spent for cloth diapering!",1
Great for little girls. My daughter loved it... until she grew from it.Looks so adorable on 2 - 4 year olds.,1
"These are awesome!  Big enough to wrap baby up tight and lightweight enough to not worry about smothering said baby.  We live in NorCal and it's cool here in the summer.  Great for summer and winter in CA though.  Cute designs (and their matching bibs are pretty fantastic, too).",1
"This is the lowest rating I've ever given a product.  The nipples are ONLY made for the lids for the 8oz cups.  It's not mentioned ANYWHERE and people are ending up with useless products.  Why did Nuby make them different in the first place????Annoying.Update... A woman called a long while ago asking me to upgrade my review if they changed the product listing. I just browsed it and it has changed, but I MUST warn others.  Look very VERY VEEEERY closely at the nipple you wish to replace and compare them EXTREMELY closely to the images provided ESPECIALLY of the ones that show the shape of the ""hour-glass"" platform that the nipple sits atop.  Some sippy cups have a symmetrical hour-glass,  this one is asymmetrical with a smaller lobe and larger lobe.  This is CRUCIAL in whether it will fit your existing sippy cup.THIS IS MY WARNING TO YOU.My low rating stands because the product simply wasn't accurately portrayed when I purchased it and it should stand as a warning to others.",0
The actual potty part is very small but overall I am pleased with this product. My daughter loves the flushing sound. Now if I could just get her to use it! LOL,1
"I bought this bag for my daughter to use on her full size stroller. It's fantastic.  It has a very strechy elastic top and the bag it's self is very strechy allowing you to get tons into it.  We often have two large heavy purses in it and the top snap closes it up for extra security. When we don't have purses in it, it's great for an extra blanket, snacks, toys, or small packages.  We also have the ""mommy hook"" and it's great for large bags and for purses when the Prince Lionhart bag is full of baby things.  Between the two there is just about nothing you can't carry safely and securely on the stroller.  We love it.",1
Pampers airwave bottels are  a great product. They're the only bottle my grandson will drink from. Thank you so much!,1
Very bright and colorful so small children can really appreciate the graphics.  It lost one star because the sheets seem a little too silky and will add to the slipping out of bed factor.  I would not suggest it for to young of a toddler.  I just purchased this so I do not know how it will hold up to washings.  Stay tuned for a follow-up in maybe 6 to 8 months.,1
I bought this as a gift for Christmas.  The only problem I have is that the bag is not all that big.  But it is a quality bag; heavy fabric.,1
This product has been my right hand ever since we bought it. It has been a soothing toy that helps me keep the baby busy while I get some much needed sleep or get stuff done around the house. I HIGHLY recomend this toy to busy parents that need a help getting there baby to sleep or just need a few minutes to themselves. A piece of advice do not put the baby in the rocker to much cause babies have the tendency of getting bored fast. Making them stay in it constatly will just make them not like the toy. All in All one of the best baby buys yet!!!,1
"I bought this to put in my simplicity bassinet that I purchased in 2005 for my first baby, so the original mattress (which was not that good to start out with) had seen far better days. Anyhow, this size fits perfectly and it is way thicker and plusher than the mattress I've been using. Now I won't feel as if I'm laying my baby to bed on a piece of covered pressed board!",1
"My son doesn't have an interest in trying to stick his finger into the socket but he certainly likes to pull plugs. I was spending half of the day trying to keep him away from all of the outlets. These outlet covers have solved the problem. I can get to things if need be but he can't. They are easy to put on and remove with a minimum of fuss. I am tempted to give these as gifts to other new parents. Inexpensive, simple and safe.",1
"The product itself is great, but they only sent one massager, not the set of 3. But it was cheap, so whatever....",0
"If you're a big snuggler/spooner, this is not the right pregnancy pillow for you. If you're like me, and you like to have your own comfy little zone in a big bed, this is the one! I got this pillow when I was 11 weeks pregnant (super early!) and now I'm 31 weeks pregnant and have used it EVERY night. The only thing I don't like about it is that if you shimmy up in the night, the fabric at the top of the pillow digs into your shoulder. You can just scoot down, but they should put some elastic in the fabric right at the place where the pillow rests on your shoulder. Otherwise, it is everything I could have hoped for and more. I'm just nervous about weaning off of it when the baby comes!",1
"We purchased the Withings video monitor, which we loved for the first month until we realized it was cutting in and out for hours at a time throughout the night. That device requires constant wifi connection to work properly. As a back-up, we purchased this VTech monitor so we could at least get audio. I'm so happy with the performance and sensitivity of this monitor! It picks up every little sound in the baby's room, which is very reassuring. We also really like the ability to talk to our child if they wake up during the night and just need a few soothing words.",1
This is a very cute cup. But the lid comes off easy. My 15 mo old can get the lid off in 1.5 seconds. And he tips it over and all his juice comes right out. If I could I would of not purchased this cup and bought one more kid proof.,0
"Love this mirror!  My daughter still loves this mirror at 19 months old!She didn't use it too much for tummy time but I loved the idea of the sturdy block holding it up as opposed to some of the folding tummy time mirrors that just tip over.I took it off the block, I used the velcro straps on the back of it (that hold it to the block), to put it in her crib and she absolutely loves having it there.  Every time she wakes up, she talks to herself in the mirror and just plays.  It's so cute.No frills mirror, but it has been fabulous for my daughter!  I like the colors too, just like all the lamaze toys' colors!",1
This is a beautiful rocking horse and well made. Unfortunately mine had a chunk of wood missing out of one of the rockers which snagged the carpet. The company probably would have replaced it but it was easier to put some lacquer on it to smooth it out.,1
"I bought these bottles after doing extensive research and reading the Baby Bargains book.  These bottles are advertised as being clinically proven to reduce colic and gas.  They did not work for my baby who has had horrible gas pains since we brought her home from the hospital.  We recently switched to another brand and her gas pains have virtually disappeared.  Before we couldn't go one feeding without giving her Mylecon and we haven't had to give her any for days now.The other reason I do not like these bottles is their inserts which make it time consuming to clean and put the bottles together.  If they actually reduced gas I probably wouldn't mind, but since it doesn't the inserts are useless and the bottles leak without them.My advice to new moms is to purchase a sample of several types of bottles and determine which is best for your baby and your routine.  Since there are so many more options for BPA free bottles now, you have a good variety to choose from.  Personally, I wouldn't choose these bottles again.",0
"My son goes to a special school, and they liked them so much they got one for every student! they fold up perfect, and are so easy the kids take them up and down, and they are comfortable! I would lay on it! My son says he loves it!",1
"My husband wanted me to get a bottle so he could do some of the feedings for our newest son. This one wasn't on the list of highest rated bottles for breast-feeders but it SHOULD BE! The nipple is AWESOME! The flow is great! The measurements are a little difficult to read, but I appreciate that the shape is such that it doesn't take up a lot of room in my bag. FIVE STARS!!!",1
"Great little snuggy for the little ones. It's very soft and beautiful. Go ahead and buy, you won't be disappointed.",1
This is one of the most secure metal clips we've found yet.  It's cute because it looks like a man's tie too!,1
"The quality is even better than I expected. It is a large book - the binder is beautiful, and the paper is very nice. I love that I can take out and add in different pages since it is loose-leaf.",1
This is a great way to keep everything in the lunch bag evenly cooled.  I bought two for those days he forgets to bring his main lunch box home.,1
"clean, well maintained bottle - no leaksPlease follow the directions before using!!! Those bottles are in my opinion the best bottles on the market.they reduce colic,fussiness and gas like no other.They are a little pricy but i prefer better investment than lousy,cheap buy.answer for yourself - is putting an extra few dollars for a better bottle worth having better and secure sleep of your child etc.?you just got the right bottle :)",1
"I was a little nervous ordering this crib despite all the great reviews, because it was so cheap.  It was something like [...], with free shipping because I have free Prime through Amazon Mom.  The crib arrived in 2 days and is so much better than I dared hope.It didn't have any dings or scratches like some people complained about, and it was reasonably easy to put together (it took my husband and I about an hour and a half - if we took it apart in the future, I'm sure we could reassemble it much more quickly, now that we know what we're doing).  Once assembled, the crib is extremely sturdy and looks gorgeous.  The wood looks and feels high-quality, and it is a rich dark chocolate color, somewhat darker than some of the pictures make it appear.One of the best things about this crib is that it works for tall people.  My husband is 6'3 and I'm 5'9, and I didn't want a crib where I would have to bend way down to put the baby in.  This crib allows you to set the bed height at 3 different levels.  When the baby is new, you can set it quite high to make it easy to lift the baby in and out.  When he gets older and can stand up, you can set the level lower so he can't climb or fall out as easily.I also purchased the Sealy Soybean Foam-Core Crib Mattress, and it fits the crib perfectly, nice and tight so there are no gaps on the sides.One caveat: the crib is just a little too wide to fit through a normal bedroom door, so make sure you set it up in the room you want to keep it in.  I'm sure you could take off one of the sides without too much difficulty if you did need to move it later.",1
"I love this camera!  My brother recommend it as he uses a similar one for his baby.  I use it when I'm out running errands so I can keep an eye out of my own baby (dog of course).  Setup was very easy and quick.  Got it up an running in no time.  The picture quality is good and I can even record.  He's got a bit of separation anxiety so I really like being able to hear and talk to him to calm him down.  Overall, a great camera for my purpose.",1
Works perfect but not sturdy to use for big babies and babies who start to roll over. So the use is limited to only 3 months.,1
"Pros:- stylish- fast- not hot - especially for summer, it is much cooler than other carriers- versatileCons:- hurts back pretty fast!!",1
"The magnetic safety tot lock is by and far the best tot lock on the market. It works by installing a magnetic lock on the back side of the cabinet door, this lock keeps the door from opening at all so there is no chance that your child will accidentally figure out how to open it. There is no practical way your child will be able to open the cabinets without the magnetic key. In fact I would recommend getting a second key in case you lose your first one as there is really no way for an adult to open the lock without the key, normal magnets found in children's toys and on the refrigerator will not work. That being said the installation can be a little difficult but should be no problem if following the template and using proper tools.",1
This is easy and convenient and a wonderful item to have for first time moms and new borns. A must buy for ALL new moms!!,1
These are larger than medela and cheaper too. My only complaint is that the vent doesn't let water pour out very well when I'm do e- scissors fixed that :-),1
My baby loves them. He enjoys looking and touching the bears. they are perfect :). You can easily make their room unique by using such wall stickers.,1
"Small styrofoam balls were in the bag that it came in, though I didn't see any holes in the product,  it made me leery as to how long it would hold up.  This is definitely not worth $48.  It is maybe worth $10.",0
The splash gaurd works well and I never have to worry about my son making a mess like I have with others. The product seems well made and easy enough to take on and off but I think it would be a pain if adults had to share the same toilet.,1
This blanket is the softest muslin that I have ever felt. It is the right size for &#34;snuggling&#34; and washes-dries well. I will probably buy another one !!,1
These are the best baby bottles... And it's a good price!  (12 bottles for what they charge for one of the  &#34;fancy&#34; bottles!),1
"My daughter had the 5 oz bottles, but now she's drinking more, so I had to order the bigger ones.  The nipples work great for her because they aren't too big and we never have any leaking.",1
These diapers are the best.  They are a great product and are so cute.  Bonnie is great if you ever need help with your order.  She ships them out very quickly.  These are a great investment if you are cloth diapering!,1
"Get the Luxe...it is worth the extra money. Great product. I got it as a shower gift and didn't think that I would want it, so I keeped it in it's bag for a possible return. I had my baby and decided to give it a try first. He loves it. The fleece makes it that much more warm and inviting. Tried the standard boppy...it's fine but for a few dollars more it will make a impact in comfort. Good Luck.",1
Really cheap and flimsy. Also the little pices are that you put in Mickey Mouse are pretty small. Disappointed with this one,0
Love this back pack. Perfect size for a toddler!! Built strong!!! Bought the matching lunch bag as well!!!! Great item!!,1
"I bought this for my special needs daughter and she enjoys the colors, scent and the noise the legs make when squeezing them.  I was wondering if the red rear leg was defective though because it barely squeeks when she squeezes it?  I can get it to work better because I have bigger hands and can squeeze it harder.  Either way it's making her current hospital stay a little better since this toy distracts her during play.",1
Bath time finally became much easier. I really recommend this product to anyone even though it is made out of foam.,1
"My son is fed only breast milk.  Since both my wife and I work full time he had to learn to feed from a bottle during day care.  We bought a wide array of bottles, knowing it was going to be a challenge to get him on to the bottle after solely being breast fed.  The first we tried was Dr. Brown's.  He took only a few moments of convincing, and then took the bottle like a champ.  We never even tried the other bottles we bought as testers, just bought 6 more 4oz Dr. Brown's bottles, and they have worked great.  He needs burping after breast feeding, and if anything he needs less burping after bottle feeding.He was a colicky baby from about weeks 5 to 8.  This bottle didn't eliminate the colic, but it remained manageable through the worst period.  Now that he's 9 weeks old and regularly feeding from Dr. Brown's bottles he has no more colicky symptoms, and I wouldn't dare try a different bottle!  Highly recommended for any infant.",1
My husband keeps bumping his head on the corners of our glass hood that hangs over the cook top.  I put double sided clear tape on the edge cushions to keep them in place and no more forehead bruises for tall hubbie.  I took off one star because I had to find a solution to keep them in place on the slightly rounded corners of the hood - not the cushions fault at all.,1
This does not work well after awhile.  The suction just isn't as strong anymore.,0
"I looked around a lot for a product where I could keep my twins close at night. The idea of having 2 seperate bassinets was just not going to work. I didn't want to seperate my twins & wanted the convenience of having them at arm's reach. My twins are 2 months now & so far the co-sleeper has been very convenient. I could just pick them right up & start feeding. If they cry, I don't need to get out of bed to check up on them. I could just pat them while I'm still laying down. The only inconvenience is the size. Of course I need it to be big so I could fit them both. But it takes up about half the size of my Cal King bed. I have to crawl half way down to get out. But other than that, I really like it. It has side compartments to keep receiving blankets & burp cloths handy. I'm glad I purchased it & would recommend it. No one said being a mom is going to be easy.",1
"These diapers fit great on my Preemie at about 8 weeks (8lbs) but she peed through them every time even with a cover, I had to change her clothes. I'm new to all the cloth diapers but I have found that the pocket diapers are the best. These are bulky you would think it would hold pee but it did not. They are cute and fit great. No problem with the snaps. I gave them 2 stars because of how soaked they get with a cover.",0
I have an uppababy vista. All the UB cup holders are crap. This one is less expensive and perfect! Easy to install (not sure why people are saying it is difficult to attach). Can attach it to the side or back by push bar. Stays well. Fits nearly any size cup. Got one for my sister's stroller as well.,1
"All I can say about this product is the following:- my wife received them for a baby shower gift, among other brands- my wife is almost out of them, our child is 2.5 months old (box of 60)- my wife is asking me to reorder these pads because she likes them and they worked as advertisedIt's a matter of personal preference for most, and I'm sure different situations call for different pads (performance, fit, comfort, etc) but my wife likes them and wants more, so I will give it 4 stars.  They aren't perfect, but they're the best that she has tried (we received a few different types as gifts).",1
"These pins were too dull to use for diapering. It was almost impossible to get the pin through two layers of fabric. The plastic caps seemed to be of reasonable quality, but I had to return them as they were just not sharp enough.",0
"Bought this for my brother and sister n law. They have used it since they received it, their son is now 1 1/2. I only had to pop it up one time. My husband and I had some difficulty but once we figured it out it was a breeze. I would highly recommend this piece on functionality and design! It is way cuter in person!",1
"I thought you got four nesting cutters in this set, so I was a little disappointed there, but I just missed that info, I don't feel I was misled. These are smaller than you'd think, which was perfect for me, since I like small cutters to add small details to cute lunches, or to make tiny sandwiches for my girls.",1
"I bought this to keep my 2 cats out of my basement.. I like to keep the door open for wood stove heat circulation purposes. It works great! I've had it a year now and I've had no problems. I will note that the locking mechanism is plastic. I don't use it for my needs - just closing it secures it enough for my purposes. So I'm not sure of the longevity of the lock.. My CATS have never jumped this, and they are very curious about getting into the basement. It fits securely in the doorway and is very easy to open and enter and exit through. A great product that fits my needs.",1
"sooo easy to clean, from the tray to the harness! simple to install to your chair. we should have bought this sooner :)",1
"My baby girl LOVES this jumper! She is almost 8 months old, but she's loved this thing since she was a little baby. When she first went in it, she couldn't really jump or anything (too young), but she loved to stare at the toys and play with them. Now she goes in it all the time and bounces around and plays with the toys. She can now reach the hippo and monkey and loves to play with them. I really think her favorite place to be (besides Mommy holding her) is in this bouncer! :)There are a lot of toys for her to play with. The seat spins so she's able to see them all.  The seat seems like it's comfortable and flexible. The music isn't too annoying, in my opinion. This bouncer is adjustable to 3 different heights.The only downside was that it took a while for her to be able to reach the floor, even on the lowest setting. She IS kinda on the short side, so that's part of it. But when she couldn't reach, she wasn't quite old enough to bounce around anyway, and she still loved to look at the toys. Now she can reach really well and she bounces and bounces and bounces for EVER! She lovvvvves it.",1
"This is wonderful for covering not-so-clean restaurant highchairs and cushioning shopping cart seats.  The colors are bright and Baby loves to chew on it.  There are 3 cloth hooks on the front for attaching toys.  Wonderful idea!  My son can have a few toys to play with and be entertained all through dinner.  It rolls up for storage in the car - not great, but smaller.",1
"I read the reviews on this product and there were some mixed opinions. So, I decided to purchase the product because it was affordable and I needed a drying rack for my baby things. I was a little skeptical about buying it because some reviews said that it wasn't strong enough to hold the bottles. I have to say that I'm glad I bought it because it work for me. It holds all my baby bottles, pacificers,and more. It doesn't take up alot of counter space either. I like the fact that you can spin the rack and it is easy to assemble. I have no complaints so far so good. I highly recommend this product.",1
This pacifier does not stay cold very long. Our son actually likes to chew on the handle instead of the raspberry.,0
This product came quickly and in great packaging. I used this with my first child and now I am having twins and know that it will work great!,1
Great for keeping the paci cean.  Attaches very easily to just about anything and holds many sized paci's well. I never have to worry about the cleanliness of my baby's paci when I pull it out of my purse.  Also matches my bella tunno diaper bag perfectly!,1
"Yay! I've been needing a bottle brush to clean out my Nalgene water bottles, and this one does the trick. It has soft bristles that won't scratch, but they're sturdy enough to scrub scale and other residue. I've also been using it to clean the bottom corners and sides of coffee mugs that have dried-on stains, and it works great.",1
"I have been using one-size FuzziBunz since my baby was born 6 months ago.  I had purchased 24 diapers before her birth, and then ordered 12 more a few weeks after her birth.  The 12 additional diapers I ordered were different from the other diapers I'd bought.  I was surprised by this, but kept them anyway because we needed them right away.  I really like my original one-size FuzziBunz diapers, but the 12 additional diapers have been a major disappointment.  I would like to share my thoughts regarding the changes that were made:- The minky inserts do seem to slide in easier than the microfiber ones when I'm assembling the diapers after each wash.- I really dislike that the adjustable elastic and buttons are now on the inside of the diaper.  This has made changing the size of each diaper a major pain (turn diaper inside out, adjust sizing, turn diaper right side out, stuff with inserts, try on baby, find out it's not quite right, pull out inserts, repeat process multiple times until I finally figure out a good setting).  Definitely way more time-consuming than adjusting our original FuzziBunz diapers!- My number one complaint and biggest frustration by far is the fact that the minky inserts aren't nearly as absorbent as the microfiber inserts of our other FuzziBunz diapers.  We only use the minky diapers as daytime diapers and, even then, I often have to change my baby's outfit because of urine leaks.  It seems the minky diapers don't last for more than an hour or so before they leak, so we only use them in between naps and try to avoid using them when we're away from the house.  And we don't dare use them overnight.When the diapers I have eventually wear out, I hope I will be able to find some of the original FuzziBunz to buy.  If not, I will have to figure out a different brand of cloth diapers to use.  I hope FuzziBunz will consider reinstating the features of the original diapers that were so much better than the newer version.",0
it came in a nice sealed package. the tubing is a little yellow but it works good for a back up.,0
"You can't go wrong with a Boppy. I love them. I have one from 2.5 years ago that I use every day on my couch. It's just so comfy. My MIL just bought me a new one, since I'm expecting again in June.",1
I thought my little busy body child wouldn't be able to get them off the door but soon enough he figured it out how to shake the door and they fall off easily.,0
Great !,1
"We have a new decoration for my 2-year old daughter's room -- this handpainted jungle-themed ceramic piggy bank (measures 7 in round and 8 in long) from Child to Cherish.  I had ordered it off of Amazon.com for only $14.99, plus shipping and handling. There are several design options available, and pricing ranges from $14.99 up to $25.00.Being a huge fan of Toy Story and seeing Hammy the pig in the movie, Savannah instantly knew the bank was shaped as a pig the moment she laid eyes on it.  Just as I was pulling it out of the box, she began yelling with excitement, ""Piggy, Piggy.""  I didn't think she would understand what it was, or how to put change into it, but she quickly caught on.  She got so involved in the process of adding change to the piggy bank, that it kept her entertained for over an hour.  Bless the piggy bank, as it calmed her down and kept her sitting in one place! :-)  In addition to talking to her about putting the money in the bank to save, I also used the piggy bank as an educational tool for teaching her how to count from 1-10.  She was able to count to five before.  As she added each coin into the slot, I would count.  Once we reached ten, we would cheer and clap, making learning how to count fun.This bank would make a great baby shower gift or gift to young child.I was sent this bank to review.  The views above are mine and mine alone.",1
My son bit off the original spouts and buying new cups is just wasteful.  I looked online and was so glad to see them on there.  I ordered them right away and they came quickly.  We had to use a little force to get them on but they were great and for the price it was cheaper then buying new cups.,1
"I registered for this after reading all the reviews and I've been nothing but happy with it. I tried my sister's diaper genie and the diaper champ is so much easier to use. The fact that I use the same bags for my kitchen as I do the champ makes it that much easier. I just leave some in the bottom of the champ then I don't have to go looking for them. I've never noticed a smell, and although I do agree that it is hard to open, you get used to it and it's worth it!",1
The directions are terrible. Poor illustrations and vaguely written descriptions. Just a bummer to put together.,0
"I purchased this for a shower gift after using one with my three kids.  My kids loved being in it.  When I look at all the items new parents &#34;need&#34;, I would put this right after a high chair and stroller.  It can be easily disassembled and stored for baby #2.",1
"We have had this stroller for almost four years and we LOVE it. This stroller is easy to control, the back lays down almost flat, and it folds up small to put into the trunk of a car. The only improvement I wish I would have had would have been the ability to stick the pumpkin car seat into the stroller some how, but to be honest they outgrow the pumpkin car seat so quickly and they will be able to use this stroller so much longer that I would definitely purchase this if I had to do it again. Although the manufacturer would probably not like it, we have on numerous occasions, put both kids into this one stroller. We put the back all of the way down, put the oldest in the back and the youngest in the front. This lasts until they start to fight with each other. In a pinch it works great! We even took it with us on a trip and stuck it into a stroller bag for the plane and it held up pretty well.",1
"We keep these in our &#34;grab and go&#34; diaper bag (which just includes diapers, wipes, outfit change and a formula nursette and nipple), and they have been awesome to have when you need to change a diaper without a changing table. I lay these down in the car, on sink counter tops, and the changing stations at public restrooms.",1
"Soft, comfortable, and not overly obvious.  Perhaps not for the early days of breastfeeding when leaking is more problematic (in my case, disposables were best at that point), but just what I needed after those first 2 months.",1
"This is really an ideal booster for a toddler who's ready to sit in a regular chair but is too short to comfortably reach the table. In my opinion, it's just what it ought to be:  convenient to use, easy to clean, attractive but very neutral, portable, and stable. My toddler and his cousin both seem comfortable and confident while sitting in it. I think the basic design keeps them from feeling it's too babyish.Obviously note that this isn't for babies or young toddlers; there are no straps to hold them in or secure this to a chair. The age recommendation of 3+ seems spot on. This is a great next step when graduating from a high-chair, as my son will do soon. In the meantime, though he's not quite three, this has already been handy (with a little extra supervision) to take when we eat in other homes or if he needs a boost to be taller on the piano bench. It's been great as well to have on hand for older toddlers who visit our home. It certainly beats offering to let them sit on a stack of books!",1
"Bought this for my son when he was born. The animal was a little small so it didnt quite keep the pacifier in place, but for the price it was great!",1
"All I know is my Grandson sleep like a Baby, now in our house.  He is happy and rested when he gets up at 19 months.Very happy with purchase.",1
"I really loved the fabric, great texture and it seems to be very warm.The size is perfect for a baby crib.",1
"Easy to use, all steel, many mounting options, looks great.  I ordered a second one.  Do not buy anything else.",1
"If you are small-busted, read this! Post-pregnancy, I went from an A-size to a B-size.  After 4-5 days, the massaging pad blistered my skin on the areola.  After calling Avent and taking a week off, I now use it without the massaging pad.  I also went from 2 oz per side to 3-4 oz per side.  I am a stay-at-home mom, and pump one side every morning to have some milk on hand.  Listen to your Dr and friends and use an electric if going back to work.Also, this is not ""whisper quiet"".  The handle sqeaks!  Avent even sent me a replacement handle, but no improvement.",0
"Wow.  Who would've thought you could get everything you needed at such great quality at such a low price?  Our little one just started scooting across the room rapidly, so we figured it was time to get a gate to keep him out of the kitchen.  I had a coupon from Babies R Us for 10% off baby gates (priced $25 or more), so we went in and took a look at the selection, which was pretty good, actually.  Gates ranged in price from around $20 - over $70, which seems like a wide range.  We were hoping to stay at the low end, so we ruled out several right away.  I was worried about the toeholds on the diamond or square metal mesh of the really cheap gates in case our baby turns out to be a climber.  But the things that we saw in the more expensive gates (solid panel, ability to swing on a hinge, etc.) were all in this gate!  Not to mention the fact that you could also use it without the hinge, and it had the ability to be used on uneven door frames.  We had the intention of putting it up on a hinge because of the inconvenience of taking it out and putting it back all the time, but tried it without and discovered it's so easy, we don't even really NEED to mount it to the doorframe!  For anybody worried about the strength of unmounted gates, I honestly wasn't expecting it to hold so firmly!  You put it in and expand it to fit the opening tightly, then push down on the handle to lock in place, which  tightens it even further.  All these pros and I can see no cons so far!  With the coupon (we received in the mail, I think because we made a baby registry at our local store before our son was born), we got the gate for less than $30, including tax.  Can't beat that!",1
"This rattle is beautiful.  It is very smooth and has a nice subtle sound.  I bought this for my almost 3 year old, who despite the natural coloring, will track the rattle when it's shaken.  To my surprise, my 20 month old also finds this interesting and has been chewing on it ever since he first found it.  I was also stunned to see that there are absolutely no teeth marks!  We have the maple and are ordering the cherry.",1
"First the bad : we have a standard Moen tub faucet.  The Flo doesn't *quite* sit right on the faucet, so we have to play with it a bit to get all the water to go down the slope, rather than out the back of the Flo.  But it's not really a big deal, just takes a bit of adjusting.The good :  My daughter (11 months old) loves to play with the water coming from the faucet.  The Flo allows her to sit a little further back (thus sparing me stress every time she gets a little tippy!), and she also really delights in the waterfall effect.  When she gets older, I think the bubble bath dispenser will be more appreciated.Speaking of which, other reviewers have mentioned the bubble bath leaking out -- I have seen a few drops in the ""scoop"" under the faucet, but nothing major.  It's been on a week, and I've yet to need to refill it.I haven't had any problems with mess with this either.  Even when I didn't have it adjusted just right and water was washing backwards under the faucet, it didn't go everywhere, it just ran down the tub side (INSIDE the tub).If it wasn't for the slightly finicky adjustment necessary, I'd have given this 5 stars!",1
"I bought these because they are the only all-cotton-inside all-in-one diapers I could find. I couldn't be happier! They are perfect for daytime use as they are, and work well at night with an extra doubler stuffed inside. They wash up great in my HE machine, and dry just as fast as my fitted diapers do. And they're the cutest gosh-darn diapers I have ever seen!Due to the cost, I waited to try these until my baby's growth leveled off a bit at 4.5 months, and I think that was the right choice. She's a super-chunky 19 lbs., so I bought them in Large. She's just big enough to get a good fit on the tightest setting. I think she'll get to her first birthday with these, but not much beyond. I'm already wishing they made them in Extra Large so we could use this kind all the way until potty training. Regular sized babies probably could, but not my big girl!Excellent value, excellent product!UPDATE:Well, we didn't get anywhere close to 12 months with these- made it to 9 months. Once she hit a 5 in disposables, these were too small. They fit great when she wore a 3-4, though. A normal-to-petite baby would probably be able to wear these for quite awhile.But the quality is really outstanding. After 4 months in HEAVY rotation, they still look brand new. They should be able to be used by AT LEAST one more baby.",1
"I was very disappointed that this did not fit on a Target shopping cart. I have tried several times to get it to fit and it just rolls back up. It does, however, fit well on restaurant high chairs (maybe because they are smaller than carts?). I am considering returning mine - NOT PLEASED!",0
It is s very simple way to help your kids start walking !!; try it !!!. We are already using it !!!,1
"The sunshade came defected.However, it does look like a piece of fabric. I thought it would be thicker.The snaps were sawed wrong and didn't snap around the stroller frame.",0
"These are great cups and an essential to early childhood development!  I have a 17 month old baby that is delayed.  These cups have greatly helped her with finger dexterity and with her ability to learn how to fit things together, stack, and knock over.  I've had many other mothers ask me where I have gotten these when their babies have also become intrigued with this simple toy.  Stacking cups, blocks, and balls are the essentials for what every developing baby needs and these ones are great!",1
"I would give this item five stars on quality, but gave it four because they are very expensive for what they are. Given that you can purchase a full sized Lifefactory bottle for the same as what these cost with the additional cost of sippy caps, it's a little disheartening that these cost this amount. However, they are rated highly by most everyone who uses them, and we were looking for glass containers for our children to use to drink from. We don't want them using containers that contain the toxic chemicals so common in everything now - even baby stuff - so we decided it would be worth the extra money for the peace of mind that our children are not ingesting toxins every time they drink. These are good quality, and are the perfect size for our 2 yr old to hold herself and drink from. She has requested to use these particular containers almost every time she gets a drink, since they arrived. We had to order the sippy caps separately, as she no longer uses a bottle, so it added to our cost for these, which is my only gripe. The silicone sleeves are very nice quality and very &#34;grippy&#34;, which makes it easy for our daughter to hold them. The colours are also really nice and are her two favourite colours, so that's a winning point as well. They seem to wash very easily in the dishwasher, and I like knowing that if she doesn't finish her water all in one go, that there will not be anything leaching into her beverage while it sits on the countertop. I am a bit leery of what might happen if it gets dropped, though so we'll see if these last the pace. Since they are made of glass, I am glad for the silicone sleeves, as hopefully that will help delay breakage if they are dropped from a small height...I have dropped the bigger ones a couple of times but they seem not to be prone to breaking easily, so all in all, I would recommend these. I just wish they didn't charge so much for them...I find it very frustrating that everything &#34;healthy&#34; has to cost so much more than conventional items. I want to do the best by my children and give them what will enhance their health and not endanger it, but I feel that it's unfair that the only alternative for more affordable items means that I would then have to accept items which are made using toxic chemicals that offgass and leach...",1
My son  started to teething since he was 4 month and this has become his first and foremost important things for him in his life. The doll is bit smaller than I thought but I guess he is OK with it. I ended up ordering dino one for daycare so he can keep his bear at home. Great product and the only downside is that I cannot change pacifier part. So I gave 4 stars.,1
"Its good when it works, however the motor feels like it cant handle it most of the time. It feels like its dying and revving up. I did contact the manufacturer and they sent me a new one and it still does the same thing. I dont know what the problem really is...",0
I love this seat.  I keep it in a wet bag with spray hand sanitizer and some wipes.  Perfect for when we are out of the house.  Just spray the bottom before folding back up.  Makes potty in public a dream!!,1
"This adapter works well with our rented Medela pump, but it is NOT a Medela product. Just a generic 12v charger.",0
"We have two in diapers and try to live an active life!  We have shopped fancy outdoor brands for a functional diaper pack. I never would have guessed that a pack from fisher price would have the best design features. Outside diaper pocket, bottle insulator, and especially the wipe dispenser top the list.  Another neat addition are two little loops at the top of the pack that allow your to quickly attach to a jogging stroller or shopping cart.",1
"I bought two of these 2-pack inserts. I wish I had done it sooner. They make overnight diapering easy. My daughter is two, and keeping a toddler dry at night is a challenge. I simply use ONE of these stuffed into the pocket diaper of our choice along with the inserts that diaper came with. great quality. They are great because if you find a diaper you like to use, all you have to do is add this and you have an overnight solution. Also great for marathon day trips.",1
"If you get only one potty seat for your home, this should be it! It's sturdy, easy to place and easy for kids to use. It's perfect!",1
"I've got this high chair as a baby shower present and what can i say  I simply love it and most importantly my v. hard to please daughter too. It was the only thing at the time went by to keep my daughter occupy. It's spacious enough to slide my daughter chubby legs in and out , she'd have plenty of space on a side. The tray is wide enough to hold not only foods but toys and with the time you can use it as a mini table so your child can enjoy playing with dough or draw the scrap books. I would disagree with a previous review about the wheels. I've never had any problems with it on either carpet or wood surface.Also, for those who are not only after the practicality of it but design too you can't go wrong with this. Anyone who entered my house has always complemented on the chair. It looks very stylish. As for me i have not discovered any cons. It worked for me very well for 2 years. I would definitely recommended to a friend or even buy it as a gift as it's great.",1
"the baby doesn't like the plasticky texture, she is much better off eating the new fruits from a stick. also the mesh is so fine that really only juice comes through. this is a gross product and a little over paranoid.",0
If you don't match them up just right they don't latch.  Other than that they work great. I would agree with a previous review that says extra tape would be nice in case you mess up.,1
I don't hate it.  But I really don't like it.  I guess I was hoping for some miracle item that could help teach my tot to drink out of a regular cup.  In reality I don't think that product exists.  This certainly wasn't it.  The holes are quite big and according to my toddler quite fun to turn upside and pour water out of.  When he tried to drink out of it we had the same result (if not worse) as when he drinks out of a regular cup.  Perhaps he's too young and we'll try again in a few months but for now this cup is going to the back of the cupboard.,0
"Small, portable and convenient to use in the car. Given it is for emergencies we have not used it yet, but my daughter likes it and I don't see any issues when the time comes.",1
"These are super cute and a great idea, but my kid has zero interest in them. I have tried them multiple times over the last 3 months and the most use they have gotten is to be sucked on. However, they are a reasonable price and worth a shot. Not all kids are alike.",1
"Too many parts, not easy top clean, is heavy for the baby. We love the tommee tippe sippers which is light weight & has fewer parts & the cap is attached so i dont lose it.",0
I am new to cloth diapering.  I've ordered this product twice now.  Most of the time the liner works and can catch the solid waste so that I can then dump it and the liner straight into the toilet.  Sometimes it bunches funny and it doesn't catch everything.  I've learned to make sure that the liner isn't sticking out of the diaper.  This will cause leaks.  I just make sure to do a visual scan at the end of a diaper change and tuck it in if it's sticking out anywhere.,1
"I looked for ages for a toddler sized pillow that was safe for my son. He was 12 months when I found this one, and until I did he was sleeping with a couple of his stuffed animals. When I put it in his crib, he immediately snuggled up with it, and he now sleeps with it every night. He loves his pillow!A nice plus, is that the cover comes off and is washable. This is important when he gets sick and gets boogies, throw-up, or diaper explosion fall-out on it... and it didn't shrink in the dryer either.",1
Super cute music mobile. It seems to be quite steady and safe and it adjusts to the crib tightly. I am worried the colors are not so vivid for a infant to notice but it is so cute anyway! :),1
"I went back and forth between getting this larger kidsme feeder, or the small size. My baby boy was 5 1/2 months when I bought it, and I ultimately decided to get the larger size. I am SO glad I did. It's the perfect size for him, and he loves it! The holes are a good size, and he doesn't have any issues with getting choked up on the pieces that come through. I also feel that the clasp is very secure, and I don't foresee my little guy being able to open it at all. Mine takes a decent amount of force to open it, but not too much..it's really just right. I will say that the plastic insert gets stained from food, but that doesn't really bother me. Overall, this is a tremendous product, and I would definitely recommend it to others! The biggest negative is the price, but this is the only feeder I have used, so I can't speak for justifying the money spent compared to other feeders.",1
My son loves these insulated cups because they are easy for him to release the straw and it stays clean in his preschool lunch box.  The only problem is it leaks.,0
"I think I finally found our solution for night lights!  I had followed some links for night lights and came across Kinderglo and their fun and unique night lights.  I had trouble deciding between the Brontosaurus and T-Rex.  I love that the light can rotate through different colors or just stay on one color the whole time.  The exterior is softer than the Tyke Light.  It recharges during the day and does not use up batteries.  It also has an automatic off after 30 minutes.  My son loved his little Brontosaurus from first sight!  He would carry it around all day (making it a challenge to get fully charged).  Sadly, after the first night, his new little bedtime buddy was not working.  :-(  I emailed the manufacturer and they IMMEDIATELY mailed me a replacement along w/ a mailing slip to return the damaged light.  We have had no problems with the new little dino.  My niece even loved the dino light when she borrowed it while visiting - perfect for that special little boy or girl in your life!  I highly recommend picking up one of the many varieties of Kinderglo lights available!",1
"I purchased the Zoli stick gum massagers along with the Teethifier for my 15 month old, who is cutting his first set of molars. He never used a pacifier, so I wasn't sure how that product would work for us. Honestly, he doesn't use either of the back-teeth teethers much, but before bed he'll chew on the Teethifier while we read books, and I leave it with him in his crib. Sometimes I find him chewing on it in the morning. It does make him drool a ton. He has not used the Zoli stick teethers more than a handful of times, and most of the time he turns it around and chews on the non-rubbery end. I worry that he'll push it too  far into his mouth when using it that way, since the stopper is at the other end. All in all, if your little one's molars seem to be bothersome, I would recommend the Teethifier over these stick teethers.",0
"We tried similar sippy cups from the grocery store before we bought this. The grocery store ones were cheaper in price and material but the holes were smaller so they leaked less. When I remember, I try not to let baby run around wih anything else other than water in the tilty because it easily sprays liquid when shaken and it will also leak more when tossed and left upside down on the floor.The tilty cups were better at letting baby reach more of the drink so less drinks are wasted in that way. Also because of the tilt it holds less. We would have to fill the other cup all the way to give baby good access to the drinks.Tilty cups were also easier to clean by hand washing especially with the spout. They are more annoying for the dishwashers sometimes because the underside would collect dirt and water even with the drain holes. The drain holes are so small, food would get stuck and block the water while in the wash.The grocery store cups came with this great stopped you put on the spout that I wish the tilty would come with. From reviews, it looks like he separate lid you can buy is not so good. I wanted to buy the other lid types also but I am discouraged from doing so because they are more expensive than the cups with lids!Lastly, baby is still confused sometimes about how the cup should go. Sometimes she tries to drink from it while it's upside down and she can't get anything out of it. I don't know if that's a good or bad thing. I just help her turn the cup around.Overall a good learning cup.",0
Great bib.  Very absorbent.  We put this on our little girl (5 1/2 months) when we took her to our favorite sushi restaurant and it was a huge hit with all the staff.,1
"I should have just gotten a regular baby tub. The sides are just vinyl, the inflatable bottom is nice, the feet of the tub are kind of difficult to put in place without a lot of force. Unless space is truly at a premium, you're better off getting a traditional baby tub. This one is harder to clean with all the crevices in the vinyl bottom and since it is vinyl, it will not be as durable as a molded plastic tub. For the same price I should have gotten a regular tub. Unless you are going to store this under the sink or something, go with something simple.",0
I gave this to my husband for fathers day and he loved it!  It's nicely made and seems sturdy. I would recommend!,1
"Lovely design, face and soft cloth body. Organic. Put it in your shirt so it smells of you when your baby simply must go down for a nap, go to the babysitter, or most comforting of all, when going to the pediatrician to get inspected. : )",1
First I must say that this is a really cute toy!We got this for our baby girl when she was 6 months old and she loves playing with them all.We've washed everything except the milk which we spot clean and they've all held up well.,1
"My baby isn't here yet, but it's #4, and I KNOW what I'm looking for in a wrap! I've tried it on, and even secured my 3 year old in it with no problem. The material is quite long, and it seems it will drag on the ground when attempting to put it on, but I got it on with no problems, just by following the directions in the package. Can't wait to snug my new baby into it!",1
Love it. It's a very ood quality and it looks very elegant. My baby can easily break under it too.,1
"Great price, and a good size, and matches our decor. Very easy to put together.  Very cute and seems very durable.",1
"Some of the other reviews made me hesitant to order this monitor, but I'm so glad I bought it.  We've been using this about two months and love it!  When expecting our second child we decided to buy a second video monitor (the monitor for our first child is also Summer Infant Video Monitor - we've had it almost two years and love it as well).  The handheld unit is the perfect size, has excellent picture and we love the rechargeable battery.  It's made it extremely easy to both watch and hear our daughter.  We had no complaints at all about this product and highly recommend it.",1
No smell and it is firm but comfy  Recommended as a second mattress at grandparents house that is how we are using it.  Baby seems to sleep well and no problems,1
"This is the best swim diaper. The disposable Huggie ones are convenient, but this save a lot of money. It has double walls around the thighs to protect from poo getting in the pool. We've never had a poo leak. It's adjustable at the waist. This will seriously fit my 5 week old 10 pounder, my 2 year old 25 pounder, and my 3 year old 32 pounder. That's pretty versatile!",1
"great mobile, the fish are lightweight so they move very easily with a little air flow and look beautiful. not too large, so works well even with lower ceilings. the worm is a great touch. love it!",1
"We already had some of the Playtex drop-in nursers, and have never been disappointed with the quality or performance.  I was pleased that this newborn gift set included storage components for those who are pumping milk (pump adapter ring, liner ring, sealing disk, etc.).These ""premium"" nursers are also a nice, subtle color scheme.  I have no color preferences (these are pale yellow, blue, and green), but was pleased they had no additional decorations.  This set contains the silicone nipples.I would recommend this set without hesitation.  We have no issues with leaks, baby doesn't seem to ingest any extra air, and the convenience of disposable liners is hard to beat.",1
"This ""seat"" is an absolute lifesaver the first few months!  Yes, they do outgrow it after 6 months or so (depending on the size of your baby) - but think of it as getting a lot of extra sleep and peace for 6 months or so.  If this is your first baby, you might not realize how much you'd trade for some sleep - but trust me, it is well worth it.  One of the reasons that babies sleep SOOOO much better in this for naps, etc, is that they are at an angle - aiding in breathing and digestion (and a lifesaver for any child with ""silent"" reflux - the kind that goes into their esophogus and burns, but doesn't make them spit-up, and often goes undetected).  It is at an angle for the same reason they are at an angle in the hospital bassinets.Plus, when they are awake, they can SEE everything - which makes a huge difference in their happiness.  My daughter adored this seat and was very happy to hang-out as long as she could see what was going on and could be involved that way.  I only wish they had made these when I had my first child!",1
Very happy with our purchase.  Our daughter really likes to bounce in this jumperoo.  Lots of toys to keep her busy.  Overall a great value.  Very safe and stable.  Soft toy bar allows you to attach additional toys.  I would recommend this to friends.,1
The description didnt really state that these aren't your average size bibs. They are huge. So basically they are too big for my 5  month old. There is a hug gap between her neck and the bib so they dont serve the purpose. I guess I have to wait for her to be much older to use these. I wish they have been more clear on the size that way I wouldnt have wasted my time ordereing these.,0
Got this pillow because I've been having a hard time sleeping at night. COuld not find a comfortable position. Ever since I got this pillow when I was 18 weeks pregnant I've been sleeping throughout the night except for the occassional trips to the bathroom. Great support for the back and the belly. LOVE IT!!!!!,1
"This booster seat is easy to clean, aesthetically appealing and gets the job done. It doesn't have any bells and whistles, but that's exactly what I was wanting. It does not attach to a chair or have a seatbelt which I personally appreciated, but if you are looking for &#34;safety features&#34; this is not the booster for you.",1
"My baby boy loved this thing because of the mobile. No matter how bad things got, no matter how old he was, it ALWAYS calmed him down, during the worst teething and everything. The motor NEVER ran out on me, perhaps because I didn't use it for hours at a time (babies should only be in it about 30-45 minutes when they are young and awake, and only a few hours while asleep because they need to move and grow and not get a flat head). My son is 9 month old now, 22 lbs, 29 inches and he still loves the mobile and still fits in it, but unfortunately is too big and mobile to be in it safely anymore. So it breaks my heart but I will need to sell it as that time has passed.The only thing that I hated about this was that we had to stop using the safety straps by about 3-4 months because my son (who was a big baby) grew too fast, but this is an issue with other Fisher Price products too. The straps are removable though so you can probably just buy some more. If my baby was less of a &#34;stare at stuff and observe quietly&#34; baby this wouldn't have worked or been safe enough for him. Babies like my first, my daughter, who are very extremely active will likely grow out of this sooner but my son was very peaceful in this thing from day one and it is still in great condition.",1
"We use this thermometer for our infant, and it's fairly accurate. We usually have to perform 3-5 readings, and we go by the average.  An example of one run would be 97.8, 97.9, 98.2, 97.8.  We're really happy with it because it's too difficult to take her temperature accurately without measuring rectally. (Yuck! Who wants to do that?) Should we suspect my toddler has a fever, we will be using it on him as well.",1
"my daughter is 17 months old. I know it's early, but she sometimes will sit on her potty when mommy goes to the bathroom. however, if she sits on it without her diaper, it seems to be very uncomfortable for her. She squirms a lot and ends up leaning on the back of the potty so as to not have her butt on the seat. I'll have to update this review as she gets older.",0
"This is not a toy for us, but rather a therapy tool. Seems to be durable, although we have only used it a few weeks. Super quick shipping, item is as described. Super quick shipping, great communication. Good company to purchase from. Thank you.",1
"VERY SOFT AND THICK. MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS BLANKET, WHICH IS USED AS HER SCHOOL BLANKET.  I WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN.",1
This fits our boppy cover perfect.  It's at least $10 if not $15 cheaper here than anywhere else.  LOVE IT.,1
"We bought this with high hopes that it would be a good solution for our 22 month old, who likes to throw his plate with food when he is done. Unfortunately we took one look at this out of the box and promptly put it back in to return. The plastic plate, spoon, and fork do not ""pop in and out"" as the product description assures. They just sit loosely on top of the place mat, so that the utensils fall off every time the place mat moves, and the plate can be pulled up easily and tossed just the same as any other plastic plate. The place mat itself has some rubber backing on it, but doesn't adhere AT ALL to a wood table top, and is too big to fit on a high chair tray. I don't see how this product is useful in any way. The only positive part of this product is that it looks nice: very modern and streamlined. But if you are trying to find something that will keep food, or the plate, on the table during mealtimes, this is not your product!",0
"I like these spoons. They are chubby for little hands to grip well and are not real big. They are lightweight and seem to work well. The only drawback would be the size of the bowl. It is not wide (which is good) but the bowl of the spoon is deep. My little one has to stick it in her mouth twice to get the entire bite off the spoon. This might remedy itself as she gets older (she is only 15 months old), but it is something to think about. The spoons are durable and can be washed in the dishwasher.",1
"We took this stroller to Atlantis for our 9 month baby. It made our lives so much easier. Travelling on d flights, it was lightweight, swivelled easily. Reclined for sleeping or sitting up. A storage basket for our adventurous vacay days. LOVED IT. Would have paid 3x as much.",1
"I was skeptical and cautious, but was willing to try anything to help my baby clear up her eczema. I saw clear and amazing results after my baby started wearing it! Within a few days, her breakouts had completely stopped. My husband has had eczema for much of his life and it's almost completely gone! He wears one it non-stop now. I have one I wear on my wrist... I can't tell that it has helped me much at all, but eczema is caused by different things in different people, so this may not work for everyone.",1
"Terrible! The frame is SUPER TINY & holds a photo no larger than 2"""". This should have been made emphatically clear prior to purchase.",0
"It's is the most comfortable chair, it's big but it fit perfectly in my nursery, I didn't want one of those wood an upholstered chair that creak after a month and paying the extra few dollars was definitely worth it with this one. Easy to put together and works great!",1
"When I saw it was a cuddly blanky, I expected it to be about the size if a pillow. I didnt realize it was like a night time security toy. still cute, a lot over priced.",0
"Ok, I've had this chair now for 7 years!  It has been through three children so far and held up perfectly.  I love that it takes up so little room compared to a regular stand alone high-chair.  we have a small house, so that was important to us.  It is also easy to take along if we go away for the weekend or something, again, taking up very little room.  It's cute, with its little hippo table grabbers.  All our kids have loved those!  The fabric seat/cover is moderately easy to remove and can be tossed into the laundry no problem.  (which is a really good thing!)  I would highly recommend this wonderful chair to anyone considering it!  Enjoy!",1
Need to dispose of adult diapers on a regular basis.  These make the task much easier.  And ordering them on Amazon with Prime delivery makes acquiring refills a breeze.,1
"I have some other brands and theese have to be the easiest to reuse, and you can use whatever insert you want.",1
"My baby took to this product immediately! We are miserable if we leave home without it - it has become an absolute necessity! The only thing is the seam came apart a little and the stuffing shows on the nose, the part he gums/sucks the most. So we bought a back up! :)",1
I love it!,1
This is great! I get lot's of mom's that ask me where I bought this little fan and in the desert heat where I live my baby really needs this! I'll use it in the car too so she get's an extra breeze in the back seat and it's soft foam blades wont hurt her when she tries to grab it,1
I love this bedding! It looks just like the pictures. I love the colors. I love the price I got it for on Amazon too. I havent washed it yet so I can't speak for the brown bleeding as others have stated may happen. The only down side is it only has one valance in the set... it would have been nice if it had 2! Can't wait to set up my lil guys nursery!,1
Prince Lionheart Ever-Fresh Replacement Pillows for Ultimate Wipes Warmer are perfect for our baby! Thanks a lot! I really like it!,1
Just what I wanted for my 2 yr old for practicing letters and numbers. She loves it and so does her older sister!,1
"Bought this product for use with my second child not ever having experience with a sling. It makes running errands with a two year old and a newborn SO much easier. Instead of having to carry the giant carseat into the store or using a double stroller at the mall, I can just set him in the sling and still have both hands to shop freely. Not to mention he stays passed out every time he's in there!",1
The game is a good consempt but we changed it to jello and added them fo a dessert cubes for the baby shower.,0
Much quieter than the previous gates we've used. They do slide just a slight amount and rub on the wallpaper but otherwise keep our dogs contained!,1
I bought these to send to my daughter's daycare for mixing formula because they work to help control how much air she sucks in and are they not as complicated to assemble as the Dr. Brown bottles. The nipples are stiffer but she didn't seem to mind that.,1
"I purchased this for my grandson and he loves it! It is a great teething toy, and is one of his favorites!",1
I bought this as a gift for a family new addition: the parents and I love it. One day the baby will too; when she's old enough to appreciate it! Have recommended it to a couple of new mothers'-to-be.,1
Great stroller. It is compact and hold both kids with ease. It does not work well on rough terrain but I can overlook that since everything else is great.,1
"I think it's a good idea, but my daughter prefers Thomas underwear. I like that it's tight fitting around legs.",0
I love this stroller. The one hand collapse design is awesome and it's easy for me to lift it in the trunk. We also purchased the infant car seat attachment which works great for us. This stroller is also super stylish and I have plenty of space in the basket underneath. It's worth purchasing a parent console that attaches to the handle ( I bought a $10 one and it works like a charm). The decline future is awesome when baby wants to take a nap. I'm glad I bought it.,1
The curtains were just a pictured and matched the rest of the nursey bedding set perfectly.They arrive when promised.,1
Love this wide material soft baby gates that we are using to keep my dogs in the living room.  Very easy to use and very attractive.,1
My son was breastfed but had to take a bottle at daycare.  He took well to the Born Free bottles.  The Born Free training cup was an easy transtition for him.  We tried five different training cups and this was the only one he took to for quite some time.,1
"I got this pump at my shower and I regret not having looked around for a better pump. My son gained  over 2 lbs in two weeks so I know he's getting enough when he nurses, but I struggle at times to get ONE ounce, sometimes two if I'm lucky. Even if I take a hot shower first to encourage let down, still no luck. It's a piece of crap.",0
The unit is price fairly. Not the best made (the unit arrived with a nick or two) but its basic design and structure are satisfactory. This is a table for our grand daughters.The open shelves below the table are proving handy for storage.Assembly was not difficult.,1
pain to set up but works great and keeps my little one from falling out of bed!! I am very satisfied with my purchase :),1
"It is nicely designed and produced. Good materials, good details, baby friendly. I have nothing to complain about this part. The problem is, the baby bed is still about half feet lower than your bed. So you can not simply halfway get up and take the baby close to you. You must lift the baby  to cross the lower bar first before you hold him close to you. This is just impossible for me after the C-section. My belly could not give much strength. I was annoyed for quite a few days. And decided leave the baby on our bed and drove away the dad to sofa.I wonder why it has to be lower for half feet. May be required by the regulation? Sometimes I feel the baby products have too much safe concern and sacrifice too much convenience. The life now is safer but unhappier.",0
"I love to have order and organization so this product is right up my alley. Along with the breastmilk bags, I feel so organized with this product. It keeps the bags in order, upright, and it also squeezes the bag so they freeze nice and thin. Love it!",1
I love these monitors and my son loves that i can talk to him and not be in the same room it soothes him just to hear my voice and sometimes he will go back to sleep not evening having to see me,1
Growing up I was used to playing with wooden building blocks. I discovered these foam building blocks on amazon and was pleasantly surprised! The blocks come in a variety of colors and are not harmful to kids. Kids can be naughty sometimes and throw building blocks at each other; with these foam blocks they aren't as harmful when being thrown. A very educational item and will buy same brand again!,1
"These did not work out for me.  my kitchen table has a deep top to it and the chairs are deep as well.the kids legs are too tight under the table when I push them in. they are 2 years old and pretty tall but I was still hoping to use them.  I think these seats would work well with a thin table and small chairs. the buckle would not fit around the chairs either.  otherwise they would have been great.  the twins say """"too tight"""". just something to think about because I certainly did not think about the type of table I have.",0
"This is the best bottle what i have trying with my babyHe is 5 months now and we have trying a lot brands (Avent, Dr Brown, Gerber and more)Never leaks so easy to used dishwaher safe and easy to baby start to learning hold a bottle !!",1
"After unsuccessfully nursing my three boys due to engorgement and infection, I researched options to help for a successful attempt with my new little girl. I ordered these right after her delivery and was thrilled with the product! We're three weeks into nursing now and I've never been so comfortable doing it. I'm grateful and would definitely recommend to others.",1
"My son is a breastfed baby and I luckily got 12 weeks off work to stay home with him. I didn't introduce the bottle until week 9-10 and he hated it. We tried Avent, since that is the same as my pump, and he gags on them. I tried First Years Soothies, Playtex Vent-air, Parents Choice and Nuk. 2 weeks at daycare with just the Nuk bottle since that is all he'd kind of suck on (1-2oz) while I was working, I bought the Mam bottles. I figured it couldn't hurt. He took right to them. I got home from work, put 3 oz in the bottle and he ate all of it in about 5 minutes. Days at daycare are sooo much more stress free!!! My husband laughed at me because I was so excited about this bottle. He doesn't understand how stressed I've been knowing that he's only eating 1-2oz in the 8 hours I'm away. I'm so relieved I bought this bottle and I feel bad for thinking that if I stick to the Nuk bottle, he'll eventually suck on it. I just think he had a hard time latching on to the others. Anyway, I highly recommend this bottle!!",1
"I bought this for my grandson, but it wasn't what I expected.  I tried to use it, but he would not even try it-he did not like it at all. I can not recommend it, but it may be great for someone elses baby.",0
"These plates are well made, they do not slip on the tray. So far we eat only purees but these will be big enough for a while.",1
"This was my second purchase of this walk-thru gate. It is by far the best I have purchased.  Sturdy, easy to open, safe for me to walk through and very nice looking.  You can't go wrong with this gate.",1
"I did not like it  jejeje  is a hole down and the bag will hold some milk, hmmm I wouldn't buy this again",0
"We bought this highchair 4 months ago. Great purchase. Its easy to use, super easy to clean, pattern and design looks great, infant insert is helpful, wheels are a big plus, and the chair seems comfortable for baby/toddler overall. We liked the grey color for being gender neutral for future babies. Only thing I have experienced that is a drawback is that when our little one is not being so patient waiting for mom, she sometimes does this planking thing where she goes board straight (yay for the start of tantrums!) and will pop the tray loose, especially if you put it in a snug position. But, when they are strapped in, there is no worries of her falling out. I keep the tray a little farther away now and that seems to keep it from popping loose most of the time. Overall though, we love it.",1
"Unfortunately I have to agree with most of the other reviewers...I had received this as a gift (having had no idea there was such a product) and was very excited to use it.  However, the sound quality is terrible and the comment below about getting more bang for your buck with a cheap boombox is absolutely correct.  I paid $20 for a small radio/CD player at Walmart with much better quality.I could live with the sound quality (I've gotten used to it), however, the batteries do not last for more than a few playings.  Its difficult to change the batteries when you do have to do it.  Also, there is something wrong with our volume knob, it gets ""static""(similar to the sound when you adjust a radio station) when we adjust the volume controls.  Sometimes there's no sound at all unless we press the volume knob down while it plays - but obviously I can't stand by the crib all day so that's a problem.They should come out with a model that has better sound quality and can be plugged in for power. While this player is better than nothing, it really should be a better product.",0
"The best stroller ever. Great smooth ride, easy to push even with my 4 year old sitting on the front. Was so excited to recieve it in 2 days thanks to amazon prime!",1
"This item is not airtight or leak proof. Good thing I tested it with water before I put my sauce in it.  Too tiny to put anything else, and since it is not leak proof, I don't know what else I can put in it. Maybe 3 pieces of grapes.",0
"These are great containers and the perfect size. They have 2 and 4 ounce markings on the side. The lids sometimes become stuck, but only when they are over-filled.",1
My son always wants a water bottle with him.  He absolutely loves this for carrying the bottle.  It seems well made and is a clever idea for kids.,1
"Right after i opened the box I was slightly concerned how small it was.. it looked like a doll bed! It is quite short and fairly low to the ground but once it was together I was pleased to see how well it fits the space I have. Amazon shipped amazingly fast, it was packaged  and was not damaged in any way. It was here the afternoon after I ordered it. I was able to get the crib put together on my own at 22 weeks pregnant in a little over an hour and I am not good at furniture building at all! It is a beautiful little crib and just about the right size to use as a bedside co-sleeper if you are so inclined. I am planning on purchasing a thicker mattress as the foam pad is not as thin or flimsy as I expected but if you press down you can feel the support springs which I do not think would be comfortable.  I am very happy with my purchase.",1
"We put this gate at the top of our stairs leading into the basement. It doubles as a gate for the baby and for the dog. It has hardware to mount it to the wall and was very easy to install. It swings easily both ways and the auto locking mechanism works great. It is adjustable in width, but we did not need it to expand very far. Quality of gate is good as well.",1
"Only after using a pump for a week I got tired of holding and ordered this bra. It does the Job well.Good: does the job t is supposed to perfectly.Bad: this is more with the pump itself, I need to sit up straight and can't relax while pumping. If not, milk starts dripping on my skin. I wish the bra was deigned so that it can overcome that.",1
"This is the second one I've gotten for my boys so I'm pretty familiar with it. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because of the detachable tray (the blue one). While I think it's a great idea for fast cleaning, it's almost impossible to get them to keep it on and my 18 month old has pinched his fingers more than once while playing with it. So I always end up tossing it in the trash.",1
My wife ordered this and I was skeptical but its easy to install and helps organizes a baby closet. Highly recommended.,1
Plate and bowl are good but the fork and spoon are cumbersome for little hands.  Otherwise it is a good and cute set.,0
"I'm on my second unit in six months.  The first displayed an incorrect error message.  Avent replaced it.  Very shortly after receiving, the second unit just stopped working, despite being used according to directions.  When calling Avent Philips the second time, the advice given was to descale for 48 - 72 hours, changing the solution every six hours.  I find this to be impractical, and frankly ridiculous, advice for anyone, let alone a product for a household with a baby (or babies).  So, now I am following this advice so that I can call Avent back and assume that I will have another replacement unit sent to me, though I will request a simple refund.  In the meantime, I've gone back to using the Medela microwave bags for sterilizing items when needed.Bottom line: When this works, it is great and I love the convenience.  Unfortunately, the replacement hassle definitely outweighs the convenience, so I do not recommend purchasing this unit.",0
"This was a lifesaver with a newborn baby.  She spent most of her time in here, when she was not being held.  Now that she is 4 months old, she prefers the my little snugabunny swing.",1
"It is a very cute napper and the converting from napper to a bouncer is easy to manage. It is larger and occupies more space than what I've expected, and it looks a bit large for a newborn to sleep on but it's not a huge issue.",1
"Lady Adelynn loved it! It is so darn cute and easy for a 9 month old to hold. I would never spend that much for a toothbrush for myself but did not hesitate buying it for the granddaughter. Also, a great teething toy!",1
"Very well designed, good value, and the mom to be was very pleased with her gift. I would recommend this to friends.",1
"We loved our lifefactory glass bottles so I bought these to prolong their use. These are horrible. If they're on correctly, then my son had a hard time getting the liquid to come out. When we loosened it so he could drink, it spilled all over the place.I hope they're able to improve the design on this because we truly loved our bottles.",0
LOVE that it's wind and weather resistant. It fits my Bugaboo Chamealean perfectly and looks a lot better than the Infant Bundleme we had last year.,1
"This item is very cute. I bought it for my 2 year old son, and this will probably fit him for another 1-2 years. He is very tall for his age as well, always in the 90-95 percentile. The only negative I found with this is that the item is much cheaper now than when I bought it, which ticks me off a bit. It's about 50% off what I paid for it, and I shopped around first.",1
"In my baby's first few months, he had terrible acid and would wake up choking (even if we kept him up at an angle). Milk and/or saliva would come out of his nose and he had this panicked look on his face - it was terrible.  We kept the bulb syringes in every part of the house and he absolutely hated them and I wasn't convinced that they worked that well because he had a hard time catching his breath and they seemed to be irritating his very tiny nasal passages.I'm not sure how I even came across this item, but I read something about battery-powered aspirators so I bought one of those first. It worked ok, better than the bulb syringe, but while researching, I came across the Nosefrida. I read the reviews from other moms and decided to give it a whirl.Thank God!  Although he hates it maybe slightly less than the bulb syringe, this got all of the congestion out quickly and didn't irritate his nasal passages because it doesn't go up his nose. It just sits at the base of his nostrils.  I didn't have to keep using it like I did the bulb, and I also used the saline nasal spray to loosen it up first.  Whoever invented this is a genius. This might be one of my favorite baby products so far.  I only use the bulb now if I have to suction out his mouth, but you can pretty much use this one-handed, holding it like a pencil to the baby's nostril while you put the other end in your mouth like a whistle.  This makes it user-friendly if your baby squirms a lot like mine does.P.S. Don't forget to put the filter in there if you take it out to clean it.  Thankfully, the tube is so long that you likely won't suck it up far enough for any mucous to get into your mouth...",1
"This is a great product, but the battery life isn't high if you want to hear detailed audio, instead of bursts of audio.  I prefer to be able to hear my baby's breathing at night, which is only available in the constant transmission mode, which drains the battery quickly.  The 8 hour battery life  assumes 25% transmission, so the battery life would sensibly yield about 2 hours.We had a SCD 589, which has some great features beyond these, but you cannot get a second parent unit or a second charging base.  As such, we switched to these units.",1
This stroller is excellent. My wife bought this -- at first I wasn't sure if this would work for me because it was an umbrella stroller and with me being a tall man -- I didn't want a stroller that would give me back pain. It didn't! It was at a great height and also great comfort at the handles.,1
"nice design, cute ( I got white), simple, & does what it should. Def would recommend. 4 stars because the top thing got stock & I cannot remove it, LOL",1
"Bought this as a gift for our daughter.  It went together very easy, and it looks beautiful and of good quality.",1
"My daughter had terrible reflux and wouldn't sleep in anything else for the first 6 1/2 months of her life!  Most reflux babies hate lying flat on their back b/c it hurts.  This was the perfect incline and it was so warm and snuggly for her!  She truly loved it!  And I loved it b/c she slept better in this than anywhere else.  I have read the other reviews about the motor being loud, but truly everyone is different in their tolerance.  It really didn't bother me and honestly...it's not THAT loud!  I think it's worth it if my child is happy.....price or noise!!!!  Who cares!",1
"We use to swear by the snack trap.  I had two left over from my five year old daughter that I was using with my younger daughter, unfortunately we lost both of them.  I bought a new pack of 3 and the new lids are tough and sharp.  My daughter couldn't get the snack out without hurting her hand (the lid also hurt my hand).  They have changed the material of the lids, I am totally bummed!  I returned the pack for a refund.",0
"We are commited babywearers and have a number of slings / front carriers. I (Dad) use this one a lot because it looks the least crunchy-granola-ish of all the slings.It could really use a wider strap or some shoulder padding, and has given me some aches after wearing for a few hours, but DD is very happy in it and always goes right to sleep. I actually like the drawstrings, personally, because I can snug her up in a cradle hold with just her face exposed, sort of like wearing a hoody, if that makes sense. The bottom is padded, which provides great support for newborns.By the pictures you might guess the material is Gore-Tex or the like but it's actually a thick cotton, which does get a bit hot in the summer, if outside on a hot day.Overall, I like this one, and for the price it's a good addition to our arsenal of carriers, or as I call them ""Colic Remediation Devices"". People always comment on it and I get to be the cool Dad at Target or the mall.",1
I can see why the general size of these is larger but this one is the perfect size because we can roll it around the house through standard size doorways without breaking it down.,1
"The gate did not fit into the entrance of our staircase and although the website of the manufacturer claims that there are extensions, none could be found on the site.Even though I could not complete the installation, the product itself did not inspire much confidence that it was going to withstand what we demanded of it, namely keeping our toddler daughter from falling down the stairs.In addition, the pieces used to put together the gate were of poor quality and tolerance.  One only wishes that the manufacturers of such products understood that when dealing with safety, short-cuts in quality should never be tolerated.",0
"I love this booster - how easy it is to clean, how stable it is attached to the chair, it is a great overall booster seat for my two year old.",1
"My daughter loves this elephant towel.  Holding up in good condition so far (only had it a few months) but she enjoys getting out of the tub and being an elephant every time!  Would definitely purchase again!  (And did, purchased the bear too!)",1
"I bought this stroller because I wanted something bigger than an umbrella stroller, but not huge and bulky. On that it delivers. It folds up pretty compactly. It was easy to assemble and is easy to fold and unfold. The seat has two positions, reclined and sitting upright. Both are too extreme, I wish there was an inbetween position. The other thing that is annoying is that when the seat is upright, the sun shade doesn't keep the sun off the baby. I like the three point harness. The basket underneath is huge and easy to access.Edited to add: After a few weeks of use, I decided that the sunshade issue combined with the poor seat recline options, really made this stroller unusable for walks. I also noticed that the seat lacks support and my 8 month old spent most of the walk slouched, sliding or slumped in the seat when it was recline. I opted to sell this stroller and purchase a larger stroller.",1
"I love this book. I'm not very good at writing, so the fact that the book gives me lots of things to write about helps. There are a lot of different categories that your child will love reading about when she's older, and many different photo opportunities. Some of the different photos include family photos, sonogram, baby showers, hospital picture of baby, birth announcement, and pictures for each month. I enjoyed finding pictures to put in the different categories. I used some scrapbooking stickers to add finishing touches to the photos. They went perfectly! One category I think it should have but doesn't is ""adventures in dining."" I haven't gotten to that point yet (solid foods I mean, I do feed my baby), but I look forward to it and know there will be great stories and photo ops. This can be added to the ""funny stories and sweet memories"" section at the back.As someone else said, the bow on the front fell off-actually I never saw it, but I can add my own eventually. Not worth lowering the stars for!",1
"My son and I are very happy with this mobile!  The knitted elephants are colorful and bright (although a tad lighter than pictured here) and captivating enough to entertain him.I find the musical crank operation rather refreshing--as a new mom with several toys for her baby that DO require batteries, it is nice that one doesn't.  One less thing to get batteries for that will simply run out!Worth the money!",1
"This toy is just okay.  I may feel differently when my baby gets a little bit older, but right now, she doesn't stay in it for longer than 10 minutes or so.  She's 4 months old right now.  She can't really sit upright so she ends up leaning forward a little bit.Update (3/13/06) She really likes it now--she will stay in it long enough for me to give the kitchen floor a good wash.  She has tried all the toys, and is still learning how to play with some of them.  But she seems to have a lot of fun trying!  This product definitely deserves 4 stars!",0
"Well made, soft & durable! It holds up to use & washing perfectly with no sign of wear yet. The sage color is vibrant & beautiful.",1
"These bottles are the best at reducing air swallowed by the baby - unless you want to use those bottles with disposable liners. Seeing as I don't like to use anything ""disposable"" (as if we didn't create enough trash already!) these are the best choice.If your baby doesn't have huge problems with acid reflux, doesn't spit up a lot, and generally seems fine with feeding, and you'd like to reduce the parts to clean a little, you may also considerPlaytex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 6 Ounce. We use both, and both have survived 2 kids so far.*To clarify: Technically the VentAire bottles have the same number of parts. But since you can pre-build the bottles it seems like less hassle when you actually fill them. They also take a little less space. That being said - the child has to suck hard to suck air into the bottle and avoid swallowing air. If they instead open their mouth to let air in through the nipple the design is negated. Dr Brown's are still the best.",1
"We purchased this crib in 2009 as foster parents. We wanted a crib we could stow away in case we were placed with an older child. We were placed with a 22 month old who was able to use this crib until he was about 28 months old at which time he was able to climb out on his own and had to move into another bed. We were later placed with a 4 month old who was able to use the crib for about 6 months before the crib began to completely fall apart. The wooden slats began to separate from the main structure of the crib. There does not seem to be a safe way to fix it.This crib seems to be great for short term or occasional use, but I would not recommend it as the primary bed for your infant or toddler.",0
"My grandson loves this toy - he lays in bed and laughs and coos with it regularly. Anything that involves a child actively where he is watching the light changes, following the movement and talking to himself in the mirror is a good toy.",1
These are the best training pants by far.  Beautiful.  Comfortable.  They fit.  They hold more than just accidents.  Just don't buy these from Online Care Solutions.,1
I didn't realize that these are rather small. I bought them when I travelled internationally with my 6 month old and he was  rather big for them. So ended up only being under his bum as opposed to his whole body which I would have liked,1
I searched high and low for a first year calendar and settled on this one based on the reviews.  I am so happy that I did.  Perfect for jotting down quick memories throughout the month and remembering dates of baby's &#34;firsts&#34;.  Will be fun to look back on.  Also has spots for personalization and pictures.,1
"My mom has collected S&P; shakers since the 1950s! She had never seen these B4, she thinks they they were a great gift from a loving son.As usual, they were packaged well and arrived very quicklywould recommend them.",1
"We have this at grandma's house as a hand me down. It's cute and lots of fun, but I don't like the saucer shaped base. It keeps tilting side to side which can be uncomfortable for baby. I prefer the jumperoo style that has open access to a flat floor surface. The flat floor seems safer for him to jump in too.If you'd like a list of what to put on your baby registry, visit the website AllMomsArePerfect.com and look under baby gear essentials. You'll find a baby carrier guide, stroller shopping and crib buying guide, and what to expect during delivery, recovery, and how to get sleep after baby comes along.",0
"I'm glad I purchased the pillow, but its definitely not worth what you pay for it.  I've been using the pillow for about a month now and the head part of the pillow is starting to become really uncomfortable.  I think I'm just used to being able to sleep in whatever position I want and now I'm limited.  Do not waste money on a cover.  They are scratchy (I purchased the jersey knit cover that was supposed to be t-shirt soft).  I ended up using a pillow case over the head portion because the cover was so scratchy.",1
"I wasnt ready to put my 3yr old in a booster seat, but he was almost to outgrow the 40lb weight limit on his other carseat.  The Regent is perfect for him!  It was easy to install, and fits in our minivan great!  And this seat will fit him for years to come.  I'd definitely recommend this seat to a friend.",1
"We only use AVENT bottles in our home. I really like them, except that they leak! I have read every review possible attempting to find the secret to prevent leaking (I have yet to find a solution). That being said, I will absolutely use them with any additional children I have.Reasons I like AVENT bottles:- Easy to clean. I've hand washed them and used the dishwasher - depending on the space in my dishwasher. The bottles are perfectly safe in the dishwasher, they do tend to become slightly discolored (a light tan-brown). I'm fairly certain that the instructions even say that this happens.- Wide mouth. I like that when pouring formula into the bottle it is wide enough to accommodate the scoop or formula dispenser. I've been told that many other brands are not easy to use with formula because the mouth is very narrow causing a lot of formula to spill.- Price. These bottles are not the cheapest but are much better priced than many other popular brands. I feel as though they are priced in the middle.- Interchangeable parts.  I like that I can get these bottles and use them with the sippy handles and sippy spouts to turn them into sippy cups.  I also used these for milk/formula storage with the storage disks (which go in the place of the nipple).  One bottle can be so many different things for just a small additional price.CONS:- Again, these bottles DO leak. I've both put the bottles together when wet and dry and have noticed no difference. Additionally, I've even mixed the formula and poured into this bottle and it still leaked. I like these bottles for so many other reasons so the leaking isn't a deal-breaker (also, my baby tends to make a huge mess anyway so leaking doesn't really matter).UPDATE:- After writing this review I called Philips AVENT about any additional suggestions for stopping the bottle from leaking.  While their customer service was excellent they didn't give me any additional suggestions.  I also did more internet research and found an interesting solution that I hadn't found before.  Basically it just tells you to align two (2) of the three (3) air valves on the nipple with two (2) of the four (4) plastic fins on the nipple ring.  I tried this and with the bottles I've used this technique they haven't leaked!  This takes a little bit of effort to do but solves the leaking problem.",1
My little one loves this toy.,1
"Doesn't hold right, seems like its missing something, moves at every turn, I hate it! And just so difficult to put my son in everytime we get in the car..",0
"My baby is 5 months old and LOVES this toy! However, with these kind of toys, I think it really depends on the baby to decipher which toy is really the ""best"". I took my baby to babies r us and she ""picked"" this one. She could really care less about the rest, which either seemed to bore her (Exersaucer Mega) or annoy her (Smart Steps- the mobile hanging down hit her on the head and was in the way, not fun).As I am a mother who feels guilty letting toys ""babysit"" your child, I feel like this toy at least offers some great qualities which enhance my baby's motor skills and speech. I worked with an Occupational Therapist for a couple of years, and many of the items on the play center are items we used at the facility to enhance motor skills. I take her out of it after 15-20 minutes because some doctors believe these things can damage their spine/hips if you leave them in for too long, and she cries when I remove her.I also love how it is interactive. The puppet allows great bonding between parent/child as well as the animal sound device. I dance when she presses on the song and it encourages her to do so more.This was incredibly easy to assemble. Took me about 5 minutes and comes apart easily to store. Seems very secure for child and doesn't appear to have any parts that could harm my baby (ie: where she could get fingers stuck). I absolutely love this playcenter and would highly recommend it to any mother looking for a little break without feeling guilty!",1
"I purchased this for someone who recently had a baby. I really like Woodours products for their quality and educational value. This bear has a cute silly face and is small enough for a little kid to hold with his/her own grip. The different patches of fabrics used on this bear are nice, too. Pull on the fish and it plays a song when it retracts back to the bear. I wish it had a soft body, but I guess in order to contain all the mechanisms for the music box, it needed a hard casing.",1
We love these bottles. The glass makes feeding more sanitary! That is the biggest plus to these bottles. Our daughter is 8 months and it allows us to feed her 8 or 9oz now that she is demanding more formula. They are very easy to clean and do not cause her to need to be burped. The flow is a little faster than we have been used to with Dr. Browns or with Dr. Andrew Wiel. They are portable and come with lids and a stopper for being able to pre-fill nursery water prior to being on the go.,1
My 3 and a half month old son looked awesome in this! It was such great quality too!! We got so may compliments on this unique costume.  He was so happy and cozy in it.  I would highly reccommend this to anyone especially in New England b/c it keeps the baby warm.  ADORABLE,1
"This little thing just makes me smile when we use it. There were some reviews that said that the projections were fuzzy, and I guess it is a matter of perspective. Yes, they are not 1080p but they do pretty well on your average height ceiling (even with popcorn) or wall. The sounds are pretty good. The quality is average to good and they are not annoying. The little ocean and water sounds are pretty good too.A couple of things, if it falls asleep on you after you run it, and it's pitch black or very dark in the room, be careful how you pick it back up. I ended up setting it back off accidentally and scared the crap out of myself.Only other note, it would be nice to have more control over the time it runs but hey, its great for what you pay for and Fischer Price quality (meaning great!).",1
"Now that I am going back to work, and my baby has to use the bottle, this sterilizer is great! Not only did I use it to sterilize my baby's bottles, nipples, pacifiers...but I also use this to for sterilizing parts of my breast pump. This is definitely better than the microwave sterilizer. It automatically shuts off when it's done, no need to worry once you switch in on. It's like having a separte dishwasher for your baby.",1
Great seat. Comfortable and fits over an elongated bowl. Allows your child to sit in so they cannot wiggle off. I have a girl but have older boys and this would block you from getting streamed.,1
"My daughter-in-law received one of these for a baby shower gift, when the baby arrived, it was invaluable but more were needed!!! The material is so soft, the wrapping easy to perform for a new mother, and the baby looks very cute!Would strongly recommend- a little pricey but well worth it!",1
Price and safety are great.  I bought it for my 12 month old who now must stay rear facing until he is two.  His feet are altready touching the back of the seat.  He may have to cross his legs by age 2.,0
This item is easy to install and comes with all the neccessary hardware. A bit of advice if you have a lot of stuffed animals like we do:  Make sure you stretch it out wide and mount it a little high as there is a lot of flex (which I like so it can hold more).  Notice in the picture how it sags down quite a bit.,1
"It could've been a malfunction for someone who made a comment on the battery life, because My battery has lasted over 3 years. It is very accurate and I love that you can put all the pieces away so they never get misplaced. Great size and weight for diaper bag. One of the products I have that I made great use of and still works like a charm.",1
"I recently bought these for my kids to try with their first baby. Although these are not his size yet I&#8217;ve been taking a 'soft sell&#8217; approach on the plusses of cloth over disposables. That said, I used the Nappies for covering a tiny butted baby on his changing table, used them as a burp cloth, used them as a changing pad, soaked them in warm water and covered his hurting tummy. There is no disposable that can do all that as well as diaper a baby! My kids have the all in one cloth as well but for any new mom or dad, a package of these diapers is a must for all the reasons (and ways) I&#8217;ve used them (and now the kids do as well!).",1
"My son hates and I mean hates getting his hair washed. This started when he was 2 years old. He use to love it. We've tried dumping water over his head to get it over with, have him sit on my lap and I lean his head in the bathtub and wash his hair while he looks up, and all sorts of tricks. He cries and cries. We thought it may have been the shampoo and switched countless times. Well, I finally went on a blog and got some advise about a shower visor so I bought this one based on its reviews. We first allowed my son to play with the visor and then put him in a bath tub while he was in a good mood and not so tired. We played with bubbles then I used a wet wash cloth to get his hair wet enough to shampoo. Then we tried to get this on his head and he screamed like a banshee. I had to have my husband hold his arms while I quickly put this on his head and dump water to rinse. It was quick and effective. The trick is to get him to actually wear this visor without screaming. So the product itself is effective.",1
"Fit for a princess's room. We had to stuff it a lot to make it look full and fluffy, but it's beautiful.",1
Very good item easy to install. But a little smell need to keep away for a few weeks to let the smell gone,1
"I purchased this cup a few months ago for my baby girl, but just recently started using it more.GOOD:- Liquid flows pretty easily (WAY better than the flip straw cup - I tried them out myself).- Easy to clean.- Easy to grip.- Straw end stays ""in"" the liquid longer, even when there's not much liquid left, which was a problem I was encountering with some other cups.""FLAW"":- It may be spill-proof, but not baby-proof.  My 1-yr old has figured out how to ""work the mechanism"" by pressing on the spout to make water flow out, not really Munchkin's fault. :-P",1
"I love the Halo sleepsacks. This is not a swaddle sack, so don't get confused! The swaddle sacks were pretty worthless for my Houdini baby, but once we broke him of the swaddle I started using these Halo wearable blanket sacks. They are the perfect weight for cooler nights, and they hold up through many washes and wears.",1
Brilliant product. Very easy and quick to install. Would definitely recommend this product. Very reasonably priced compared to other options.,1
"IT'S VERY SMALL, FOR ME IT'S DONT A GOOD TOY.. . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . .. . . . ..",0
Do not recommend this product at all.  Very thin liners and not worth the money even though it seemed reasonable at the time.,0
It looks just like the picture I received everything. The colors are bright and it's a very nice size bag,1
"Great product - sturdy and has a lot of different activities to keep my grandson busy.  I like that there are different sides to it, so when they turn, it is like having a new set of toys!",1
"I absolutely LOVE this product! It was a little hard to install in my car, but that's because of the shape of the seats. My owners manual for my car suggested the center for forward facing and it fit perfectly. My daughter absolutely loves this seat. The reason I got it was because she is constantly falling asleep, and the last car seat I had did not support her head well. She can now sleep comfortably without her head falling forward. I would definitely recommend this product! I bought it at babies r us for $150. Well worth the money :)",1
"this toy/lamp is so popular with the kid's, amazing waves on walls, excellent item - fast service.  There is nothing out there like this, would recommend as a gift for someone, because it is so unusual, they will love it.",1
I just bought a new car and this one has my toddler sitting a bit closer than my last car and his feet refuse to leave the back of my seat the whole time we are in the car.  I wanted something durable and simple and this product was perfect.  It was super easy to attach to my seat and so easy to clean.  Highly recommended.,1
My daughter has slept on this mattress for 15 months. It fits our Davinci Emily crib great and we have not noticed any problems with sagging or tearing. She slept on the infant side until about a year old and now is on the toddler side. The mattress is a material that will easily wipe clean but we have a protector pad on it also. When changing the crib sheet I have no problem lifting it out of the crib myself and still can at 21 weeks pregnant.  I will be buying the same crib and mattress for #2 arriving this summer. I would recommend this mattress.,1
"This mobile is built very well. The parts that hang down are made out of a thick cardboard stock and the designs are eye catching. The best part about this is it is portable and designed to be moved around as you need it. The clip is strong and very easy to use to attach it to the top of a car seat carry handle, stroller, etc.For the price, it's pretty nifty.",1
"My sister had Mortimer the Moose for her boys, and they loved it so much that it became her go-to gift for parents of newborns. I've started doing the same, buying Mortimer or other toys from this series as gifts for co-workers and friends.  The results are that this toy usually becomes a favorite, great for distracting or cheering a fussy baby!  One friend just reported that her 6 month old daughter gets &#34;so excited&#34; when she sees the toy, that they have to keep it hidden away when not in use.Something about the combination of textures and colors is absolute magic for babies.",1
got this for my daughter when she had her daughter and she said that was the best thing I could have gotten her it is handy and loves the automatic button for on and off when bottle is out of all the things I got her for the baby she loves this the best keeps it in her car never takes it out so she has it when needed works when her elec. when off and she could go out and still warm the bottle up only takes a few min. loves its loves it,1
love it my son loves it also. I did find it cheaper at Walmart after I got it from you.,1
If you think you are sleep deprived now just wait until you get this monitor.  It has great features but it clicks constantly.  You are up listening to the sound of the monitor rather than the sound of your baby crying.  I called Fisher Price and they said that this monitor makes a clicking noise because of the transmission of all the features.  There is no way to get rid of it.  It isn't worth the lack of sleep.,0
"I purchased this item and was satisfied with the quality, the ease of installation and I recommend this item to everyone.",1
These cups are great. They work well and are spill proof and they are so well priced that it's no big deal if you loose one or two.,1
"This camera was purchased for my Motorola MBP36 Baby Monitor which only comes with one camera. I needed a second camera for a new baby. Previous to purchasing the Motorola MBP36, I had used baby monitors from Levana, Lorex, MobiCam, Samsung, and Summer Infant (my search for the perfect one was a little excessive). This Motorola is one of the better ones I've used.The setup was super-easy, and it worked flawlessly. It's the exact same camera that comes with the MBP36 set, so it swivels all around - tilts, pans and zooms nicely as advertised. It can be placed on a nightstand, and it can be mounted to the wall. I have both cameras mounted to the wall, about 7-8 feet away from the crib. The night vision is excellent. If you have the MBP36 unit with camera, you know exactly what you are getting. I was pretty happy with the purchase.About a month into using the unit it started to slowly lose the night vision feature. At first it was barely noticeable so I dismissed it; but another month in, it became pretty obvious that night vision was failing. Night vision was still working on the original camera (after months of use), but not on this additional camera (only about a month use). I swapped the two cameras between the rooms and tested them to confirm, and verified that night vision was gone on the second camera only. I probably got a defective unit.As night vision is one of the key features I needed, this camera became very inconvenient...it basically functioned only as an audio monitor for the second room at night.Thankfully, because I ordered from Amazon and this camera falls under the baby products 365-day return policy, Amazon replaced it at no charge. Order from Amazon if you want the peace of mind of a 365-day return guarantee. If you want 20% off the retail price, buy with a coupon from BBB, if there is one near you. I believe BBB has a good return policy as well.I gave it 4-stars because the replacement is working well. I assume that the first camera I received was defective. If this replacement camera fails also, I will write an update to this review and revise the rating.",1
"If I knew the seller was going to drop ship this item from a major bed and bath retailer, I would have gone straight to the source and saved the 100% markup.  Remember, Amazon isn't always the best price around!Four stars for a quality item.",1
"These plates are amazing.  First, they are made from Potatoes!!  Almost all plates/cups/utensils found on store shelves today are made of plastic.  Dont get me wrong, I do appreciate plastic and I use it on a daily basis.  However, it is amazing that there is a way to create children's products from a biodegradable, safe, efficient, and all natural source.  It makes me feel better knowing my kids are eating off a plate that is not leaching any chemicals into their food.  I also love that this product will not just sit in the landfill for hundreds of years, but will biodegrade faster than other plastic plates. So, these products by Spuds are not only good for my kids..but good for the environment...I LOVE that!Now, onto the plate itself.  I love the design.  It is perfect for my one year old who is starting to eat a wider variety of solid foods.  Each section is just the right size to put a little bit of food into.  A diced strawberry in one section, some applesauce in another, a few puffs in another, a chopped up nugget in another, and some yogurt drops in the last section.  However, each section is very small.  While this plate is perfect for an infant or younger toddler, it is not the ideal plate for an older toddler or child.  It simply does not hold a lot of food. I often have to refill some of the sections because even he can eat more than this plate will hold.  However, I think the size is perfect for younger kids who just dont need a huge plate, or perhaps for an older child who just wants a snack. I love that there are five sections to put different food in.  My one year old loves choosing which food to eat first.Another nice feature of this plate is that the sides rest flat against the table so it is not very easy for a child to pick it up and throw it.  However, it is not impossible, and my son is very capable of finding a way to lift it up.  However, it is a nice design to help prevent little fingers from grabbing the plate and throwing it, or dumping it on their head.Something that does not bother me, but might bother some people is that the plate stains if certain foods are left on the plate for a while.  Due to the nature of the product, I believe this plate is made from a slightly porous and softer material that traditional plastic. Because of this, some food might leave small stains on the plate.  I am guessing that if the plate is rinsed after each meal, this will not be an issue.  I left some pasta on the plate overnight, and even after washing it in the dishwasher, some red stains remained.  They do seem to be fading overtime after each time it is washed in the dish washer.The plate seems to be very durable, and looks as good as new even after almost a month of use.  I wash mine in the dishwasher after each use, and all three of my plates are holding up well.  I wasn't sure how it would do since it is made out of a potato product, but it looks great, has little to no warping or discoloration, and it still an awesome product.Overall I love these plates (and the whole Spud product line).  I love the material, and I feel safe using it.  They are absolutely perfect for my one year old, and I use them almost everyday.",1
"I love this brand and actually prefer over the more popular A&A brand. The print is so charming. We use this blanket for everything - swaddling, covering the car seat on walks, as a barrier to be on the ground under baby - you name it, this blanket is perfect!",1
"Nice lightweight travel system, easy to collapse and unfold for putting in the car. Did many researchs on strollers and car seats and this one suited us the best.",1
"I bought this for my newborn daughter to keep her warm through the winter months. The blanket is as shown, very bright in color, soft, and thick. It holds up well in the washer although there seem to be some kind of threads inside of the blanket that bunch it up a bit and the blanket has to be pulled out flat after being in the the dryer. This doesn't effect the appearance of it after you straighten it out though and has lasted through 10+ washings without noticeable fading or loss of softness.",1
"I have the Baby Jogger City Select Double Stroller.  Although, Im Sure the Stroller would fit inside the bag,  The bag is the same size of stroller.  I have seen a baby jogger carrying bag that holds the stroller but with a smaller bag.  How can there be such a discrepancy?",0
"This was a gift from my cousin.  I was looking for a medium to large diaper bag that was cute and functional, found this, and added it to my Amazon wish list.  This bag holds everything I need and I like that it isn't bulky like other diaper bags I have used.  I loved the style so much that I am making a polka dot car seat cover and burp cloths to match. ;) My only wish would be that it had more pockets, or were a little wider with more pockets on the inside, but over all I am delighted with this bag! Love it!",1
"Before having kids I was completely against these things, but not that my situation has changed so has my opinion.  I'm a single mother of two toddlers, and this product has become essential to us being able to function in public.  My son cuddles his lion when he's not wearing it as a backpack, and (since the leash is the tail) most of the time he doesn't even know that he's attached to Mama.  He's just happy to have the freedom to walk around on his own.",1
I love the drop-ins system.  I used them for my first daughter when I went back to work and my family who watched her loved the convenience of them. I am using them again for my DCP for my second daughter. There is less washing needed during the day as the bottle doesn't get dirty.  I have never had an issue with these and was happy to find them on Amazon!P.S. There is also a system you can buy to pump directly into the bottles.  It was cheap and saves a step!,1
"Cleaning my son with warm wipes was something I felt was important to his comfort.  Ever have someone put cold lotion on your back?  Yah.  So I buy the warmer that seemed to score highest on the ratings, which was not that many at the time.  It does its job of keeping the wipes warm and moist.  But it promises to not brown the bottom wipes.  And it does anyway.  I end up throwing out the bottom dozen wipes due to dryness and browning.  Personal preference; I would have chose another brand.",0
"Our daughter loved these cups...maybe a little too much!  Each time she was teething, she bit the spout area & ruined several cups.  We tried to find replacement spouts and ended up just buying a different kind of cup.",0
"I wish there was a 3.5 stars, but I guess four will do. I've only used this for bottles, but for the most part, it's a great item. My baby is formula fed, so we make formula in the evening to use the next day and store it in the fridge. It heats up perfectly in the time it takes to change my daughter's diaper, but it took us a good while and a few steam-burned hands to figure out the right timing. The bottles can overheat VERY quickly, and watch out for the steam it creates... it's REALLY hot. The water measurement IS NOT hard... you simply fill up the side cup to the line and pour it in when you're ready to heat. We don't use the cooler much anymore, but when we kept my daughter's bassinet next to my bed, it was great for a quick reach instead of running out to the kitchen.",1
Originally I was looking at getting this so that my husband and I could go to restaurants and be able to eat without holding a squirming baby. When I got it home we decided to set it up on our kitchen island which has been perfect! When we are cooking or eating at the island our son can play and still interact with us. It works just as great at the restaurants. There isn't a thing that I would change about it. It is compact for traveling to an from places and the ease of putting it on the table is great. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Well worth the money.,1
"For a China cheapie, these are not bad, at all! Decent quality, terrible-slow shipping. I know this is not really Amazon's fault since the diapers are coming straight from China. Something to blame on Alvababy. The only complaint I have is that the OS is so big even after you've adjusted the rise. At the smallest rise setting I don't believe it would fit an 8 lb. baby...they OS pocket diapers run a little big. And I never purchased a 'minky' diaper before, this set of 6 came with two minky diapers and I don't like it. Feels kinda weird and is soft, but not necessarily the minky soft I am familiar with.No leaks, no snaps broke off, no stink & no stain. Granted that is all based off of a well rounded wash cycle/routine but I think that these were good for the price and a good starter set for someone who would be interested in cloth diapering or would like to see how it works with their kids.",0
"These are the best utensils we found for our kids.  We got them at Walmart (the Parent's Choice brand, but says Nuby in the fine print) for under $4 for the same set.  The handles are easy to hold for left or right hands, and the scoop is just the right size.  The ""spork"" isn't sharp enough to actually poke most foods to use as a fork, but I suppose it's better that way for little ones.  We loved these, but I'd suggest looking for a cheaper one, either search for Nuby or look at Walmart.",1
Just what I needed for my gate. Installed easily and quickly. Works great on munchkin gates. Wish I would have found it sooner.,1
"We were given this stroller in the Glen Rock Design as a gift.  It is the same frame as the Malawi.  BEWARE!!!  IT UNEXPECTADEDLY collapsed with our 27-day-old baby girl in it.  She was thrown head first onto the pavement and suffered a fractured skull and bleeding on her brain.  She was transported by ambulance to Primary Children's Medical Center in SLC, Utah.  She luckily did not require surgery and seems to be recovering well.We have been working with Baby Trend and they agreed to pay our medical costs and said that they know why the stroller collapses, but will NOT recall it.  If you don't turn the wheels backwards before collapsing the stroller to put it in a trunk, the frame will bend, and from then on it can collapse without warning.  They are not issuing a safety notice or anything, so BEWARE!!!!  I can't believe it; does a child have to die?We are taking our story to the news to make sure that others DON'T have a similar thing happen.  Be careful please!  I have relived watching my daughter land headfirst on the pavement countless times in my mind.  It took us ten years to get her here and we feel blessed that she didn't suffer anything worse than she did.  But, I don't want others to go through this.UPDATE*****  CPSC (Consumer Product Safety Commision) is looking at this stroller for a RECALL.  You can view our news story at [...]",0
"My daughter is 6 months old and hasn't quite mastered rolling over and NEEDS to be swaddled to sleep. I tried unswaddling her one night and it lasted all of 30 minutes. It has been a must have for naps and night time. I only purchased one since she is on the verge of rolling over both ways, but if she was younger, I would have purchased more than one as a backup for spit up, diaper leaks,etc. I am a Miracle Blanket lover, but she was always getting out of that by 4 months, which is the maximum age for that. I decided to give the woombie a try and it has been great.The only con is that baby's don't have long necks the neck opening should either be a bit larger or adjustable for big baby's. I still use and love it and it doesn't seem to bother he. It just makes me wonder if I would be comfortable if I had something wrapped around my neck like that. I also don't want to be swaddled, though! :) Baby approved.",1
"This toy was hard to put together, because it was poorly manufactured.  The plastic slots weren't properly punched so I had to jam, force, slam, and use a rubber mallet to get some of the pieces in place.  The safety warning labels are poorly placed and scratched my kid.  Putting it together was infuriating, and my baby doesn't really like it.  Not worth $70 and I will not purchase Baby Einstein products in the future.",0
"I have a mixed opinion of this. To start with how well it works. My daughter took to it very well, in fact a little too well, she will not sit on anything else besides this. She became ""potty trained"" pretty quickly, so in that I was pleased. However, I was not aware that my daughter would be allergic to the seat, either the die in the seat or what the seat was made of. Either way, she developed hives all over her bottom, (circling her bottom where the seat touches). These soon developed into scabs that are now horrific to look at. Needless to say, we are throwing it out, and most likely going to have to start all over with the potty training. So as I said, it works great, but be cautious, and possibly make sure your child does not have an allergy to what is in the seat.",0
"My baby loves to play with this during bath time! It's easy for her to hold, bite and play with!",1
"These are excellent passies. My baby preferred these to the slicker finish.  The finish on these is very matte.  For premature babies the base of this pacifier can be too large. It seemed to take up our baby's whole face. He grew into it though. I prefer these passies to the """"orthodontic"""" type as they are more natural looking (closer to the look of a real nipple).  The color of these passies shown in this photo is a little off. The pacifiers are classic baby blue. In the pic they look more purple.",1
"I purchased the Safety 1st High-Def Digital Video Monitor 08280 a few months ago for use with my newborn.  I already had the Graco Digital iMonitor and had been using it for 1 1/2 years with my son, and was desperate for something better.Due to the layout of my home, without a monitor, I cannot hear a crying child unless that child is in full-blown, screaming hysteria (especially if I am alseep myself).  For each of my kids, I wanted video and audio monitoring in order to give myself the greatest peace of mind possible.  I prefer digital technology to 900 MHz for safety reasons (don't want someone else looking into my kids' rooms or listening to the happenings inside my home).First, my complaints with the iMonitor.  The parental unit shuts itself off with no warning of any kind and at any given time.  At first I thought that perhaps the battery was dying, but as it turns out, the battery beeps loudly when it is running low, so that wasn't it.  I wondered if it had to do with having the monitor open or folded closed, but that wasn't it.  Graco's customer service was very unhelpful when I repeatedly called to ask for troubleshooting assistance.  They essentially denied that I was having this problem.  The monitor experiences frequent interference resulting in severe tiling of the image, so that you cannot see the child at all.  The monitor also tends to show the child for a few seconds or minutes, then the screen goes blue and a message comes up that reads, ""initializing video...""  No video or audio monitoring is available during the initialization process.  Since this process can take 10 seconds for every 1 second of actual imaging, the monitor can be completely useless for extended periods of time.  It also loses its connection to the nursery unit and must paired-up again.  This also happens for no apparent reason, and without warning.  Knowing that the iMonitor has these problems has caused me to sleep very lightly, even after my son started sleeping through the night.  I frequently jerk myself awake to check to see if the monitor is still on, and if so, to make sure that the monitor is working properly.  I paid $200 including shipping/tax for the iMonitor.Now the Safety 1st monitor.  I paid $192 including shipping/tax for this monitor in July, a few months after my daughter's arrival.  I love this unit and have only 2 minor complaints, so those complaints before the long list of pros.  The unit interferes with my wi-fi.  If I use my laptop within a few feet of the monitor, I lose my wireless connection.  I have found that my laptop must be at least 10 feet away from the monitor to keep my wireless connection.  This is somewhat annoying, but I can live with setting the monitor down 10 feet away from my computer workspace, confident that I can hear my child through the monitor at that distance, even if I can't see her.  Also, the light on the nursery unit is a large light in comparison to the light on the iMonitor.  The light flashes and is very bright.  Once my child is old enough to be annoyed by the light, I'll have to do something about it, but right now she is oblivious to the light.This monitor is amazing.  The monitor has a crystal-clear image, and has never tiled on me.  The monitor nevers shuts itself off (unless the batteries die), and has never yet lost its connection to the nursery unit.  The monitor can be set so that the image is always on (even when using battery power, which the iMonitor does not offer), or to remain on for a set number of seconds, up to 25 seconds.  When using this option, the monitor can be set to bring the image on if the child is making noise (parent sets the noise-level sensitivity).  If the child is not making any sounds, but you want to look in anyway, a push of the Video button on the front of the monitor immediately brings up the video of the child.  The Safety 1st is very sensitive to sounds, so I rate the audio component as superior also, even when using it on its lowest setting.  The monitor displays a color image when there is adequate light in the room, and then displays a night vision image when the room is dark.  Both types of imaging offer superior quality video.I have been using the Safety 1st monitor and the Graco iMonitor side-by-side for a few months and have noticed that when the two monitors are near each other, the Graco iMonitor absolutely cannot get past the ""initializing video"" stage, which means that it does not work at all.  Even in close proximity to the the iMonitor, the image on the Safety 1st monitor has never so much as flickered.  The Safety 1st is rock solid.I have just ordered a second Safety 1st to replace the Graco iMonitor in my son's room.  This time, the best price I could find was $230 including shipping/tax.",1
After reading the reviews (look for ones that &#34;rank&#34; similar products) I got these and am not disappointed.  They seal amazingly well!,1
"I bought this because the temperature display was important to me and very few baby monitors seem to have it. This monitor has some great features but most of them are not well executed. A few small tweaks by Summer Infant would make it a great monitor; hopefully someone there reads these reviews. In the end, I will continue to use it because I need the temp display and like the option of being able to move the camera but for the high price, I expected much better.PROS- Temperature display feature. I need this because my son seems to get overheated. It is a great feature to have. That said, the temperature is off by 5-6 degrees.  Because it is a consistent difference, I compensate for it. This should be something easy for the mfr to fix so not sure why they don't as many reviewers have commented on this.- Camera pan/tilt/zoom feature. I like the availability of this feature although it is annoying that the slightest touch of the screen moves the camera.  Zoom is pretty useless because camera resolution isn't great, the zoomed image is very blurry.- IR lights on camera not visible to baby.  My prior baby monitor has red night vision lights that would disturb my son.  The camera for this monitor has IR bulbs that are not visible to baby, which is great. Unfortunately, the trade off for that seems to be that the night vision resolution is much less than my old baby monitor.CONS- Automatic turn off of screen when not plugged in.  I understand this is a feature to conserve battery life but there should be a way to keep it on if you want to (which I do). Sometimes my baby plays in his crib and I like being able to keep an eye on him without having to constantly turn the monitor back on. There is also a 2 second delay after pressing the button before the screen comes back on. May not seem like a lot but it is if you are constantly turning it back on.- When screen is on, camera will move at the slightest touch.  Super annoying!!! When the screen is on (which is most times for me), the camera moves at the slightest (accidental) touch of the screen. You should only be able to move/pan the camera by pressing the button on the side, NOT anytime the screen is on.- Inaccurate temperature reading. How hard is it to get a reasonably accurate temperature reading? Mine is at least 5-6 degrees higher than the actual temperature. It seems from other reviews that this is a common issue.- The night vision resolution is pretty low, especially when baby is moving, the frame rate is very low and looks super &#34;herky jerky&#34;. I think this is because the IR bulbs they use are not visible to baby, unlike most monitors. For an newborn/infant, I would NOT choose such a model but instead find a model with higher night resolution (and therefore bulbs glow red at night) but for an older baby or toddler, this is actually better because the bulbs don't glow red it doesn't disturb baby and I since I don't need to be able to see if baby is breathing (like I did when my son was a newborn), it is fine.",0
I can't even start saying what a bad buy this chair is.PROS: Zero (maybe Italian leather!)CONS:1- Expensive2- Very hard to clean3- Some of the straps don't even come out to clean4- Very difficult to remove and replace the main tray (you need to do this if you want to clean the chair). Requires two hands and some muscle!5- Chair is low for the tray (I have big baby. So I am not sure how little babies can even reach the tray)6- The back does not sit up straight so the child is always in 110 degree angle instead of 90.7- Food gets stuck in every fold of this chairIt's a nightmare!,0
"I bought Dream Angle Locks to stop my 1 year old daughter from opening shelves, oven door and so on. Unfortunately the do not work, to what ever you stick it to, wood, metal or glass, just would not hold on, i even tried to glue them, bad idea! Waste of money and damages furniture.",0
"I only wish I knew it was being discontinued, I would have bought another for a gift.  It is easy to push and love that the baby can face you or the world.",1
"Walkers seem hard to find these day, but we keep one at my husband's office for my son to cruise around.  There are no stairs for him to fall down or nasty situations for him to hurt himself.He loves the activity center on the walker and I love that I can take it off.  He can enjoy snacks or other toys on the tray table.  It also wipes clean easily.  He has no problem moving around in it, but we only use it on tile and the sidewalk outside. (No Cars its a gated area).  We haven't had any carpet experience so I can't speak to that.My one product con is that it doesn't easily fold down.  My sister has one that collaples into itself, I wish this did that.",1
I like to use these to add embellishments on for baby gifts. I like that they come in a variety of colors and wash well. They are also a nice size (so many burp cloths now are long but skinny). I will buy these again. The only reason I am giving four stars is because they are not super high quality...but it's fine for the price. :),1
This Nuk shape prevailed as my baby's favorite as early as about 6 weeks old. He's 100% breast fed and his Nuk use hasn't interfered in the least with his latch or early verbalization. I like this particular style because I can see his mouth through the plastic (sometimes he spits up a little and I can see to remove the Nuk to wipe his mouth) and they don't clash with any of his clothes.,1
"I have several sets of the quick-zip sheets, and I love them. They are absolutely amazing.  I use them on both my 3 yr old's toddler bed and my 10 month old's crib. SO, I purchased the mattress pads thinking that if the sheets were so amazing, then the mattress pads had to be somewhat decent.  I was WRONG!  The mattress pads have not held up at all.  I purchased 2 mattress pads.  On the first wash, one of the mattress pads scrunched up (Yes, I followed the care instructions!).  Now, it does not even come close to laying flat, and it covers about half of the entire bed since it is so scrunched up.  The second mattress pad has fared a little better, but not much.  After 2 or 3 washes, it started to scrunch up as well.  It is not as scrunched as the first mattress pad, but still not decent. Both mattress pads need replaced with not much use.  I will be searching for another flat mattress pad (the fitted ones do not work well with the convenience of the quick-zip sheet set).  I am very disappointed with this product.",0
"I just bought this faucet cover for our 9  month old son. It is soft, adorable and I can see how it would fit on multiple sizes of faucets. Unfortunately the material is rather flimsy and after a few seconds of my teething baby standing up at the faucet and putting his mouth on it, he bit a piece right off. I didn't realize at first and had to fish it out of his mouth on the changing table--thank god i saw it before he swallowed it as it was a decent size. They should make the product thicker and more durable so this does not happen and then it would be perfect, right now I worry it is a choking hazard!",0
"My 6 months old love this, he likes the ball, grabbing the elephant nose and rings. At this moment I'm trying to teach him how to drop the ball in.",1
"i bought this pump from a locally owned store the owner was my doula.It seemed ok at first, but the suction was kind of weak. When I first had my daughter I had a hospital grade pump on loan because of my baby's weight drop. I tried again to use it even though the suction was seak, and the milk kept going up the tube even though I used it properly. It started to make the pump break because it went right up the tube and in to the pump itself. When i polled it apart as much as i could I found a spungey part inside that was saturated in wet milk and it seemed like it was growing something because it must not have been the first time my milk went up the tube. My doula has a call in to the company right now, but no resalution has been worked out yet, but I prefer pumping by hand over using this even when it did work properly It just didn't have enough guts to it.I like the idea of the small 1 cup design, and I think the company has the no how to make this a better product, but until there are allot of changes I'll stick with hand expressing and the pump and style if I ever am a working mom.",0
"Got these on sale, wish I had spent my money on a good quality product instead.  After the first wash they came out of the dryer scratchy and falling apart.  I had not at that point even gotten one use out of them.  There is no  way I would put something that rough next to my baby's skin.  These would be great for scrubbing barnacles off of boats or maybe doing house cleaning when you need something with the same texture as a Brillo pad.",0
My 3 year old is still spilling drinks. His favorite method is shaking the cup up and down or flinging it forward to spray the drink out. I was disappointed to find out these cups do not have valves. The drink flows right out of the little holes on the lid. These are going to be returned.,0
"We purchased this bed after much research. We paid more than we anticipated because it held a twin mattress, but still felt like a petite sized bed and would not over consume the room. When we got it home and put it together we noticed hairline fractures on the side boards. Looking closely we noticed that this almost $900 bed was made out of MDF! It's cheaply manufactured! We put it together only to have the hairline fractures completely crack and split the wood. We went to return the bed and the store (not this store) sent us new side boards. The merchant explained that the hairline fractures were ""just what this bed does"" and it does mean it's defective. The bed hardly gets used in our home as our daughter still crawls into our bed with us. Thus, there really is no excuse to have the bed, 2 years after purchase, completely collapse one night. The MDF finally gave and the dowels that are supposed to hold the head board to the bed and provide a safe structure completely popped out as did the screws. The entire bed crashed to the floor and the head board fell on our child's head.  You would think for the price we paid, we could get real wood and maybe some L brackets that would provide a secure structure. This bed is NOT worth the money!  It's too bad because it looks beautiful and is a perfect fit for our daughter's room.",0
"The product is cute, but way too expensive for all you get!  Don't know if they work because my great-great nephew isn't born yet!",0
Very soft and nice size.  Wash cloths purchased in stores are usually not very soft and they are too small.,1
"i exclusively pump breastmilk, and these make it a more pleasant experience. I use 36mm regular flanges and use size XL for my flang with pumpin pals.",1
"After reading many online reviews, asking other baby-wearers, and trying four other baby carriers, It is my opinion that the Ergo is the best carrier for my baby and for me.  I will tell you what I love about the Ergo style in general, and then what I like specifically about the Ergo Sport, followed by the things I don't love about the carrier.  Finally I will talk about how I think my 7month-old daughter feels about the Ergo.First, what I like about the Ergo in general: I like that the Ergo baby carrier puts most of the baby's weight on your hips, making it much more comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  It also has very nice padded shoulder straps.  Next, I love that my baby is in a healthy seated position,(and as far as I can observe, she is also more comfortable.) I have read that carriers offering the front carry position (this one doesn't) are not good for your baby, because instead of being seated, they are just kind of hanging from their crotch and that it puts too much pressure on their spine and hips.  Versatility--I really appreciate that the Ergo offers three different carry positions:  Back, Front, and Hip (your baby faces in toward you in each of these positions.)  A good carrier should carry your baby like you would--close and high.  This carrier does that.  Also, the Ergo has a ""sleep hood"" which I can pull over my sleeping baby to keep her head from bouncing around.  It can also provide privacy for your baby to nurse in the carrier if you choose.  Lastly, because of how it is designed, you can carry heavier children in it (it's rated for up to forty pounds), so you can use the same carrier for your baby, or your toddler.  The Ergo is to be used only when a child can support his own head well, but there is an infant insert you can buy to use before that.  I have not comment on the insert, as my daughter was 6 months when we got it, so we did no purchase the insert.I cannot compare the Ergo Sport to the original Ergo, because I have not tried the original, but these are the reasons I chose the Sport:  First, it claims to be made of a more breathable material for more active and outdoor use--summer is coming, and my baby gets grouchy when she's hot.  Second.  The straps are longer and I want a carrier that will fit my husband (who is a bigger guy) as well as myself.  I have not yet tested the breathability in hot weather and sunshine, but the carrier is VERY comfortable, and seems to be super-durable and well-made.  I'm pleased with my choice.These are the things I don't really love about this carrier:  It does take some practice to become good at getting your baby into and out of it.  The back carry position has been particularly tricky for me, but we are improving.  Kind of along the same lines, some of the positions seem to put the straps and buckles kind of out of reach, so that I have to really strain to get everything all strapped and adjusted.  I know I'm not as flexible as I used to be, but at thirty-two, it really seems like it shouldn't be so tough.  I'm confident that over time I will find what works best for my baby and for me, in getting her in and out of the different positions.  Those are my only complaints, but I'm willing to live with them, because I don't believe that the carrier could be made easier to use, without making it less comfortable and safe.  Also, I know that some will object to the price.  I personally think that a good baby carrier is something worth investing in, and I feel like the Ergo's price is justified by it's high quality, comfort, and safety.Finally, if my baby could tell you what she thinks about the Ergo Sport I think she would say something like this:  ""I like that I am more comfortable for longer, and that my mommy is more comfortable so she lets me stay in it for longer.  I like that I can nurse while Mom is making dinner.  I do wish that the Ergo would let me face out instead of always facing in.  I am not yet tall enough to really see well over the straps of the Ergo, and I like to be able to look straight forward, see everthing, grab everything, and kick my legs.  I think as I get taller I will like it more.""The Bottom Line:  Most baby wearing enthusiasts will tell you that they use different slings, wraps and carriers for different purposes, such as slings or wraps (like ""Hot Slings"" ring slings or the ""Moby Wrap"") for newborns; and more structured carriers (like the Ergo) for older babies, longer outings or hands-free housework.  The Ergo offers quality, comfort and safety for you and your little one, at what I consider a fair price.  I would definitely say it's a good choice in baby carriers.",1
"There's too much fabric to wrap around, it gets hot during the summer with all that fabric.  If you are outside and you want to wrap it, it's so long that it drags over the floor and gets dirty.  I wouldn't rate it high on the ease of use, and also, since you have to tie the end, the knot comes lose after a while.  I didnt use it more than a few times only.  You are better off saving that money and spend it towards an ergo baby or one of those other backpacks.  Or get a sling that you don't have to wrap around so much.",0
"Works perfectly with my Uppababy.  Holds everything, including full coffee cups, and the bonus is that it tilts, so if I need to raise the front of the buggy to go over a step, for instance, the accessory buddy stays level and won't spill my drink or toss my keys and phone.  I really love this caddy.",1
I needed a white bib with some style to go with a costume for my son's first bday and this fit the bill to a tee. He looked very regal- it was like an ascot- and it was very soft and absorbent. It doesn't have those toxic plastic backings which I refuse to have tied to my babies neck all day so if yr baby is a super drooler you are going to have to change his/her bib no matter what material it is. I always have a few backups.,1
Our kids are on a different floor and this helps us listen to them (and talk back!).Customer service was great. One of our units stopped working propery after a storm (and 3 years) and V Tech sent us a new one. Worth the extra $.I'll take V Tech monitors over Summer ones any day...,1
Great quality and very cute!,1
this is one of my 5 month old grandson's favorite teethers.  He didn't like it until he could take it in and out of his mouth by himself.  He is not a guy who likes a paci but he likes this.  It is very soft and easy for him to move around.,1
"This is so easy to install and use!  It was very quick to ship and arrive.  So happy we purchased this, it will make it so easy to adjust to taking our baby out and about!",1
"I bought three of these as gifts, hopeful to give something new and exciting, my three friends did not like using it.  Reported that it got to warm for little fingers before the disk would do anything to file the nail.  Also  disk are to large for little fingers and toes.",0
"How do I love thee let me count the ways....1) Very user friendly2) Amazing design, with harness that loosens to allow the ease in putting your child in the seat and one hand ability to tighten harness.3) For children up to 32"" and 32lbs.4) Can be used with or without a base5) Great padding6) View window in hood7) Very chicBut what make this extra special are the accessories.The Graco snugglider, allows you to take your child straight from the car to this glider that not only swings but vibrates and makes noise. And anyone who didn't want to wake up their child who fell asleep in the car seat can see the importance in this.The Graco snugrider stroller frame, what a great way to be mobile with out having to lug the car seat around. Is a great way to wheel your child into the doctors' office, a stroll around the park, restaurant, or anywhere that you want to go because if he falls asleep you are just a snap way from putting him in the car!Really I am a new mom and this product line is amazing and I can't say anything bad, It is well made and I feel great about the safety of my child.",1
While on holidays my daughter would never eat that well. As she would often be sitting on someone's lap.  Now with this booster seat she is able to have her own tray and eats so much better. It is fantastic to have a lid on it as it keeps the tray clean. It fits on all chairs I have tried that have a back.,1
"Update Jan 2010: After kiddo #2, I stand by my recommendation!  The ""fit"" on this seat is so much better than a giant high chair and they are terrific for travel and so very easy to clean.  I recommend it to anyone who asks about high chairs.**********************************We purchased this based on recommendations from other mothers when I was researching high chairs.  We started solids at six months and the fit was great.  The price is affordable -- much more so than most of the high chairs I was looking at -- and the booster travels *very* easily.  At the grandparents, we put it on the kitchen island and he loves being up at eye level with all the adults...try doing that with a regular high chair!Overall, this seat is really easy to clean.  The tray is easy to remove with one hand and shows no signs of stains even after having tomato sauce and blueberries rubbed all over it.  My only complaint is that the straps that hold the seat the the bottom of the chair do not remove for cleaning.  My little guy likes to grab/pull on the straps with his food-covered hands and it can be a bit of a pain to clean them well.",1
"This is a great pack and play!! It is a good ""old fashion"" playpen--lots of room for baby and toys. Very bright colors, cute ""play stations"" on each side-- a sun that is a mirror, a bee that rattles, etc.  Very, very easy to setup and break down. Great value. Would highly recommend.",1
"I just finished decorating our baby's nursery and I love this crib bedding set.  It looks great! The only complaint I have is that my package was missing the fitted sheet and the """"free"""" onese that was supposed to be included in the package.  The colors are bright and neutral for a baby boy or girl.",1
We cannot say enough good things about this gate.  We bought this gate almost four years ago for the top of our stairs (we have an open stairway in our living room to the lower level.  It is a very strong gate and has held up very well to child torture!  We really like that the gate can go both directions.  I would highly recommend this gate.,1
These tub tattoos are great! Our tub is slightly textured and these stick to the tub with no problem.  They are really cute too they look like they are swimming in a little school.,1
This is a good product. It certainly makes my cloth diapering experience easier. They really hold diapers in place. I look forward to more colors!,1
"Our little guy couldn't sleep unless he was securely swaddled, and would wiggle out of just about every blanket we tried. This one did the trick! No rough velcro, no snaps. He slept in this until he was six months old, and getting rather too big for it.  Then, with a sigh, we passed it on to his cousin.  I highly recommend it for little ones that need a secure, comfy swaddle. Easy to use (even in the dark).  Once we got it, we didn't go a night without it.  This is one thing I always want to get new moms!  I only wish it came in organic cotton.",1
"I have three boys ages 2,4, and 6. It is inevitable that at some point they were going to pull these off the window, but I did not expect that after just a few times they would no longer be clingy enough to stick to the windows. :/",0
"I've had this stroller about 8 months now and use it for my now 2 yr old and 8 month old. After this much time of using it i can definitely comment on what works and what doesn't work anymore. I agree with the other list of pros and cons but want to add somethings I think will be helpful to know after months of use of this stroller.Positives:- Fantastic infant car seat adapter that even fit my Maxi Cosi cabrio fix (bought in europe)- Loads of storage space underneath and can actually hold quite a bit of weight- Great to have the ability to put stools in multiple orientations to suit both kids moods- Pretty smooth ride for kids and both are able to sleep in itNegatives:- The horribly inadequate screws in the handlebar are a very bad design. The entire handlebar is held onto the frame by 2 very tiny screws, and since you have to pull and push on the handlebar to steer with two children in, pull and push on the handlebar to fold, unfold, load, and unload the stroller, the handlebar gets lots of stress put on it. Within 2 weeks one of the screws fell out, we replaced it only to have it fall out again repeatedly. Have replaced it now about 15 times in 8 months and still having the same problem.- The steering isn't as good after several months of use, the stroller tends to pull to the left. It can be pushed in a straight line if you grip the handlebar very tightly, but even that doesn't work well if the above-mentioned screw falls out.I hope that Contours can fix the problem with the inadequate screws because that would then make this stroller a 5 star.",0
We have tried 20 different sippy cups... This is the best one we have ever used!  It's a must buy!,1
"We do a lot of traveling, on foot and by plane and needed something for my 16 month old.  We didn't do much baby wearing when she was younger so I wasn't sure how much she would like this, especially with her growing independence but she loved it!  It fits very well to my body and adjusts easily even after it's on.  The one downside is that when front wearing I have a hard time getting the top clasp snapped myself but I have done it a few time.  We usually stick to back wearing and it's easy on and off, the straps are soft, she can put her arms in or out and it doesn't change how she feels on my back.She doesn't like the foot holsters so I wish there was a way to remove those but that is just her personal preference I think.  Definetly worth the money, especially compared to the prices of some of their competitors!...oh and you can go through security while wearing this.  A must if you plane travel, FREE HANDS!",1
"This gym is the perfect thing for those times when I need to put down the baby for a little while so I can shower, do some dishes, etc. The hanging toys are easily grabbed and mouthed, and when he is in the right mood, he can be content for up to half an hour there. The only thing I would caution you about (especially new moms) is that the item description says this product is for ""newborn and up"". I really can't imagine a newborn getting any pleasure out of this thing. When my son was a newborn, he couldn't grab anything, and in fact barely noticed things that were right in front of his face. He was almost 4 months when we got this, and I think that was the perfect time -- when babies are becoming increasingly aware of their environment and can actually PLAY with the hanging toys. I wouldn't bother trying to use this (or any gym)any earlier than two months, at the youngest.Another plus is that there are a couple of extra loops in the bars, so you can hang additional toys there. I recently added a ""jittery"" toy that makes my baby laugh like crazy. I also like that this gym is inexpensive when compared with other gyms. I don't see any point in spending twice as much for essentially the same thing. And it doesn't hurt that this gym is completely adorable either!",1
"My baby is four months and she is learning to sit for now she needs support. She enjoys a lot to sit on this chair while she plays for a couple of minutes. The chair is very secure and functional, everybody at home likes it specially my baby girl.",1
"My children are three and a half and seven months old. My eldest loves sitting on the bench seat in the back, and it seems to work well for the baby, although it doesn't recline as much as other baby strollers (for obvious reasons). It's as easy to move as a large single stroller, and folds down as well as one. I had a tandem one at first, but it was impossible to get through doors and around shops. Two minor problems with this one. First, about two weeks in, the wheels started screeching horribly. Little WD40 did the trick, and it's back to working a treat. Secondly, if you're used to a storage bar on the handle for drinks, kleenex, keys, etc, this one doesn't have it. It just has the basket below the seat, so the storage isn't great. It was worth the sacrifice for us.",1
"We debated baby monitors for just about 9 months. We went back on forth on the brands and if we should get one with a movement monitor. At the end of the day Toys R Us had a sale on this monitor. The picture is great day or night. We can get about 100-200 feet away from the house out in the yard or garden before signal is lost. The sound is very clear. The color sound bar lights up when baby makes noise which is nice if you have the tv up a little louder or generally don't pay attention very well. We have the camera hung on the wall above the crib and it pans and tilts just fine. I used it to &#34;spy&#34; on my wife while she was nesting in the nursery before the baby was born. Since then the novelty has worn off. The zoom is digital and we don't use it much. This camera has only a single green led visible at night and it is small. You cannot see the infrared lights at all. We have not used the night light mode at all, but have accidentally turned it on once or twice. The two way voice is nice, but our 8 month old doesn't really seem to care. Seems to be a solid product. Does not suffer any noticeable interference from nearby wifi.",1
"OMGoodness this bag has so much space! We just got it in today and love it. The material looks good, it comes with stroller straps that are already attached to the bag so you don't have to worry about losing them either, each section has plenty of space for a baby, an older sibling and a few parent items or another sibling if needed. The side pockets can easily hold two bottles each. Can't wait to use it.",1
I love this monitor. Discreet camera and love the option for multiple cameras with the one handheld display. Great product!,1
"I assumed this was the green syringe bulb you receive in the hospital when your baby is born except white, especially because it's the same brand but it's tiny and not that great of suction. I ended up throwing it away because it wasn't worth the cost to return it :(",0
"This ""lovie"" is the best.  My son received the giraffe from the gift shop at the hospital on the day he was born.  I had forgotten all about it until he was about 8 months old.  Over the course of the next few months, he became very attached and loves this things.  He is now 19 months old and still sleeps with it and loves to hug it when he needs comfort.  It's not called a HuggyBuddy for no reason - it's large & substantial enough for them to grasp and squeeze, unlike some of the other flimsy lovies out there.  It's his buddy.  It's held up very well through multiple (and I mean multiple) washings.  I put it on delicate cycle and dry it on med-low heat.  It's definitely not as fluffy as it was when it was new... but that gives it more character.  The important thing is that it's held up very well, at least in the 11 months of non-stop use thus far.  We had to buy a second in case something ever happens to it. :)",1
"We love them-absorbant, adorable and our go to bibs. Yes, the bibs shrink to almost 1/2 thier size and the snap portion curls up as the things but we like them so much they are worth it.",1
"so cute!! just got it today and everyone already wants to know where I got it from! perfect size for my 4 month old to take her essentials to daycare. love the fabric name tag on inside, very durable fabric. came in a week & is a genuine skip hop zoo!",1
"I purchased this Thermos for my daughter to bring milk to school for her lunch. It works fantastic! I tested it out at home first to make sure the milk stayed cold for the four hours before she would eat her lunch. The milk was still cold after four hours. It probably would still be cold after a longer period of time too. The Thermos works best if it is filled full, or close to it. I wash the lid with the straw in the dishwasher after running hot water through the straw, but I wash the bottom by hand so that the foogoo logo doesn't come off, which happened to her Thermos jar.  This Thermos for her milk matches her pink foogoo Thermos jar in which I pack her hot lunch in the morning.  Great product, highly recommend! Pays for itself overtime, as school milk costs 50 cents per day.",1
"I have bought it from another retailer locally, they were selling at the same price as Amazon. I have to say that the seat is very well made, good materials etc. There is only one problem with it that kills all benefits - the belt clip. Each of two harness belts has two parts - the top one has fixed length, not adjustable and it has that clip on it. The lower part is adjustable with the adjusters at the top of it, where it connects to the upper part. Because of the positioning of these adjusters the plastic clip sitting on the top part of the harness cannot be moved lower. My baby is definitely not the largest one but even without any bulky cloths that clip was right at her neck. It was very unsafe and also totally uncomfortable. And in case if the baby had even a thin jacket it would be totally impossible to lock that clip.I believe that the previous model (or maybe European model?) has different adjusters and the clip can move up/down along the entire harness belt.Another problem was that the head support stick a bit too far back and the car's seat head support was blocking it, so the seat could not be properly secured. It is definitely specific to this seat - I have tried 3 different other seats (including Britax Pioneer, which I ended up keeping) and none of them had this issue.",0
"I am very happy with the quality of this crib. My husband was less than impressed with the instructions, but had no problem putting it together. The quality feels so much nicer than i thought it would for being less than $200.00 There is a flaw in the wood, but nothing that would have made me return it.",1
"I am not sure what was wrong with the one negative reviewers cup (maybe her straw was loose or a random defect), but this is seriously the only cup that my daughter can shake, hold upside down, whether is is closed OR open, and is DOESN'T leak. I have bought every other straw cup out there, and this is the only one I now buy. I now own six of them, and they are all great. No defects in the ones I got.And they are the easiest to clean.",1
"My son is now 3 months old and this has been his favorite toy since birth.  He doesn't seem to care for many of his other toys, but he always lights up when he sees this one!  It is just adorable and the colors are so bright.  It keeps him busy for quite a while.  Get this, you won't be sorry!",1
Love this little rattle. It is perfect for tiny hands to grab! Great toy for infants and babies.,1
"This is a great bouncy seat- this review is for the Rainforest model. It assembled very quickly and easily.  It does seem to have a wider base than some other seats; when we first got it we were tripping over the legs when we would walk by. There is a volume control, music or nature sounds, and the option of having the noise play continuously or only when baby pulls down a noise.  The waterfall is soothing and is good for holding baby's attention. It is also pretty easy to get baby in and out.  The colors aren't too bright or obnoxious and the nature sounds don't make me nuts either!  It is also pretty sturdy- my 3 year old has been caught sitting in it before (38 lbs) and the seat doesn't seem to be any worse for the wear, though obviously that's not recommended!",1
I got this to help one of my cats climb up into the litterbox.  It seems helpful and the rubberized feet prevent it from slipping.,1
"I put this on a cabinet door to keep my one year old out and she walked up to it and tried to get in then it snapped, completely useless now.",0
Grandson loves ~ Easy to clean ~ Simple design does exactly what it is supposed to ~ Would definitely purchase again ~ Love that there are different colors,1
"I bought this for my son and have had it for several years. This looks like the exact same model. We used it some but it was so cumbersome, not functional to the point that I was motivated to write this review. I really wish I had spent this money on a Kettler or radio flyer!1. It was to heavy and awkward for either of my kids to ride comfortably independently.2. The bolts on the adult push handle rusted, and never functioned well to begin with; so it rotates and is really hard to steer.3. The shade is a joke. It looks cool, & a good idea in theory but the reality is that it gets in the way and doesn't even provide minimal shade. We took it off in the first week.We bought a $30 trike from toys r us that our kids prefer ridding on their own. We use this bike more like a stroller.",0
"This pump is really designed for the occasional pumper that would still rather use an electric pump instead of a manual. If you're laughing at the idea of trying to use a manual pump in your situation (ie- pumping both sides 4 times a day) then this pump is not for you. If, however, you fit a lot of the qualifications for someone who might like a manual pump, then this is a nice alternative. I used it about once a day to once a week and it worked great. I had much more success when I used my hand to help rub out my milk (similar to if I was trying to hand express) while pumping. I pumped in the morning when I was a little more full and I could get about 4 ounces per side in 20 minutes. That's not always a good indication of things since every woman responds differently to pumping, but this product definitely worked for me. It was easy to clean, and the stand was nice.Things to be aware of:It does not work well on batteries. I usually kept it right at 50% suction when plugged into an outlet. When using batteries, I had to turn it all the way up, and it still didn't provide a strong enough suction. By the end of my 20 minute session it was basically dead.The flange seems kind of small. They provide an insert to use for smaller sized moms, but you'd have to be pretty small. I think most women might need something bigger. I was an A Cup pre-pregnancy, and maybe a B+ (if you know what I mean) after baby. I fit the flange fine without using the insert, but I'm not sure how bustier women would do.",1
Worst product ever!!! SUction cups don't stick and the whole thing falls down and eventually breaks into pieces. Waste of money!! Extremely irritating and makes you want to break things.,0
Love this Sage Hamper! Came lightning fast with free shipping...Love the Sage Green Color .... very Good Quality!,1
Adorable toy. Perfect for your little princess. Good quality and safe for infants. My almost 2 year old still plays with hers.,1
We use maybe 5-6 bottles a week. I love the brush but it doesn't last! We got one 3 months ago and the top is already coming apart on the sponge. I do like it enough where we bought another one but I couldn't imagine it lasting more than a week if the baby is formula fed or using a bottle regularly.,0
"If someone asked me if they should buy this stroller I would say no. I have had the problem of the front wheel falling off! It was really really shaky when i was pushing it as I was crossing the street (a busy 4 way intersection) it fell off! My son, thankfully, was strapped in but he flew forward. I had to drag the stroller back to the other side of the street while trying to pick up all the tiny pieces. I was pissed! I had to wheel barrow him on the back two wheel all the way to the doctors and back. I did call and they sent out replacement parts and it seems to be fine now.Another thing I hate the way it reclines. My son is 1 and 30 lbs, and he can only sit in it reclined because the little string is not strong enough to hold his weight? The wheels are rusting around the spokes the fabric is coming undone. Yes, from afar it looks really nice but up close it is a piece of crap!The way it closes forces me to put either the handle bars, or the food tray on the ground causing scratches.Now the stroller runs well, meaning it turns really well and moves smoothly so that is a plus. I have had this stroller for almost a year and it is still holding up minus all the other things that have happened.I am a heavy user. So this is pretty much our car. It has been all over the world and back so I give the body an A.",0
"Looks lovely on the wall, it can be arranged in several ways. The leafs and the butterflies come off when scratched at eadges by a curious kid :) Arrived on time and no complaints about quality.",1
I have two granddaughters who so loved these Sophie's; what a great shower gift they are; smell great and are so flexible for infants and toddlers.,1
I got these for my 8 month old daughter at the time. not sure if it was a great idea to go from a level 1 to these level 3's. She was still used to working more to get the milk out of the bottle and she chocked a little with these. Product is still great though. I will still be using them for when she gets older.,1
"This goes very well w forest friends hamper, sheets, decal, and pillow! Love that it as two little pockets in front for diaper cream or such! Washed well too!",1
"This chair is perfect for our 3 year old daugther.  We were using a booster seat that on one of our kitchen chairs, and while there was nothing wrong with that, whenever we had company we were short a chair.  This chair allows our daughter to sit with us while eating dinner and she feels like she is not missing out.  The only reason I did not give this chair 5 stars is because of the price, it's expensive.  From what I've read it's an investment and something we will have for a long time, but still a little too much.  I do like that I can sit and use it myself if I need to.",1
By far our baby's new favorite toy.  It makes a lovely jingle and is perfect for little hands.  Beautifully painted and made in the US!,1
"this product doesn't work AT ALL.  do not buy!!  it's like throwing your monies away!!  we ended up getting Safety 1st Tot-lok system, which is more expensive, but well worth it!!  later we found out our Pediatrician's office uses Tot-Lok system as well!",0
"Let me start off by saying that Amazon really took a step backwards with their Free Super Saver Shipping. They now actually hold your order for about 5 days until they ship it even though it's in stock. I'm pretty sure they're doing this because they want you to pay for shipping instead of choosing free shipping. It used to not be like this, they used to actually ship your order the same or next business day regardless of the shipping method you chose. But let me stop ranting with that, that has no affect on the rating I gave this product.My wife and I have been searching for a walker for our 6 month old baby girl because we'd like to get her started early (she's so active!). We needed something that would be low enough so her feet could actually touch the ground. We've tried some walkers in Baby's R Us, but they wouldn't adjust low enough for her feet to touch. I read some reviews regarding this walker and someone stated that it wasn't low enough, so it kind of worried me that this one would be a no go as well. I took the chance and ordered it. I honestly believe that some people are just unaware that these things can adjust to different heights. This walker goes as low as I've seen on a baby walker on it's lowest setting. My 6 month old's feet can touch the floor and then some. Just to give you an idea, on it's lowest setting the bottom of the cloth seat to the floor measures 7 1/2 inches.The reason I didn't give it a higher rating is because it has a somewhat cheap hollow plastic look and feel to it. It could've been better made. The seat isn't padded at all. You basically just put the seat cloth over the hard plastic seat. The seat itself is deep enough, at least the same as other walkers I've seen. The 3 toys you can attach to the tray are ok, she likes chewing the one on the end (she's teething). It would've been better if there was some sort of electronic toy that played music or made sounds like some other walkers I've seen. We have a low carpet so moving the walker around on it's wheels isn't a problem, though she hasn't quite reached that point to do it on her own yet. Also, the tray is a light pink, not white like the photos make it seem.Overall, this is a decent walker that does the job I guess. It's especially good if your baby is short and other walkers you've tried don't adjust low enough.",0
we gave this stool to our grandson who is 2 & 1/2 and he loves that he can stand on it & brush his teeth by himself. he loves it.,1
"Pad, pockets, and bags.  Easy to lay out with one hand.  Waterproof pad is easy to clean.  Good neutral color, especially for Dads.",1
The cutest bag and easily embroidered. The lining was torn on the inside a little but it was easily fixed.,1
There's nothing wrong with it and nothing too special about it either. The price was the main reason we bought it.,1
"It is not the best seat you can buy for you kid, but when you are on the move and you can't pack too much it fits the purpose. I usually combine it with one of those disposable paper seats.",0
"Pros:Can run over anything.Stable, steady, easy to push.Cons:Heavy and bulky if looking to transport.Compared to my 2012 BOB single Revolution SE, the sun shades are much, much flimsier.The seats are also narrower, but I do understand this as it is a veritable tank the way it is.This is going to get a lot of miles on it with 2u2 and I put a head support in one side for the new baby and won't need the carseat attachment, which gives the older child more space. I would highly recommend this stroller to someone looking for something to park in their garage and take on long walks to the park or around the neighborhood. I would discourage a mall-walker as it is wide and heavy.",1
"So I find myself only writing reviews for products that I don't think we could live without.  The Chicco Smart Support backpack is definitely one of those items.  We are currently traveling in strange places (for instance, we're currently in Uzbekistan).  But even in Europe, sidewalks and elevators are not the norm.  So we needed something to carry our baby (currently 10 months).  We got both this and the Ergo.  Everyone said the Ergo was a lifesaver... well, our son definitely prefers the Chicco.  He can peer over the side or our shoulder and watch everything.  He even takes naps in it (like for an hour!).  My husband likes using it for the convenience factor and likes the lowerback support.  I have used it only a few times and it is comfortable but it is definitely heavier than the Ergo and made for someone taller than 5'5.  We would buy this pack over the Ergo any day...",1
"It is big enough to hold lots of toys. It allows the toys to drain and dry in the bucket, but the water can be easily poured out without emptying the inner bucket. It doesn't have to drain into the tub. Color coordinates with bathroom. Later it can be a wastebasket when we are passed the toys in tub stage.",1
We needed a second car seat base for the childcare provider.  It works GREAT!!,1
This is pretty good stroller and we are happy with our purchase made a year back. Easy to maneuver. Only bad part is that this is bulky and heavy.,1
"This piece is beautiful. We bought the dresser, armoire and crib and they look gorgeous together in the baby's room. The BEST part though? It was delivered in under a week!One issue that isn't that big a deal: The armoire didn't come with the feet it was supposed to have,(packing problem at the manufacturer?) but a quick call to Westwood and it was delivered FedEx to my house within a week.Wonderful all around!",1
"So far so good.  My baby is yet to come and try it out herself, but for the time spent on building the crib and the look/feel of it, I give it 5 stars.  Mattress fits well.  Good safety tips provided.  Instructions were at times a little hard to follow but if you look at the pictures you can't go wrong.  The crib is sturdy, yet light enough to be moved around (we've already done that twice!).  Bought the espresso finish and it goes well with the nursery theme.  It does include the toddler rail.  I was also impressed with the packing; they seem to care about the product.  I preferred this model over the Emily although they are similar and the Emily is cheaper - I didn't like the gap in the rail for when my baby grows older and would be able to stand up in the crib and put her hand through it.  Of course you can get suitable covers for the gap, but less the material surrounding your baby, the better!",1
"We've been using the Thirsties duo wraps, but I decided to try out the Econobum version after we kept having the velcro die on us. I'm not talking about getting lint in the hooks, I'm talking about the edges frayed and the seams came undone after too many washings, leaving velcro tatters that wouldn't hold the diaper on. These seem to be essentially the same type of cover, but with snaps instead of velcro, and no leg gussets. I was a bit concerned about that, but after a week's use...  it doesn't seem to make any difference whether it has leg gussets or not.  I like this cover, it's working out well, and I'll certainly order more. The prefolds it came with are just bonus points.",1
"The pictures show a very nice clean looking Crib with no bolt holes like some other cribs on Amazon. I picked this crib because it looks like higher end cribs without bolt holes on the face. The crib I received has large bolt holes drilled into the front and sides of the crib; 4 in the face of the crib (two on each side of the face, one for a bolt going into the lower frame rail and another for the top frame rail.) These drilled holes are about the size of a dime, maybe slightly smaller and prominently visible. There are also a series of bolt holes drilled into the sides of the frame. None of these are in the pictured crib. I don't believe Amazon is being deceitful but I do believe the images they received and posted are doctored. I realize this is not as expensive as cribs you can buy in stores that look more like furniture than wooden erector sets, but I based my decision on the pictures shown, and was definitely deceived when making the choice to buy this crib. Of the hundreds of Amazon purchases I have made over the years, this is the first time I received something that was different than what was pictured.",0
We have a Graco Lauren crib and this mattress fit perfectly and is just the right amount of firm for a baby to be safe and comfortable.  It came packaged well and on time and we were completely satisfied.,1
"I have an UPPA VISTA, the handle bars are at a 45 degree angle with no bend in them. The Jolly Jumper fits on the handle bars but the bag also sits at a 45 degree angle. Basically, this would work if I always carried around a drink with a cap on it but never an open container. If you have a stroller that will hold the bag level it will probably work better for you.Aside from the angle of the handle bars, I wasn't thrilled with it in general. The cup holders are not large enough to fit larger coffee cups or even larger water bottles. There is nothing that really gives the caddy any structure so the bottom part swings while the top stays rigid, making things bounce around. I tried this caddy head to head with the Sunshine Kids Buggy Buddy (which is cheaper) and found that caddy to be better material, better structure and the cup holders stretch to hold larger cups.",0
"I was looking for something fun and colorful for our daughter that we're expecting in February and wasn't faded pastel colors and girly themes.  This set is just as intense in color in person and the fabric is a nice density (it's not so thin that you can see through it when you hold it up to the light like some other bedding sets I have looked at).  It does have an appliqued giraffe in the middle of the quilt (the rest are printed on the material, but it's a high quality print in my opinion).  The shipping was also lightning fast and it arrived in perfect condition.",1
Love these little pacifier holders. The make it easy for babies to hold it and they have a wide selection.,1
"I brought them for my child's princess party to fill with Party Favors. They are very cute and sturdy. I wasn't expecting such great quality for less than $2 a bag. I would highly recommend these bags. They are well worth the price. You could even add stones,ribbons, or buttons to dress it up even more.",1
I purchased for my 5 month old infant that still needs support sitting up.  He enjoys playing with the toys.  Looks like it will convert easily to a booster seat for the table.,1
"It works really well.  It seperates into five parts for easy cleaning.  I have always spoon fed my children, but when you have a four month old that the doctor said to feed solid foods to, well it's not so easy with a spoon.  Was really happy to get this feeder.",1
"Great quality and bright colors. I wash this with my cloth diapers just about every day. I have used the dryer and put it in the sun and its still holding up! I have only had it about 2 weeks now, but I am still very pleased with it.",1
Adorable... but way too big for Layette.  Others have said the same. I returned it because I cannot tell at what age it will actually fit.,0
"very cute, was a gift & the soon to be parents thought it was a nice gift. I would get them again for a gift.",1
Beautiful. This changing pad is nice and fluffy and matches perfectly with the matching bedding. Absoultly gorgeous! Fit onto changing pad with no issues.,1
"This car seat is so hot! My poor little toddler was soaked when she got out. If you live in a southern or desert climate, I do not recommend this car seat.",0
"I actually want a second one. Perfect to travel with, easy to take down and put back up. Easy to wash and my daughter loves it. It attaches to an existing chair, to save space.",1
"Unfortunately, it doesn't block the sun.",0
"This carrier far outshines the Snugli I tried first.  The Baby Bjorn is much more lightweight and better designed.  You can load baby in easily and there are no buckles in the back to worry about.  Adjustments are easy to make, both for your comfort and baby's.  My five month old daughter loves it for facing out when she's awake and alert, and when she gets sleepy I can quickly turn her facing in and she usually goes to sleep.  I went flying with her and they searched us everywhere, usually making me take her out of the carrier.  It was easily done, even with one hand holding other items.  A wonderful product.",1
I like that the tray has a lip at the end so things do not fly out and the chair does not scream I am in a house full of kids. Subtle and a good purchase. The only problem is my 14 mo old girl can lift it off if she wants.,1
"This is the best baby bathtub! It's perfect for my 6 pound baby. She is well supported by the bump and doesn't slide down or slump over to one side. The size is just right to keep her in place so I can have one hand on her and one hand free to grab soap or the washcloth or towel. I started using it right after the belly button stump fell off when she was ten days old. I had another tub for my first baby, but this is so much better. If you've been looking for a good baby bath, this is it.",1
I bought this play mat for my 3 month old because it was cheaper than the other play mats.  I shouldn't have wasted my money.  The colors are un-interesting to a baby (blue is the last color they can see) and it only comes with 3 toys.  Maybe he will enjoy it as a tunnel but it is nearly useless as a toy for babies under 6 months.,0
"Oh yes, the suction is great...but one of them stop working at the second time I tried to pull it down...nothing. No, I would not buy again or recommend them.",0
Really good product at an affordable price. Son was 12 months when I got it and he took to it well. When he wakes up in the middle of the night he turns it on himself to help soothe himself back to sleep. No negative feedback to report.,1
My kids love this chair so much that we had to buy a second.  I have a four-year old and a two-year old.  Both kids fit great in these chairs.,1
These snap right into place and keep a secure seal. I use wet erase markers to mark the date on top. A good investment for added convenience.,1
"After using the Avent system for 6 weeks My son was not a happy baby due to cramps, gas and huge burps. After switching to the Playtex system I noticed a huge difference in his actions. His cramps and gas had stopped. He ended up being a very happy baby that cried a lot less. His burping was not excessive and never burped a period of time after feeding like he did with the Avent bottles. He turned out to be a happy baby.. Happey baby = a happy mommy... A++++ on this system",1
very nice,1
"This product was super easy to assemble, and I love that it converts into a play yard. It is portable, comes with its own carrier. I love this co-sleeper! The mattress it comes with is firm, not hard; it has a sturdy bottom to support itself on the frame. The only drawback I found to this product was that I had to purchase the extension kit, but now it aligns perfectly to my queen-sized 30&#34; tall bed. I don't fault the company though, because I'm sure 30&#34; is not standard height for beds. I'm overall extremely satisfied with this purchase. This is definitely built to last!",1
"this stroller rocks, light and easy to use, fold nicely and works good with the separate car seat adapter , highly recommend this to others",1
"Using this for trips to the grocery store. My son is 3 and hates to sit in the cart. So far, it's been fantastic and he stays with me. I'm planning to use it this summer with the stroller when baby #2 gets here!",1
"After using the stickers, our boy is free of mosquito bites. With OFF spray, we worry about DEET all the time. This sticker has no DEET and we applied the stickers only on his clothing, so there is no direct contact. Love it, 100% recommend it.",1
Perfect for taking out those nasties.  It won't hurt child and it makes it easy especially when they can't blow their noses. I usually use a little saline solution before to loosen up any hard or dry bits but then it's just simple to pluck those buggers out.,1
"I have similar gate from several years ago (not sure on the exact year). The old version has metal hinges and a metal locking mechanism. This new gate has plastic hinges and a plastic locking mechanism. The plastic hinges are an improvement from the previous design. However, the locking mechanism is lacking in my opinion. It simply won't keep the gate secured in place. My 2 year old can easily pull back on the gate and pop it out of the clasp. It appears that the plastic will deform slightly, which is enough to allow the gate to open. It seems to be the victim of cost cutting measures. Luckily, this new gate is used as a pet gate and I use the old one for the child gate. It is unfortunate. I like the look, but I was lead to believe this was a safety gate. i don't find it anywhere near as secure as the older version.",0
"Bought a couple to place around the house.  2 out of the 3 toilets were so thin on the rim that the lock almost slides off.  Was able to adjust a bit for one of those, but have resorted to closing the doors instead.  Doesn't seem to fit onto every toilet.",0
"Just so you know this does squeak, I missed that when I was purchasing this, so it is very loud and squeaky.  The baby likes it and loves to chew on the legs and head.",0
"The best invention ever! My daughter has been using the same Munchkin Snack Catcher for about a year and a half now and this product is very durable. I like this brand (compared to the Snack Trap) because here the edges are soft and rounded. It is very comfortable for little hands (the other one pokes you!). I've recently purchased a double pack to give one to a friend who lives in Europe and eventually keep the second one for maybe a next child. I've also attached to the handle a little clip like a """"c"""" ring that i got from some other baby toy and that way i can hook up the Snack Catcher on the stroller harness or just about anywhere (on my belt even). I highly recommend this product.",1
"I didn't realize it was so small, I thought it was bigger in the picture but it ended up fitting perfectly in my purse. The color matches closely to my tan zebra striped purse. I bought a diaper bag for $16 and this is so much better; I can use whatever purse or bag I want without spending the money on ONE diaper bag. I can put so much stuff in here, all the baby necessities including my own wallet and personal products. I would definitely recommend this for anyone not wanting to spend a ton of money on a diaper bag.",1
"My great granddaughter LOVES this. She's 4 months old and really loves the whole thing, projector and sound. I would recommend it for any baby or small child.",1
"I love this tub, it is very &#34;girly&#34; with pink sparkles.  Seems sturdy enough and fits perfect in my kitchen sink.",1
"This cup stinks. First of all I got a blue cup for my daughter. Secondly it spills every where very easily. Finally, my daughter cannot get the last 1/4 of the liquid out of the cup. Not worth the money.",0
"We are pleased with our choice to buy this carseat. It fits well in the back/middle seat of our older Camry. Our 18mo old has lots of room to grow and seems much more comfy in it than in his Britax infant seat he outgrew. It has a bit more padding and is a breathable, wipeable fabric, we definately like the storm fabric option best (no sweaty back). Installed with seatbelt and front tether it is tight and unmovable, unlike other carseats we tried. We like that it is made of steel.",1
Not only are these perfect for introducing fruits and berries but we also use it as a teether too! I just stick an ice cube in the little net and my little one loves how it feels on his little gums!,1
The woombie is worth the extra cost.  My daughter was using a swaddle sleep sack and figured out how to get her hands out the bottom of the swaddle and then would pull the fabric up over her face trying to get her hands to her mouth.  The woombie prevents this and my baby likes to hold her hands together at night.  I think that we will start letting her have one arm out soon so she can suck her hand and the convertible allows for that.,1
"I had to order this bag in a hurry as I was hospitalized towards the end of my pregnancy.  I've never had a ""fancy"" diaper bag and had no idea what to expect.  I was THRILLED. It is gorgeous, bright, protected in clear pvc type covering, comes with a wipe holder/changing pad and stroller straps.I can fit, in no particular order:10 diaperswipes2 bottlesbottle of waterformula container3 outfitsrandom hairbrush/bulb syringemy wallet/phonewith room to spare. It is definitely a roomy bag, and the straps are long enough to slip over the handles of your stroller.LOVE this bag.",1
"My 14 month old daughter loves it! Still has room for her to grow, she can turn around, stretch her legs, play with the colorful fish design. Much bigger than the Duck inflatable bath tube we had. (which she did love as well). Now that she is bigger and interacting more and playing, this one fits better the bath time, which is really a play time with her daddy that she enjoys so much!",1
my sister in law loves them. They are hand made. They are perfect! I wish I could have my own pair they are so cute.,1
"I highly recommend this feeding set to anyone who is just starting solids with their little one. The set is durable, well made, and very well designed (like all OXO Tot products). The plate and bowl have a rubber bottom which helps prevent slipping or movement on the dining table/highchair tray. I love that the bowl has a seal tight lid for storing food in fridge when not in use.",1
Perfect! Exactly as shown in the picture! Is adorable and the colors are vibrant and match perfectly with our white crib.,1
"MY SON LIKES IT A LOT, EASY TO MOUNT, NICE COLOR, GOOD TO VERY GOOD QUALITY. GOOD PRICE ALSO. I RECOMMEND FOR EVERYDAY USE.",1
Using charlie bannana on my second child and have 2 using them at once right now since my Children are 13 months apart. Love them. They start fitting around 8lbs. Cute prints in this box,1
"It came in time, works good for my jj cole stroller. Love that it has extra little pockets for my Keyes and money, you can even put your cellphone. I would buy again from this seller.",1
"We got this for our newborn and 2 year old, works great and they both like it.  We like how the back seat lays flat and the front seat sits up straight.  It is big to lug around though.",1
"I have had this item for a few months now, my son plays with it every day and he is still very entertained by it. I noticed it is now $15 cheaper than when I bought it, so just get it okay! I think everyone will love this. My son is now sitting and I love that you can flip the piano to the upright position. Awesome toy!",1
I was looking for something compact and not to heavy to take a long on trips to theme parks. This stroller is just that. The only upside is the detachable umbrella. When folding your stroller make sure you fold the umbrella over the handles or else you'll get a pretty funny pointy looking umbrella that just wont straighten out. Also make sure you use the velcro straps to attache the umbrella not just the plastic clamps or else that thing might just smack your kid in the face. Besides that annoying umbrella i love it. Its tall enough for me and my husband not to hunch over while pushing it around. My husband is 5'11 and i'm 5'5. It has just a big enough basket under the stroller to store a small blanket and a small bag. There is also a compartment on top with space savers perfect to hold your drinks. I bought 2 stroller one for my 2 year old son and one for my 5 year old daughter. They're both about average built and they fit perfectly. The stroller seat has enough recline to hold my kids in place after falling asleep. They're heads arent rolling forward after a long day like most umbrella strollers. You can't beat the price its exactly what you paid for.,1
"The Recaro High Back Booster is perfect; the exact booster for three vehicles - two for the parents and one for the grandparents.  It has the capability to grow with our grandson until he is eight or nine. Cushy seat he wanted and loves, high back and sides that keep him in his seat even if he falls asleep.",1
"We have only used one other brand in the past 20 months and prefer FuzziBunz.  Things we like:&#8226; back loading pocket&#8226; easily & fully adjustable&#8226; have fit well from infancy to toddlerhood&#8226; washes well - no stains&#8226; brand has good customer service&#8226; durable&#8226; soft/comfortable&#8226; surprisingly as easy as using disposable but saves hundreds of dollarsProblems:&#8226; using our HE washer, I don't think it pushes enough water through them so they don't get fully clean without a pre-rinse and sometimes a post-rinse.&#8226; Washing instructions can seem complicated and confusing, especially if you read blogs online about it. However, I highly suggest if you are having rash issues, switch detergents until you find something that works.  I stuck with special &#34;cloth diaper detergents&#34; for far too long and regret it.  ALL free & clear works the best despite the fact it is not one of the &#34;recommended&#34; detergents.&#8226; Leaking.  We have had this issue from the very beginning and have used 2 inserts every single time. We just have a heavy wetter. If we change diapers close to every hour, there is no issue but sometimes that is not feasible. To make it easier, we decided to use disposables most nights and even then we get occasional leaks. We don't have the means or the time to spend figuring out which combination of diapers/inserts/covers works best for nighttime.I don't know anyone who has not had some of these issues with every type of cloth diaper they have used, so it is not necessarily an issue with the diaper itself.  I also know that disposables have their own issues and things just depend on how they fit your child.At any rate, I highly recommend FuzziBunz.",1
"We've had this chair for 5 years and through 2 kids and soon to be a third.  We knew we needed something to save space and we wanted our child to really be part of family dinner time when we had our first son.  We strapped this on a typical wooden chair and used it as a high chair for a while when I needed to plop stuff on his tray.  I've always hand washed the part that clips on to the chair because it would take up my whole dishwasher.  The part that comes off would go through the dishwasher sometimes.  That was a pain in the butt when my kids got old enough they could pop it off and at that point I would just use the tray-my parents bought another one that set on and it made a HUGE mess with them flinging food everywhere because it was easier to get off from the time they were just starting solids.  We used it up to the table from the time my boys were around a year old each and they felt like they were part of the family instead of most kids that are in a high chair and shoved away from the table.  We've used this on short trips, at diners, etc besides just our home.  It's very easy to clean and very easy to transport and adjust to a new chair.  The only thing that doesn't clean super well are the straps-those are a bit stained but that's to be expected.  After 5 years it still looks pretty new and we still use it every day.  We even use it as a chair to boost our kids up so I can cut their hair.  I would not recommend any other like product-this really is the best out there and we've used several and different friends' homes and family's homes.",1
"We bought two of these to section off three formal rooms in our house when we adopted a super high energy, fluffy-coated, ""power chewer"" mixed breed dog.  We quickly learned that our lovely little wolf of a herding dog could chew through a Chippendale mahogany ball-and-claw leg in a matter of seconds.  He is much better after a few months of growing up, but we still have these in place.  They keep him from absent-mindedly chewing the fringes off the oriental rugs or bumping into lamps or art. And from scratching the hardwood floors and leaving hair all over the place.  We considered dark wood screen and gates, but after shopping and online research, were convinced these were the best looking gates around.  They don't look like they are pretending to be fine furniture and failing.  They are just really nice simple metal gates.  The dark neutral color is great.  I love that they are very tight in place but don't need to be screwed in, so when and if we decide to remove them the walls and stair rails will still be fine.  I agree with another reviewer that the while sticker is nearly impossible to take off and draws way too much attention to itself. I also agree that it would be nice if the opening were a few inches wider.  But these aren't any big deal.  Installation is easy, but if you want the gate to open and close perfectly - easily and by itself -- you may need to spend a few minutes adjusting screws to get the balance right.  We're really happy with these gates and highly recommend them to dog owners who want gates that are study but attractive.  FYI: for our upstairs offices we chose a cheaper gate that moves quickly from one door frame to another (Regalo Easy Step Metal Walk Through Safety Gate).  It isn't as study or handsome as this one, but it works great in a less visible area, or when you want to move it frequently from one to room to another.",1
"it works but I would not buy it again or recommend it to someone.it doesn't update the temperature as the water temperature changes you have to take it out of the water, and shake all the water out of It. then you can put it back in the water to get you reading at that time.",0
Perfect for keeping little legs warm. I need to order some in every color!  I was pleased with this purchase and the price.,1
"I bought this for my son and he loves it!  I set out to compare prices and I found the best price here. Great deal for an awesome item!  It was simple to put together, the toys keep Ryder entertained. In the end, he and I are most pleased with this product!",1
"They were cute but could have found similar in the store, but the set is still cute for a baby girl.",1
I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation. This case is great. Very light but strong and nice color.,1
"We had previously used a bunch of smaller mats, but this one has become the one that's taken over for everyday use. It's nice and large and gives a 6 month old baby enough room to start crawling. It's super easy to wash - just throw it in the washing machine and hang dry. We liked it so much we recommended it to my sister and her kid loves it too. This purchase is a no-brainer. I'd put it on my list of &#34;must-have&#34; things to have for a new baby.",1
These are waterproof and wash easily in the sink in between washes in the laundry.  Not unreasonably sturdy - the stitching may tear a little on the pocket if you are using and scrubbing it and hanging it up to dry three or four times a day - but all in all a quite good version of this kind of bib.,0
"I had high hopes for this product, but baby wriggled one arm halfway out as soon as I put it on him, and then screamed because his arm was twisted up behind his back. I tried again later, hoping that first time was maybe a fluke, but he did it again immediately. This would probably work a lot better for a less active baby.",0
"My husband and I are very pleased with the outcome of using Happi Tummi Colic and Gas Relief Waistband. It relieves our newborn stomach discomfort, calms her down and even helped her poop when we first started using it. I would recommend this product to everyone with a newborn - sooner or later you'll need something to calm your baby's upset tummy and this is one efficient way to do it.",1
"Keeps my daughters milk cold and is very easy to clean! It comes apart so easily and we love it, it is her favorite sippy cup so I want like 5 more!!!",1
"These bumpers are safe and keep legs, arms, and pacifiers in the crib. They also protect against hard head bumps. The bumpers have breathing holes and are breathable if the baby rolls into them. They are sturdy and can be put on tightly. As the baby gets bigger and stronger they may be able to pull them down (but unlikely if on tight enough and safe even if that does happen). Gives me piece of mind more then traditional bumpers. A little difficult to put on at first and need to be washed before use.",1
"I use this as a changing pad and I've loved it! It is comfortable, lays flat even after washing, folds easily and compactly and is cute. I love that I can just throw it in the washing machine. It's held up great!",1
"I purchased this wonderful blanket for my baby.  My plan was to carry it along with me whenever I would visit family and friends at their homes.  I could then lay my baby down or interact with my child on a clean surface.  The blanket is 16.0 x 4.0 x 11.0 inches, which will accommodate adults well.  I was pleased when I received the blanket to have discovered the excellent craftsmanship that was put into the creation of the piece.  The quality is absolutely top notch!  The surface material also seems like it could be easily cleaned if a spill should occur.  The only slight con I have of the Essentials blanket is that it is a bit on the heavy side.  This is only a negative if one is expecting to carry it for a long period of time.  Otherwise I adore this blanket and highly recommend it!",1
"We bought this for our daughter and a nice blue for our son. We moved to Germany recently and our 8 year old needs to be in a booster until she is 12~ This fit the bill. It's pink and girly, which she likes. It's reasonably comfortable, and for the price you can't beat it. The cup holder held her hot chocolate in tact on a long journey without spilling. This is important cause some cup holders are worthless. I like that it slides back in when not being used. I will say this seat is a little harder than my sons evenflo brand booster - a little less cushion on the Cosco brand. Again, the price can't be beat here on Amazon.I might mention we aren't using the backs right now since we take short trips so I can't say yet if it's comfortable to sleep in with enough head support, but by looking I imagine it would.Overall worth a buy that will last for years!",1
"Despite all the reviews I read I bought this item anyways. At first I loved it. I put a tiny bit of bleach in it so it didn't mildew. The darn thing deflated after just having it for about a week. The thing was barley played with. I thing I put my son by it twice to encourage tummy time. Which worked great, but when I brought it put for a 3rd time my son padded down and I noticed his hands were wet and the sides were all deflated. I don't know where it was leaking from, but clearly it was. Waste of money.. Which is too bad because I was really looking forward to having it.",0
"I originally bought a Skip Hop Duo because it was recommended by Baby Bargains - and quickly fell out of love with it.  The stroller clips I thought were so nifty just threw off the center of gravity and tipped over my stroller.  When I put the bag over my shoulder, it would slip off - which is so frustrating when your hands are full with your baby.  In addition, every time I went to throw it over my shoulder cross body style and then picked up my baby - things would drop out of it one-by-one (especially on the airplane: Argh!) because it didn't have a full secure closure.  In addition, I felt like I was digging to the bottom of the bag to find the items I needed.  Functionality is essential to me - and this wasn't cutting it.This started my search for the perfect diaper bag.  This one has it all: Ju-Ju-Be BFF.",0
nice fit and exactly like the picture soft a cute good quality my grandson is 9 months fits great he has a big head to it fits great perfect i like,1
"This is a fine carrier for the price at around 2/3 the cost of a Bjorn, but there are a number of difficult aspects that make it inferior.  Just spring for the Bjorn.This product is advertised as being able to put it on yourself, but it's necessarily a two-man job both to put it on and to remove it.  Once it's on, however, it's quite stable if a little tight.If you've ever used a Bjorn, you'd probably chuckle watching someone try to strap the Infantino on.  A Bjorn is elegant.  You put on the shoulder straps and then attach the carrier to them.  With the Infantino, it's awkward.  You put on one shoulder, clip the waistband around your back, slide the baby in, put on the other shoulder and then attempt to attach the side clips.  There's also another clip on the back at your shoulder blades that locks the shoulder straps in place.  My wife and I could not do it by ourselves -- with or without balancing a baby at the same time.  You have to be in the circus to perform those maneuvers by yourself.I seriously question whether the Infantino could comfortably support a 35 lb baby.  Sure, the thing ain't going to fail on you and drop your kid to the ground, but our 8 lb babies are already pressed fairly tight to our chests and there's not much adjusting room left.Other elements that make it inferior to a Bjorn are the fact that you can't place your baby facing forward and the fact that your baby must straddle your stomach (where as the legs hang down in a Bjorn), which must lead to some hip stress for the child.Overall this is a very average carrier that should definitely cost under $35.",0
"Our stroller is the coolest color, green, for our son! Its light weight and we havent had an issue with it, such as banging our feet on the wheels or back bar. I love how our son has grown with it. I dont particularly like how the shade fits on it but we dont use it that much.",1
"This quit working after three weeks. One hour it worked, still in the same place, tried to turn it on and nothing. Changed Batteries and nothing.Cute when it did work and my baby loved it. Was so sad it quit  working.",0
"ProsMachine washableBaby may face you or face out when in frontBaby may be carried on your backGood priceVery adjustable-- I am 4'11"" and just over 100 pounds, while my husband is 6'1"" and about 175 pounds.Easily adjustableEasy to get baby in and out once you get the hang of itComfier than most around this priceConsI can't find a height restriction for this product-- My six month old seems too tall for itMy back always hurts after carrying my daughter in this and she doesn't even weigh 14 poundsIt rides up in the back and doesn't stay where it should",1
"There were only a few people that used the cards, but I thought it was a great gesture.  I liked the product!",1
We have three different baby gates in our house. This is definitely my favorite. It feels secure and is very aesthetically pleasing. Being able to have a stop point on either side to keep it open is a nice feature.,1
"My son loves these....I keep them everywhere so that he does not chew on clothing or toys. Thay last forever, even with a 7yo chewing on them.",1
"This is the second pair I bought, the first one lasted about 5 months but my wife wasn't using them that much. In a trip in vegas we start using them and one of them broke. So I order more (thanks amazon prime) and got them next day. I did it because we needed them too much but they didn't lasted much after the 3rd or 4rd day of use one of them broke again and it was carrying a small bag with a T-Shirt, I don't know if it was defective because it wasn't that much weight.So If you want them for carrying small and light things they are excellent but do not put more than 1 thing on them.",0
"I have a 10 month old who won't sit still for a diaper change, much less to have his temperature taken. I had tried the rectal thermometer, the digital under-the-arm, and the ear thermometer and I couldn't get him to sit still long enough for a reading on any of those. The Temporal Artery Thermometer works in seconds-- and he seems to actually get a kick out of it. I usually do 3 quick readings to make sure that it is accurate and that has worked out well. I would absolutely recommend it for ease of use and price.",1
I search long and hard for an outlet cover that would fit our child monitor plug in and still leave room for me to plug in another item. This product did the trick and is safe to leave in my daughter's room when she's playing.  It may be bulky a little...but it has to be to enclose the big monitor plug ins. I am very happy I bought this product.,1
This is my daughters new favorite. The toy is put together beautifully with bright colors and different textures on each wing.,1
"I got these for my twins to use at about 6 months.  The velcro in the back holds tight, the length around the neck is a little snug on them now, and they are 10 months.  One of the bibs looks like the inside waterproof part melted and was all scrunched up and not fixable so I threw it out.Other than that, the colors are great!  The terry fabric is great, and the waterproof liner that is inbetween is so nice for keeping their shirts dry.  Really good bibs over all, I gave it 4 stars because one melted, and the necks are a little tight.",1
Keeps food piping hot and doesn't leak. Fits perfectly into lunch boxes and at 10 ounces is the perfect size. I also like the attractive design.,1
great diaper! SO soft! zero leaks with my heavy wetter! Lots of room to grow in this diaper! LOVE it!!,1
It is small as it should be for little babies that are eating solids for the first time. My baby is really happy with these spoons.,1
"The only pacifier my daughter will use, and now it's not carried in any stores near me, so I had to order off of amazon.",1
This changing pad is so soft and fits great on our contoured changing pad.  We've received lots of compliments and it doesn't shrink or get wrinkled after a wash.  Not sure why it's called Handsome puppy as it doesn't seem to have anything to do with puppies but my husband and I love it nonetheless.,1
"It works well as stated . Satisfied with it . Im using pump in style , fit well to the holes. It a great replacement to grab at such a low price",1
I wanted to get a swing that:- Plugged in or used battery- Had music (especially either classical or nature)- Had a mobile- Was upholstered for comfort- Had good reviews... so I read everything I could find and decided on this one b/c the only two negatives I could find were that it wasn't blue it was purple. (It is actually mostly cream with accents in a shade between light blue and lavender) and that it was noisy to run. You can hear the engine when running it if you don't turn on the sound but it is not that bad and I am picky. I get annoyed listening to my dishwasher or washing machine. My six week old son likes it most of the time and it helps me to get a few things done around the house.BTW VERY few swings can be plugged in or use a battery. I didn't want to be stuck at home with a swing that didn't work b/c I needed to ruplun to the store to get batteries.,1
My son loved these cups. They came in fun colors.I loved the storage idea of the cups. After use i can stack multiple cups onto one another to take up much less room in the cabinets.They do not leak and have easy handles to hold onto.The one downside is the plastic on the zippy part is not a strong plastic and it does disform when your kid while chew on the lip.,1
My son is small in the waist so jeans tend to fall down on him. This made them stay up and not have to be bothered with when changing his diaper.,1
"When you are a mother of twins (or two small children for that matter) you become accustomed to lugging around huge pieces of baby equipment - it's part of the job. With that being said, this jogger, by far, is the easiest to cart around - not too heavy, not too many parts and it is nice and sturdy (not to mention that my 6 mo old boys love it!). It's great for moms like myself to have - no more excuses on why I can't run any more! Handles great - it's no different than other joggers so steering can be cumbersome but it's a nice smooth ride and as long as you don't need to make a series of sharp turns - you'll love it!",1
"I love it!  It definitely covers my playpen and the stroller very well!  There are no bugs that have been able to penetrate it.  The best part is that I can still see my little one, and she can see me, too!  It is very compactable when not in use.  VERY easy to use.",1
My 5 month old loves this.  He plays on it everyday.  The only thing is that it doesn't have great space for him to roll over on.  He's starting to try to roll.  We have another mat that gives him plenty of room for that.  We still love this product though and would buy it again.,1
What baby doesn't like keys?  I got these to keep in the diaper bag and the baby has enjoyed them when we are on the go.,1
"This works great for our small space. I normally don't even use the try, I just put the baby in it and pull it close to the dining table when we all eat together.  Been using it since before she could sit. At 4 months.  I also got one for my Mother's house, so when we go there, she is set. You can order additional chair covers for when in the wash. As many people said, the only thing is that it is hard to clean the straps and they do get food on them right away.",1
"This rattle is my 7 1/2 month old son's favorite toy.  He will choose this over any of his other toys, even ones with lights and sound.  The rattle is brightly colored (and as red, white, and black are the colors that babies react to most, that is a plus).  He loves the little rings around it as well.  I love this toy due to the fact that at 7 1/2 months he is not aware that he can hurt himself when he is flinging his arms around.  This rattle is soft and does not hurt him if he hits himself with it while he is playing like some of his plastic ones do.  I would definitely recommend this to any parent.  We originally bought this because he is fascinated by the Cat in the Hat on TV.  Even if your child is not a fan of the show, he will be a fan of this toy.  It is worth the price for sure.",1
"The bassinet had no hardware with it and we had to contact the manufacturer to obtain that - there was no cost, just inconvenience. The price versus quality rates this as 3 stars in my opinion.  The canopy stay crooked - flimsy materials.  The sheet is too coarse feeling for a newborn baby.  It will suffice for one baby for a couple of months, but if this would be needed for more children, I would have returned it.",0
It looks great!This will be a gift for our new grand baby.Her mom will save all her important items in it.,1
I purchased this clip for my daughter over a year ago and with the arrival of #2 I decided to purchase another one.  I purchased the same brand but not the same color.  I am sad to say I am very disappointed in the quality of this clip.  There are strings (which is really plastic thread - kinda like fishing line) all over it.  I started to cut them off when I noticed that sections of the fabric and label are not entirely sewn on.  I can fit my finger in between the 2 pieces of fabric in one area.  This is nothing I can't fix but disappointed in the quality and wanted to make others aware.,0
"It fits the opening I needed it for, however, the actual gate portion is very narrow.  It is difficult to walk through, if you are carrying anything large.  It is very sturdy and fits firmly in the doorway.",0
Just as advertised.  Sturdy and safe.  High quality.  Easy set up.Bucket is for small children and gives them good support.  A child would not fit in the bucket before he/she would get anywhere close to the weight limit of this swing. If you want something for a 3-4 year old you should probably look at larger bucket swings,1
"I love the bumper, it was a the perfect fit and the colors are absolutely perfect mix. I am so glad I decided to go with the Dena Happi Tree theme. 100% happy with my purchase!",1
I used these on my son until he was around 4 months old..  They are awesome and helped him sleep!  Get them if you have a new baby...you won't regret it.  (NOTE: I did stop using them at 4 months b/c my son was breaking out of them.  But I felt it was time to stop swaddling anyway so it wasn't a big deal to me.),1
"The pleats on this are very poorly sewn. It also ended up being not quite long enough even though the measurements indicated that it should in fact fit my window... Plus the bows are uneven on the ends and are fixed so that you cannot untie and retie them. I will have to return this. So sad because I really wanted the full set, but I worry about the quality on that as well.",0
"This seat is perfect! I have a boy and was having a rough time finding a over the toilet seat for him and this is the one. It has handles for holding on, the shield is right size and the no slip grip on the bottom keeps the seat steady at all times. I would recommend this seat to anyone it's so affordable and I'm glad I bought it!",1
"good clock overall. though I wish that you can also set up the picture and alarm for sleep. I got this clock to serve as a reminder for my daughter to go to sleep, hoping I can set up the alarm and the picture of a sleeping kid at a certain time so my child can go to bed early. Unfortunately, you can only set the alarm for wake up mode because when the alarm goes off, it only lights up the scooter girl playing. but overall, still very useful",0
"After using this thermometer on my 1 year old for about year, I find that it is impossible to get a consistent reading because she moves around so much.  Three different attempts can yield over a degree variance between them.  Even when using it on myself it bounces about by .2 degrees or so between readings.  I wouldn't recommend this for a small child, especially if they don't like to hold still.",0
"This is wonderfual to have in our van.  It has a larger sized mirror so I can view my baby.  He loves to watch the lights when it is on.  The music can be slightly annoying after a few minutes, but the nice thing is that you can just do the lights without music!",1
"During my cloth diaper trial period, GroVia definitely stood out above the rest. I really like that you only need 2 to 3 covers per day, while just snapping in new inserts with each diaper change. I started cloth diapering when my youngest was 8 months old. Not only did the GroVia fit him (and he is really tiny and petite) but it also fit my very chunky 2.5 year old. The covers dry easily and are not as bulky as other cloth diapers. My son has also had way less diaper rashes with GroVia! Being a hybrid diaper, there are so many options for diapering as your needs may change. I look forward to continuing our cloth diaper experience with GroVia for my current and future children!",1
"I bought the co sleeper when I was still pregnant and was hoping it would help me through the long nights with a new baby.  It didnt.  I have to agree with the previous review about the mattress.  It's as thin and hard as a rock and my daughter wont sleep on it, no matter how tired she is. She's more comfortable in her car seat!  It's also very difficult to get the side rail down. My husband nearly broke it trying to lower it and it seemed like with the side rail down the mattress slanted towards the front, making it even more uncomfortable for my daughter.A waste of $165 in my opinion.",0
"I just bought this and used it for the first time after six weeks of using the Medela Pump In Style. It is quicker, more comfortable, and got twice as much milk out than my other pump normally does. I did ten minutes on each side and had a full ounce more output than I did doing 15 minutes with the PIS. This was bought for travel and backup but I may end up using it all the time!",1
"I use one in the car seat, and one on the changing table.",1
"I loved this product at first (for maybe the first 2 weeks) until my son (now 11 months old) started wripping it off of the table edges. ONce it's ripped off, it does not stay back on well. I am looking into ordering mroe tape to try and restick them to the tables.",0
"I am a HUGE Disney fan. This quote was perfect for my childrens' playroom. I had a 1/2 of a wall of bare space next to a window, and didn't know what I wanted to put there. I have many different quotes all around the house so I have become a pro to these! I found this one on Amazon for a great price, and decided this would be perfect. It was so easy to apply to the wall - step by step directions were included. I have had absolutely no problems with it. It is on there and not going anywhere. I know from past experience that these vynl letters are easy to pick off when you are re-painting so I am not worried about that at all. I would definitely recommend this quote :) I love it.",1
"I have a 5 month old baby and this swing is her Kryptonite. She can't resist falling asleep to the gentle natures sounds and the smooth rocking. I got this swing from the my coworkers and I was so excited to get it. It took awhile for her to be able to use it (she was too small). But now, when I can't get her to nap in her crib, I put her in her swing and she goes right out. She loves the toys, and she will stay in it for a long time. I have recommended this swing to everyone I know. It's a definite MUST!",1
"I received this set as a gift in August and we had no problems with them until just this past month. The nipple now detaches very easily from the bottle cap and will let the milk drain out and soak my baby...at random. There is no breakdown or wear-and-tear to be seen, so I can only imagine it is poor engineering or cheap material. On another note - my baby had more gas than ever whenever we used these Ventaire bottles. I am definitely going to stop trying to get these to work, and move on and purchase another bottle type.It is 4 am and I've had two of the Ventaire bottles leak during a frustrating middle-of-the-night crying baby session. One soaked through two layers of clothes and so a clothes-change and sponge bath was added to this wonderful night.I will be doing whatever I can to contact Playtex and let them know how frustrating their product is...it's not like I can get my money back, but I will definitely be spreading the word about my disappointing experience with these bottles, and I will not be purchasing Playtex items in the near future.",0
"We have been using these car seats for awhile now.  We have two of them, one for our 2-year-old and one for our 4-year-old.  We love the RECLINE feature -- in fact, we use it so much, I don't know what we did before without it.  Well, wait, yes I do -- their poor little heads bobbed around and they got no quality sleep and woke up with stiff necks!Anyway, I just wanted to say that yes, they are big and heavy.  But I guess it depends on what your needs are.  We drive a minivan, so room isn't an issue like it is in a smaller car.  We don't fly, so don't need it for a plane.  And we don't have a need to move them often.  They are nice and secure -- the tightest fitting car seats we have ever owned -- and are very easy to install and remove.But, I will also mention that they are the most expensive car seats we have ever owned.  So, we do not have Britax experience to compare them to.",1
"I'm 8 month pregnant and decided to let my baby sleep in a Pack n Play since I have a small 1-bedroom apartment.  I really don't like the board that comes with my Graco Cuddle Cove PNP.  It's a thin board with some cushion that is too soft.  Since it's thin and fold-able, it does not stay well at the bottom of the bassinet and seems kind of bouncy because of its light weight.  After lots of research I decided to give this mattress a try.The mattress just arrived today and I'm very pleased with it. It measures 38x26 (The other Dream on Me mattress measures 38x24. That's probably why some reviewers stated that the mattress didn't fit their PNP. They didn't get the right one). The rounded corners of this mattress make it a perfect fit to the PNP, even better than the original board.  The mattress is made of polyurethane foam covered with plastic-like cover which makes it water-proof and very easy to clean.  There's no odor at all and although it says ""extra-firm"", it really is not that firm.  It's soft enough but provides sufficient support in my opinion. I'd give it 5 stars if it's a bit firmer.I also bought theAmerican Baby Company 100% Organic Cotton Interlock Fitted Pack N Play Sheet, Natural, which is very soft and comfortable, but too thin, stretchy and easily wrinkled. To make the mattress safer and free from hazards, I added a layer of cotton bath towel and usedThe ORIGINAL Bed Band. Adjustable Fastener/Holder/Strap/Suspender/Gripper for Your Sheets. Patent Pending.to make the cover more absorbent and tightly fitting (see photos).  I'm finally satisfied with my bassinet and can't wait to see my baby sleep in it.",1
"Pros: stays on when moving around, nice positioning for baby, adjustable strapCons: the back rest hurt my back a little bit, takes a little longer to get on than a simple Boppy",1
This clock has worked wonderfully in teaching our 21-month old when it's sleep time and when it's time to get up! Every morning and night we visually and verbally confirm the bunny's status and reinforce morning/wake up and nighttime/ bedtime. This is a great product as far as I'm concerned!,1
"This is a wonderful nursing cover that goes with me and baby everywhere.  I love the lightweight, adorable fabric and the wiring around the neck that allows me to look in at baby.  I can't believe I survived 2 previous nursing babies without this.",1
"This mobile is great and really does entertain the baby with the lights and movement. The one drawback to the one we received is the red unit does not seem to light as well as the others do. It ocassionally works as expected, but more often the not it simply light a the onset and then dims, never to be seen again....With the exception of the red unit the mobile is very entertaining and effective.",1
The RECARO Performance BOOSTER  was as advertised and is very safe but it is also very difficult and time consuming to get it buckled into the car. Which is why I only gave it two stars.,0
Attractive but the fabric is heavy and feels almost suede like. Every piece of lint/fuzz/hair seems to stick to it.,0
Covers the rail...keeps my baby from chewing paint chips.  Love the waterproof backing feature.  It's hard to buy things like this online without trying it on the crib but this fit PERFECTLY.  Make sure you measure your crib to make sure if this will be too big for it!,1
This brand is the only shoe I can actually keep on my baby's feet.  They fit nice and baby rarely tries to pull them off.,1
"When we started transitioning our daughter from a bottle to a sippy cup at 12 months old, we tried several brands. Our daughter seemed to do much better with the straw cups than the hard plastic lids. We like these cups because the straw folds down to keep it clean and prevent spills when not being used. The cups come in cute bright colors and are easy to clean. I am giving 4 stars only because a couple of the straws have had one of its ends get a little warped in the dishwasher. I would still recommended because the cups do not leak and are very easy for our daughter to use.",1
Big mirror that makes it easy to watch a baby in rear facingcarseats. Looks little big in small cars but who cares,1
"We purchased this carrier after returning the Ergobaby Original Collection Bundle of Joy Carrier as the Ergobaby carrier only allows baby to face inward. We wanted the comfort of the Ergobaby carrier design but the positioning options of the Babybjorn and this carrier does the trick. The other versions of the Babybjorn carriers are okay to wear for a short period of time however extensive/prolonged wearing is awful on the low back, I was very happy that Babybjorn created this comfort carrier as I can wear it for hours without any discomfort and baby loves it as well.",1
"I bought one of these in the past without problems, bought this one online expecting no problems as well but unfortunately the speaker is defective and does not play properly.  The baby loves it but I would have loved if it was fully functional.",0
"Though not very easy on the eye, it's very effective. Only down side is that if you have small hands like me it's hard to use. It also works better/easier to use on larger knobs. I'm just happy it works effectively!",0
The only issue I have is you need to make sure the pads stay moist.  They seem to dry up fairly quickly,1
"Sounds good and does exactly what we need it to do. Small, good noise quality, and portable. Not sure I could ask more from this device. My son seems to sleep much better with it! Love the night time crickets!",1
"I bought this to try with my cloth wipes. I did not like it at all. I made up the first batch and threw it away, I didnt even put it on my wipes. It was way too oily for me, I didnt want to put it on my kids! I also didnt like the smell at all. I just threw the bottle away. I think it's really just a matter of preference, but I went back to using my lil outlaw's rump solution.",0
These were exactly what I was looking for. They are just as pictured about the size of a softball. The stickers peel off the paper easily and stick well to clothing. I was able to re-apply the sticker a few times until it was where I wanted on her onesie without losing the stickynessIt's a throw way item that serves its purpose. I'd order again.,1
"I love this video monitor! I really like the music settings, and the picture for the video comes through perfectly clear. The base allows for easy positioning also. The only thing I don't like is the nightlight, which is orange. Otherwise, it's really perfect!",1
I purchased this shade after trying several others that had major suction cup issues.  I haven't had a single problem getting it to stick and stay on the window.  The suction cup at the bottom that holds the shade down is reliable and easy to stick/remove and it rolls up with the press of a button.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish it were wider...it still lets in sun on either side at certain times of the day.,1
"Cute and easy to wash. Great for my two-year old. The length won't work for too many more years, but it's great now.",1
"My kids and I love the Yummi Pouches. I have refused to buy the pre filled ones with applesauce because I make my own. Now I can use the Yummi Pouch and my kids think its fun to eat this way too. It is super easy to fill, I just use a scoop. The open part on the bottom makes them stand easily for filling as well and I love that they are dishwasher safe. The caps are easy to get off and I like that you can just order them separate in case they are lost.",1
"We love this bathtub.  We have the green one and the fuschia one for our boy/girl twins.  Since we only have a shower and no tub in our house, these tubs have been a lifesaver since the kids grew out of the infant tub.  They're easy to clean and very portable since they're so light when empty.  The kids love them.  They're the perfect size for toddlers.  And the styling is cool.  We have a pretty modern style bathroom and they ""go"" very well, not really ""babyish"".  We've had the first tub for almost a year now and it looks just as good as the one we orderd a few months ago, so they're quite durable.  I definitely recommend these tubs.",1
We bought this potty seat to take on long car rides and for camping. I simply bought a round wash basin (from the dollar store) and small waste paper garbage bags. And now we have our own portable potty anytime/anywhere.Just line the basin with the bags and place seat on top. I've even used it myself. When finished just tie a knot in bag and throw out. Simple. :),0
"We use both cloth diapers and disposables.  These covers are fab.  I actually got more leaks with the Costco/Kirkland brand diapers, actually we never had any leaks with the Bummis diaper cover at all.  My only complaint is that they were a little bulky.  My little boy looked like he had a humongous tush wearing these, but since these were the only covers I tried, I have nothing to compare them to.  They were pretty easy to keep clean.  I only bought 2 just to try them and would rinse off with soap and water and it would be dry by the next time I changed him.  Basically you don't need too many.",1
"I proudly boasted in a previous review that my cups didn't leak, we bought green and pink ones originally and still have no problems with them, but this darn purple one leaks when you just look at it! Cleaning them isn't a problem, we just put water in them anyway so nothing sticky leaks out and we use room temp water but it still leaks!",0
With very little usem the qater proof backing has peeled and leaks. They are unfit for use. I am very disappointed in this product.,0
"i bought this very expensive suction cup to keep my kids in the house.  i have a huge sliding glass door and there is no other way to childproof once they can unlock the doors.  my kids are 4 and 3 and still have not figured this one out, as long as it is above thier reach.  It has been banged, stepped on, chewed on, thrown by hubby (he hates it because he never remembers that it is there) and is still going strong.  If you have kids who are older than child-proof age, but still too short to reach it, this is the product for you!",1
I purchased this item as a baby shower gift.  It is very soft and will look great in the new baby room.,1
"I LOVE this pillow!  I purchased it as a birthday gift for my daughter's 3rd birthday.  My plan is for her to take it with her to daycare when she starts in a few weeks.  It's soft and the perfect size for a toddler (it is not a full size pillow) and my hope is that the lavender scent will help to calm her enough that she can sleep in her new setting.  We use lavender a lot at home, so I think the scent may comfort her.  I also love the ""pillowcase"" that comes with it.  It has holes for the head and feet and just covers the ""body"" or pillow part of the pillow.  This will make for easier cleaning.",1
"My 2yr old loves this backpack. We have been using it as our ""travel snack pack"", so it keeps her treats and books in it when we go somewhere. She knows after she gets her shoes and coat on that it is time to grab the snack pack and leave. Have gotten many compliments on it!",1
The glo-worm was a baby shower gift...it plays music for just the right amount of time to keep baby's attention....,1
"I bought this bedding set over a year and a half ago.  Initially I was very happy with the product, but over time I was disappointed.1.  The material is of poor quality.  Most of the material (the sheets, bumpers, quilt) gets small balls on it.2.  The bumper: a.) is a one piece bumper, making it difficult to fit it tightly to the crib. I definitely prefer a 4 piece bumper  b.) doesn't have enough ties, so it tends to sag.  c.)  ties are not sewn on well, I had to re-sew several onto the bumper.  d.)  appliques are not sewn on well, and they are falling off.3.  The diaper stacker is very flimsy and the decorative part at the top just tends to fold inward.4.  The toy bag is very flimsy and difficult to actually use as a toy bag.I just recently hung the 3 pictures, and they are holding up so far.  I have never hung the valances.  I have yet to use the quilt, but I imagine it will not hold up any better than the bumper after it is used for a while.  I have four children (one set of twins), and I bought two of these Geenny sets at the same time and both are falling apart after only a year and a half.  For my first child I bought a Cocalo bedding set.  It was just as expensive as the Geenny but came with less, but it is 2.5 years old and still looks great and is holding up very well.  I still have to buy a bedding set for my fourth child, and I'm looking at the Cocalo, Coco couture, or Coco & Company because I know the quality is much better.",0
Our babies always love MAM pacifiers most.  Each baby I try all different ones and they always go for the MAM.  But some of our babies have liked their pacis too much and end up with a bit of &#34;shark bite&#34;.  So happy to see this redesign to prevent just that!  Highly recommend this product!,1
"The product itself gets the job done, to a certain extent.  However, if junior grabs it, it can break.  Of course it is made of plastic, so don't be fooled.  You get what you pay for.  You're not buying a metal product.  Keep an eye on each lock for broken pieces, as they are a HUGE choking hazard.  Would I buy it again, probably.  It is cheap enough to have plenty around to re-lock which ever locks break.",0
The holder is pretty good. It doesn't stay on very tight. My 22mo old likes to pull it off and throw it on the floor. I am hoping when he is older and I can use it once he understands not to remove it.,1
I love the material! My son seems to love it also. Good quality materials and washes very well. Would recommend,1
"i love this bag, i got it because my friend had one, her had a strap. but i guess they don't come with it anymore so i added one it was really easy, now we use it as a all the time diaper bag, it hold so much: one shirt,pants or shorts, 2-3 toy cars, 3-4 diapers, some wipes, a small things of baby powder, snakes,Kleenex and that's just the inside, in the front pouch, it holds Disposable place mats, spoon and fork, bib. it can even hold more if i wanted to put more in, its great. we love it, even my husband uses it!",1
"My husband and I both use this baby carrier on a daily basis with our (currently) 7-week-old baby boy. (We starting using the carrier when he was about 2.5-weeks old.) The carrier is easy to put on and take off, and our boy loves snuggling next to us as we walk about or get some chores done around the house. It usually soothes him enough that he's off into dreamland within a few minutes, though sometimes he likes to just ""hang out"" in the carrier for awhile while we go about our daily activities. The carrier is well-made, durable, and cute.",1
Love love love this thing!! As far as some people saying the pillow turns brown. It's very light and if you resoak the pillow properly it goes away no problems. The refills are cheap. Doesn't dry out wipes like some people complain. Bought a second one to keep at grandmas house so my baby's fanny can stay warm everywhere we go!! Way cheaper here then in store!,1
"This was my favorite gift I recieved!!  It does not smell at all.  Plus, you can put your own bags in it.  I bought the cheap Wal-Mart bags, and throw them out in the big garbage can every couple of days.  Many people have commented on how my daughter's room never smells like dirty diapers.  I love it!",1
"We did my son in cloth diapers from birth through potty training - prefolds and covers, mostly pull on pants.  Cheap and effective.  Planned to do the same with my twin girls but at 10 months our drier died, I got snowed under with laundry and sucked into a 'sposie slump, and there was no going back.  Now pregnant with #4 and I want to do him in cloth the easier, hip, modern way - bought some BGs and Fuzzibuns one-size to use on my girls for now to figure out what I like.  Also waiting on some Flips...What I LOVE about these - It couldn't be easier.  Stuffing them takes more time than laying a bunch of prefolds flat but not nearly as much time as running to the store for diapers.  And getting them stuffed and stacked JUST SO soothes the OCD side of me (which you wouldn't know I had, to look around my house...)Getting them ON the baby is no more work than a disposable - no taking off shoes and pants to deal with pull on pants, no seperate cover, etc.  Fast and easy.Fairly trim.Wash very well - I got the snap ones as I know from past experience dealing with those velcro diaper snakes is NO FUN.  Every one complains about the velcro not holding up.  I can see it being more adjustable, but the snaps make for a nice appearance and will hold up well over time.  So far even on the pale green (sweet) cover, poo stains come out 100%.  The microsuade liners come pristine white each time and do not pill - they look amazing after several washes.They fit both girls - one is 29 pounds, one is 35-36.  Fuzzibuns one size are trimmer and maybe more fancy looking but do not fit my bigger girl and are tight on my smaller girl, whereas these on the biggest setting are comfortable on my bigger girl and on the second biggest fine on my smaller girl.  If you REALLY want a one size that will take you to potty training, these are better than fuzzibuns.  I suspect Fuzzibuns will be nicer/trimmer on a small baby, though.I am really hoping to have my girls trained by the time #4 arrives but I could have 3 in diapers for a while and these will take some of the sting out of that.Basically, love love love these diapers.Cons:PRICEY - never would have splurged like this before, but I figure I'm only doing this once more, I want to experience it all.  (And hopefully past 4.0 there won't be many ways to improve - seriously, how could they be better??? - so I can sell them and get a large portion of my $$$ back)Questionable on the absorbancy - they work pretty well for 2, slightly over 2 hours - but it can get dicey and I am still not convinced there's any way to beat a prefold for how much it will hold with how trim it is.  So for naps, or long trips out - depending on what changing capabilities will be like - If I can't change every 2 hours - I am sometimes more comfortable using prefolds.  I am still getting in the swing of not being able to go hours and hours in disposables...Take up a lot of room in a diaper bag - hence my wanting to try Flips, I suspect they will be easier to travel with, as well as more versatile.  Admittedly, travelling with these for ONE baby won't be as bad as for 2.  (But if I do end up with 3 in dipes at once, I may need to trade in my diaper bag for a carry-on bag with wheels LOL...)Elastic is supposed to be replacable but I don't know how yet - it's SUPER easy in the Fuzzibuns, seems more complicated in these.  But possible.  So they say.The SMELL...  look around and you will see complaints of SMELLS on these dipes.  I was using Charlie's Soap and I had stinky dipes.  Many moms admit to switching to Tide - gasp! a sin in the natural world - which I have tried - and it seems to help.  I am searching for the perfect way to combat the smell, something in between ""natural but doesn't work"" and ""never do that, you'll wreck your BGs!""  but the smell is not a big enough deal to not love these dipes.I don't see myself going 100% pocket dipes but I see myself reaching for these a lot.  Maybe 90%.  Trying to figure out the ideal number to have.  I really, really love them and wish I had gotten into them sooner.  But if I had, I probably would have gotten the velcro ones, and these are so much better - it's just as well.  Baby #4 is going to have some awesome diapers.(I don't realistically see myself going right in to these at birth though - newborn prefolds and prowraps covers are cheap and simple and IMO the best way to go with a newborn who poops a lot...  will likely start these around 2 months or so - can't wait!)",1
These are dish washer friendly and a perfect size for 3-5 Year olds. Most other cups I've found were too small or too large.My only criticism is they could have made them with a larger base instead of the extreme tapered design.,1
"I purchased this item for my 12 month daughter. She was just attempting to walk at the time. After doing much research I decided on the Jolly Walker due to its design and ability to add weight and pressure to back wheels preventing the child from tipping over. Well the design is wonderful but the construction is HORRIBLE.The rubber gaskets that line each wheel constantly fall off loosing all tracking on hard wood floors and sliding out from under the pressure of the child. I have now glued them in place several times in an attempt to prevent future slippage.Also the hardware used to attach the wheels to the body are of poor quality and under no time bent under duress.Those too I repaired twice and finally replaced with all new hardware.In essence, I have rebuilt this walker from the ground up. The only reason is because my daughter loves it so much and now 16 months still enjoys it.Also there is no customer service to be had or any viable way to contact the seller. The website provides an e-mail address which is non responsive, the phone number is outside the US. This makes returning the item, especially because it was purchased through Amazon, incredibly challenging.My summary;  a wonderful toy, better designed than most due to the thought that went into weight distribution but constructed in the worst manner. It should not bother you if you like to spend time in your workshop (I personally wan not planning on spending time in the workshop) other wise make sure you can purchase from a retailer that can facilitate returns easily and without hassles.",0
"Love this cup, though the lamb sound is softer than the other animal varities.  It appears to be light activated so the sound stops when you put the cup down.",1
"This does not stick, period! I've never written a review before and had to come just to warn you to save your money. We've tried everything it will not stay up, even when we emptied all the toys out. It's frustrating and dangerous, once it fall off the wall and onto my daughters head. Save your self the hassle.",0
"When I was pregnant I researched cloth diapers the entire 9 months and decided to make up my stash of the following:-Prefolds/covers for newborn stage (first 2 months primarily, but still use occasionally because Rumparooz also makes covers with awesome colors and prints; I also use Flip covers which are really good)-Pocket diapers: Best started fitting my baby when she was a good 8-9lbs. I mostly own all the versions that BumGenius makes as well as Rumparooz. I've recently purchased a couple more Rumparooz G2 because they are just that great.I have both the Aplix(hook and loop) and snaps versions. Naturally snaps typically last longer, but I think it's good to have a couple Aplix versions for dads, sitters, grandparents, overnight use, and quick on-the-go. And the aplix is really sturdy and well made. Always line-dry these diapers for extended longevity.What I love: Inner gussets contain explosive poo quite well. The interior and exterior material are well made; the included 6R soaker is microfiber. The fit is perfect and trim (a little low rise, but I like the look). My baby is now about 10lbs, so she is still using the newborn soaker pad, but occasionally I'll add the 2nd soaker and the fit is still nice and unobtrusively bulky.It's pricey, but you almost always get what you pay for. I highly recommend this diaper!",1
"We looked everywhere for something warm for our son that allowed him to move around as he likes to do while sleeping. The zipper zips to the bottom so my son can't unzip it at night. And, it has plenty of room for him to kick around inside of it. He is 26"" inches and 17 pounds and the medium fits great with plenty of room. This was the best sleeping outfit for cold weather as we keep the room pretty cold at night. He seems really comfortable in it.",1
"Although I am not that much of an urban mom, I suffer from arthritis and cant use hands and shoulders well. I wanted a easy to maneuver, light weight stroller that would also keep my child comfortable.  This stroller is exactly that.  Awesome functionality, looks and ease all in one!We need 2 hands to open the stroller but need only one hand to close the stroller and a little kick with the leg to lock it in standing position.  It is so easy to carry up and down the stairs.Our baby is still an infant and we use the graco car seat adapter with the graco infant car seat, our baby seems so comfortable and loves the strolls we take with her.  We got the orange stroller, but with the car seat, all the fancy looking part is gone and it looks very skeltal.",1
"The curtains looked better online. When I put them up, they were limp and looked as though they were missing something. They were not a good purchase to be used on their own.",0
"Its perfect for little amounts of milk, has the perfect size, easy to clean and the most important thing, is reusable.",1
We use this sunshade on our Phil and Teds Sport model - takes a minute to get it set up but works excellent.  Especially for loong periods out in the sun - covers your child completely.  The canopy on the Phil and Teds is not great so anytime were going to be in the sun for a period of time I put it on. I also purchased the Protect A Bub backseat/tandem cover - again takes a min to set up but great su protection!,1
These little scrubbers were just what I needed to clean straws for sippy cups and the fact that they stand up nicely is a plus too.,1
I didn't think my daughter would like this but she loved it!  She needs it on every night.  The only thing is the on/off button is a little difficult to reach because it's kind of tucked inside the unit at the bottom so my husband needs to use a toothpick or a pen to turn it on/off.,1
"I looked all around for the right monitor. Ive been using this for 8 months and it has worked perfectly. I have left the camera on 24/7 with no issues or wearing out. Picture is great, the night vision is clear, good sound and range! Im able to go outside around the yard and get things done while dd sleeps. Ive even dropped the receiver a few times on cement and no damage! Its an amazing product at an unbeatable price considering some are asking for twice this amount!",1
My 7mnth old always gets fascinated with this toy coz of it's bright colors and from the day he has started holding objects this is one of his favorite rattle.I always keep it in my diaper bag so engaging him during diaper changes gets easier!,1
"We shopped around for car seats and strollers, and opted for the Orbit system for everything.  It's been a great decision, and we are completely satisfied with all of the products so far.  This car seat is a little large, but considering it will fit our child for a few years. it's worth it.  Also - it works well without the Orbit Car Seat Base that's used with the infant car seat.  Great product, great value.",1
The warmer appears to take longer than the recommended times in the instructions to warm up bottles. I think this warmer would be ideal during later stages of feedings when baby has more of a routine but is difficult to use when you have to wait 6+ mins for a small bottle to heat up for late night feedings of infants whom are not on any set schedules.,0
I gave this as a gift and my friend had her baby' pictures taken with it.  It looked pretty natural!  ha ha ha,1
"This is a very cute way to keep track of my two year old. We just got it today. However, I am very disappointed to see that the front clasp on the harness doesnt stay closed. I dont know if this is faulty craftmanship or what but not happy that now I have to go through the trouble and mail it back.Update: after spending 10.70 to return the faulty item priority mail I received another one as requested. The one that was sent to me has a clasp that has the same piece on each side. It is impossible to close. I dont know where this seller got their product but this is ridiculous. I wont purchase from them again.",0
"My daughter absolutely loves these flashcards! I have 3 different sets and rotate sending different ones to daycare with her. Since day one these have held her attention almost as well as my face. She's even cried before if I took them away before she was bored with them. They're extremely beautiful too! I just wish more came in one set, especially for the price.",1
Bought for twin grandboys! Mama only have so many hands this is a wonderful idea must have been designed by a mom.,1
"Lightweight, easy to install, easy to get in and out of the car, attractive... yes yes yes.  BUT, There is improvement needed on this model.FIRST  The infant insert is of a terribly scratchy unnatural material... yuck.  It irritated my newborn's skin horribly.  We took it out and used a different insert instead, which the manufacturer does not recommend doing.ALSO  There is white piping that comes across the back on the inside of the cover (it's under the newborn insert in the picture and you can't see it).  It's bumpy and protrudes out from the cover.  When your baby is big enough to remove the insert, the piping is right at the back of the head, on the part that sticks out the most.  My baby got a big red spot there where that piping was rubbing on her all the time.ALSO  For the life of me I can't figure out how to remove the cover without taking apart the seat.  I must assume then that this cover is not washable.  My darling girl had a big blow out poop all over her seat, and I can only wipe it off (yuck).ALSO  It would be nice if the seatbelt part could be pulled out just 1 or 2 inches more, because then you could have them open and use 2 hands to put your child in the seat.  As it is now, they keep flopping back into the seat before I can get her into it, and she ends up sitting on them and then I have to dig them out from under her to buckle her in.  This is a pain and a real drawback and has woken up my little girl more than once.  And it is terribly uncomfortable for her.Chicco, you can do better. Small improvements can make a big difference in our lives.",0
"This thing seemed like the greatest idea but... i was sorry to find out that it didn't help me get comfortable during  my pregnancy.  I was middle pregnancy and using lots of individual pillows worked better to support my belly and hips.  I'm pretty average height and weight (5 ft 7, 160 lbs max during pregnancy) so I don't think it was size related.  My husband also couldn't fit in our full size bed when this thing was there! I gave it away after trying it for a few weeks.",0
"******************DO NOT BUY THIS******************** one of the bugs got lodged in my 5 month old daughters mouth between the roof of her mouth and behind her bottom gums as it twisted round once in her mouth and took alot of fauce to disslodge it, it is not safe and all made should be recalled and no more made!!so annoyed and this should of not passed checks",0
i'VE USED IT TWICE NOW ON TRIPS AND i CAN SAY THAT i AM THE ENVY OF OTHER PARENTS WHO DRAG THEIR CAR SEATS ON TO THE PLAN. Although my daughter is not quite happy about it - it works and keeps her safe:),1
I thought this was the Pearhead album that fits any size photo - but it is not.,0
My son loves putting the shapes into the ball.  He has a hard time opening the ball and getting the shapes back out but that will come with time as he has only just turned 2 years old.  This is the kind of toy that he keeps coming back to.  He can't quite get all the shapes in on his own and he loves the challenge.  He will put it aside for a while then pick it back up again in time to discover he can fit even more shapes on his own.  I am so glad they did not make any changes to this classic toy.,1
I used the diaper genie with my first two children and hated how hard it was to use and how expensive it was to refill.  The diaper champ is now out and I have used it with my third baby.  It is wonderful...so much easier and more cost efficient.  Don't waste money on the diaper genie.  One $10 box of trashbags will fill the diaper champ us as long as your baby is in diapers!!,0
These bottles work much better than regular feeding bottles. I wish I new about these sooner (would have saved my baby a few days of suffering from gassy stomach).,1
"This product worked great for about 6 months, then, as others have noted, it started getting whacky. It wouldn't turn off and I would have to un-plug it to turn it off. Now, it turns off randomly and since my daughter is so used to sleeping with the white noise, she wakes up when it turns off. Complete waste. DO NOT purchase this cheap, worthless product.",0
"This bottle was a lifesaver when my youngest daughter refused any bottles!  I was exclusively breastfeeding, but was in school 2 nights a week.  This was the only bottle my daughter would take.  Some people talk about it being messy, but it's especially simple for breast milk.  You heat the milk, put a clean finger over the nipple, turn it over, pour the milk in and screw the bottom on.  We never really had issues with it being messy.  I HIGHLY recommend this item!  I also think it would be good if someone is unable to breastfeed in the hospital for some reason.  May help with nipple confusion! [...]",1
"Bought this to replace """"nature's touch"""" cradle swing (inner mechanism that makes swing move broke) ... my son is ~15 lbs and the swing won't even move him ... two sets of fresh batteries didn't help ... thought I'd buy the slightly cheaper swing as he doesn't spend too much time in one anymore ... next time I'll just spend the $",0
"This is the only pacifier that my little girl will take. Not only is it drop dead adorable, but she loves the nipple on it!",1
"As a piece of nice-to-have equipment when babysitting, the &#8220;Fisher-Price Spacesaver Cradle &#8216;N Swing&#8221; is an good choice for Grandma&#8217;s house.  Unlike the Power Plus model of Fisher-Price&#8217;s Spacesaver Cradle &#8216;N Swing, this unit operates solely on batteries and its cost, on Amazon, is $34 lower.The unit, as with most Fisher-Price products, is made well and is nicely finished.  There are no rough edges on the plastic pieces; assembly is easy and quick.  The various swing speeds and the sound options are desirable features.The fabric seat cover is soft and removes for washing &#8211; always a necessity.  It is nicely padded and a three-point harness adds a safety factor.Although this Spacesaver unit is not quite as large as Fisher-Price&#8217;s standard cradle and swing models, it is not especially compact.  The footprint on regular cradle and swings is approximately 31&#8221; X 28&#8221;.  The footprint of the &#8220;Fisher-Price Spacesaver Cradle &#8216;N Swing&#8221; is approximately 31&#8221; X 17&#8221;.  The triangle design creates a stable base and is the reason the footprint can be smaller than other versions of the cradle and swing. The crossbar at the top of the &#8220;Fisher-Price Spacesaver Cradle &#8216;N Swing&#8221; made it somewhat awkward to lift our little one out of the cradle.  The difference in the height of the two units was not a significant factor in the decision with respect to the unit to purchase.While the Fisher-Price web site states the &#8220;Fisher-Price Spacesaver Cradle &#8216;N Swing&#8221; may be used until your little one &#8220;attempts to climb out of the product&#8221;.  I would not recommend using it once the infant becomes more physically active, let alone until they attempt to climb out of the swing.Further, although this is rated for infants who weigh up to 25 lbs., the unit does not work well for children over 20 lbs.  Battery life decreases with increasing weight and/or swing speeds; your actual experience will also vary depending on how extended the period of use is.  While you can plug in the Power Saver unit, I found this feature less than appealing.  It meant that the Cradle &#8216;N Swing had to be located near an outlet &#8211; and, that other individuals had to take care not to trip over the cord.Some individuals may prefer the muted, earth-tone colors of this Spacesaver model.  They will not stimulate your little one and will not clash with most d&eacute;cor.  I thought the color palette was not particularly fun or engaging for little ones.  The two animal figures on this unit are muted in color and are not easily distinguishable for infants whose ability to focus has not developed.  They cannot be removed.If you are looking for a nice cradle &#8216;n swing that is less costly than many of Fisher-Price&#8217;s models, you may want to consider their &#8220;Fisher-Price Spacesaver Cradle &#8216;N Swing&#8221;.",1
"This blanket is not as vibrantly colored as pictured.  It is also falsely represented by saying it is 40""x40"".  The blanket is 40x30.  It also says on the blanket that it is made in China, not the USA like it is said here.  I am not happy with the product especially for this price (it is $5 cheaper with free shipping on sarahssilks.com).  With all this said, it is an adorable blanket.  I only wish it was as represented.",0
I ordered this for my Grandson! My daughter said it is adorable !It is quite a light show for him !! EXCELLANT purchase !,1
"The brand and the quality is very good, the child is love, not all the food, very perfect designgood",1
I really don't use this is a nursing pillow.  I use it to prop up my baby.  Right now she is 2 months so it's great to lay her in it to watch me cook or do chores.  Later she can use it for tummy time and when she can sit up.  There are so many ways to use this pillow.  It's bigger than a boppy pillow too.  So if you want to breastfeed I recommend a smaller pillow this one was too bulky to use for nursing.  Too hard but a good hard for baby when they want to lay or sit in it.,1
"6.5 y/o (40 lbs) daughter got into it by herself and absolutely loved it.2.5 y/o (30 lbs) son needed a little help getting on but eventually got the hang of it.clips to secure child on to the carrier looks sturdy enough (albeit made of plastic) i doubt it will hold if the child actually jumps off (probably there only to maintain stability).weight is distributed mainly on both shoulders, wore it around the house carrying my son for about 15 minutes with no problem.may write a follow up review after going hiking.only complaint is it's already made in china.",1
"I have the 8 oz size bottles and absolutely love them. However, the labels and measurement labels on the side of the bottles slough off and I find it sometimes in my daughter's mouth and hands! I wonder if it is toxic. Now it is difficult to see how much formula I am making. Other than that, works great.",1
"Just what I wanted...set up was simple, it's sturdy and fits snugly in the doorway.  Looks good and works well",1
"After reading &#34;Happiest Baby on the Block&#34;, I was definitely swaddling my children. With my first son (now 19 months), we used the Halo Sleep Sack Swaddles...they were okay.  I had to sew the arm pieces because my son could get his fingers through the hole which compromised the whole swaddle itself.  We used these for several months but weren't thrilled with them.  For my second son (now 2 months) we bought the Miracle Blanket.  The Miracle Blanket is WONDERFUL!  Yes, it is a baby straight jacket, but for those who are pro-swaddle, it is worth every penny.  My only complain is that my baby is very long and at times, when he wiggles his legs, his knee catches the leg cover and pulls it down. Don't hesitate on buying this...heck, buy two or three!",1
"I bought this for our newborn, who is due here in July 2014. But in the meantime I've been using it for our 23 month old. She LOVES it. There are actually times when she throws a tantrum because she doesn't want to get out after the diaper change is done. I've even gotten in the habit of throwing it on the couch and putting her on it when she falls asleep in my arms during the day.Other aspects that I like are that the bottom is made of a good no-slip grip material, which was important to me because we're using it on a linoleum counter. We've only had it for a month or so, so I can't speak to it's durability.",1
"I am in love with this pillow!  With my third baby I was looking for a better solution to the bath time situation.  In the past I used one of those hard plastic tubs, but was tired of storing it in our tiny bathroom.  A friend suggested this and it is perfect for us.I saw some other reviews said it floats on the water - that is not how this works. It is essentially a pillow - filled with stuffing.  You just put it in the tub and then fill with as much water as you wish.  It is a little puffier in the back to keep the babies head out of the water.  I personally like to put a lot of water in the tub, so I just folded up a little hand towel and shoved it under the head to give her a little more of an angle.  We hang it to dry over the tub and have never had a problem with mildew.  I have thrown it into the washer a few times just to be on the safe side.It worked beautifully with an infant laying down AND for an older baby once they start sitting up but aren't balancing well.  We've used it for a year now and I have no complaints!",1
"I bought this for my grandson's 1st birthday, he wouldn't set it down,and when he did he picked it right back up again! So Adorable! The diningset is very sturdy, he dropped it many times (more than 15) and it didn'tbreak and there are no nicks or anything its still perfect and it washesup nicely. He loves Elmo and he loves this! It passed his thumb inspectionand everything! I am so glad I bought this, I love to see his beautifulsmile and smile he did! Can't ask for much more than that!",1
"This smells so horrible and toxic. It does not go away either. I sat my 3month old in it and she loved it, but after only 5 minutes I had to change all of her clothes because she smelled so strong of the foam smell. It just can't be healthy, it smells up the whole house and just won't go away. Contacted company to try and find out what was in the foam, and no response. Going back today! DON'T BUY IF YOUR CONCERNED ABOUT STRONG TOXIC SMELLS THAT MAKE YOUR CHILD WREAK!",0
I bought 2 of these as a birthday gift for our 3 and 1 year old. They LOVE them and I think they are super cute. They are actually rather comfy and big. Our 3 year old is the size of a 6 year old and there is still plenty of room for her to grow and still be comfy in these.,1
Finally sippy cups that really don't leak at all and my kids really like them.  No more having to worry about sticky floors or slippery ones,1
"This product didn't have fantastic reviews, so I hesitated. I am happy to say that I love this product and so does my baby! We use it nearly every time we put him down and it does the trick! It is a little loud when batteries are fresh, but it has never bothered our little one and he's a light sleeper. I would and do recommend this product.",1
We are teaching my toddler the importance of washing hands and along with a foot stool this makes it easier for him to reach the water.,1
"This product is wonderful and has kept our munchkin perfectly toasty since we got it for her last month.  However, it CANNOT be overstated how HUGE the sizes are.  After reading some reviews that mentioned the large size, we bought the 12-18 month size for our average sized 18 month old.  It would easily fit her 3 year old brother!  IT STILL WORKS WELL, it just billows around her ankles when she walks in it.  I would still buy it again, though, because it does what I need it to do, which is keep her warm without twisting in loose blankets.",1
If you're traveling with young children this product is an absolute must!  We used to drag the car seat onto the plane.  What a pain.  this product is so easy to use and fits in a big pocket or small bag.  Kids are safe and big bulky car seats are checked or left home!  Period.,1
"I have two cats, one of whom only eats soft food. Because I don't feed her the complete contents of a can of food eveyr day, I have some left over. I was storing the leftover in the refrigerator in plastic bags to maintain freshness but the bags always split. I acquired this product through Amazon's Vine program hoping it would be a more permanent, or at least less waste-producing, solution.Thus far, after a few weeks using it, the reusable bag seems to work well. The food retains its softness, smell and freshness even though the bag seems to me to be quite porous -- not making an airtight seal and, thus, allowing air to come in. But the results contradict that; the food inside stays soft, smelly and fresh and the bag seems to work well for my purpose.This particular bag is not large and may work as a perennial baggie for your school child's lunch, depending on what you load into it. It measures 7 X 6.5 X 1 inch(es) and might not accommodate two regular slices of bread and filler. Even if it did, it would be a tight fit. This product would be better for that if it were another inch wider and deeper.If you ship your kids off to school with something like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, it would likely be a mess all the time too. You can turn it inside out and wash it but, to me, this seems like some bother.Having said that, I repeat this product works fine for my purpose (thus far) even though I had grave doubts it could fulfill my requirements. Perhaps then it can meet your requirements too. For people interested in aesthetics, the brightly colored bag is probably appropriate for elementary school children. My cats don't seem to mind one way or another as long as their food is fresh. And it is, every day.",1
"Very pleased with quality and overall appearance of the sleepsack. It is a bit large, but baby will grow and it is roomy enough to kick little legs.",1
I have always used evenflo glass bottles and loved them.  But recently I ordered these and they have been breaking very easily.  Even while hand washing them.  Not safe around kids - when they break the shatter.,0
"I took my 5 month old daughter to a toy store to """"test drive"""" various Activity Centers.  There were pink cars and three-in-ones and walkers.  She LOVED this one.  In the store she just sat there for almost 15 minutes and when I finally took her out she fussed to go back!  It has been four months of daily use.  My house has never been so clean and my family is well fed for the first time since her birth. Her legs are stronger and standing on her own.  She has figured out all the bells and whistles and knows how to get all the songs to play.  She seems so proud of her self.  We call it her """"office"""" and she is happily """"working"""" right now while I peacefully right this review.  It is so great my parents got one for their house too!  It folds easily and assembly is a snap.  She has banged and torn at it and no problems at all!",1
"I was a little skeptical about spending so much money on a pump, but knew that I needed a good one before my return to work. This pump is wonderful! The bag makes it easy to transport and kind of discreet. The pump itself is very effective and quiet, which was a major concern of mine. I don't have a bad word to say about it.",1
"i cant recommend this nail filer, it just didnt work for us... it seemed to just bend my daughter's nails and took soooo long for just one nail! imagine holding a newborn's (or a baby's) fingers for that long. i was afraid i would cut her skin with the baby nail-clipper & thats why i bought this. well, i actually found the nail-clipper much easier to control and WAY quicker... my daughter is 14 months old and i have never nicked her.",0
my daughter loves this product she's always running around in it I love it is well just that the side mirrors on the Walker are able to pop off easily beside that 1 thing is product is great,1
"Our family was so excited to have received the item a week ago.  My wife was so happy that now she could make puree and all kinds of blending foods for our 6 months old boy. We like it that we can cook then blend in the same machine.  No need to use separated pot to boil veggies... However, the excitement didn't last long. Up to day fifth of usage, the Cook mode decided not to work anymore. We tested the blending mode and it's working fine. Pondering on what might have happened, we troubleshot with the manual, but didn't get any luck. I went online to find the manufacture help phone number.  Understandable that no one would work on a Sunday, I left a voicemail.  Luckily, I found the manufacture on Facebook, left them a message along with my contact info on there as well.  Next day, there was a reply on FB, asking us to call the customer service phone number. We thought that instead of replying to us, they should take the time and pass along our message to the customer service department, then they can take the initiate to contact us.  Something they should have done when their product is the one that in question here. But we called again anyway, figuring out that their CS department is probably too busy to listening to voicemail or getting in touch with their FB friends.  Still no one answered the phone. Left another voicemail.  Still no one to return the call. It gets to the point that we would need to send it back.  Too bad Amazon doesn't have the option for replacement, just plain refund. Wasting money. Disappointing customer service. Highly not recommend this product to anyone",0
"I was given this sleep sack as a gift and thank goodness for it every day . At first I was concerned because it looks quite warm but my son simply won't sleep in anything else (and I've tried everything from receiving blankets to the miracle blanket, to halo and summer infant sacks nothing else keeps him happy). I only hope the next size up will continue to work my son is 2 months old and is too big for this product (he's used it since he was 2 weeks old).",1
"Good use and will last us awhile. The potty itself is awesome and portable. Together, a great tool to keep in the car.",1
"The item was shipped promptly.  I was very disappointed with the quality of the product.  I purchased it for my son's crib and was shocked to see pink dots on the reverse pattern.  No where in the picture or description did it indicate that there were pink dots. It was for a second crib in the basement so I wasn't going to return it.  I went ahead and washed the entire set because I always launder items that touch the skin before use.  I followed the care instructions.  Now I don't know if the washing shrunk the bumper a bit, but it did not fit around the perimeter of the crib.  I was unable to return it because the company does not accept laundered items.  Also I did see the review that said that the bumper was not well padded, well that was an understatement.  The bumper offers NO protection and it kept slumping.  I had to go to Target to purchase another bumper that would closely coordinate.  Let me save you aggravation, the item is not worth its ""original"" price.  I feel sorry for those that actually paid that amount.  I also think it is not worth its sale price either.  Go to Target and purchase the DwellStudio line.  The Target near me had a decent selection.  You may end up spending a few dollars more for the same items but the quality is superior.  I normally don't write reviews but I was compelled to write this one because I know how expensive children's items are and I don't want some one else to be disappointed the way I was.",0
We LOVE this seat because of the LATCH system.  It stays on the seat!  Plus my 4 year old things it is really soft and comfortable.  There is a lot of padding.  It is really well made....you can tell it is high quality right when you take it out of the box.  Very well designed and made.  I highly recommend this backless booster seat!,1
"Excellent storage bottles (and BPA free), but wish you could purchase these without the nipples and nipple caps which we did not want or need.",1
"I have been using this product for about 1.5 months now and love it.  It is easy to put on and allows me to do other things while pumping and helps the time to pass faster.  I followed the size chart and it fits perfectly which I always worry about buying online and not being able to first try-on.  I am a 38 D and got the large.  If you are worried about fitting I know they sell them in Motherhood, though you may not be allowed to try it on.  I use a Medela Pump in Style and the breastshields stay in place the whole time.  I have completely filled the bottles that I was pumping into and still didn't have to worry about anything falling off or moving around.  You do have to put the breastshields in from the inside first, then zip up the bra, and then attach the other pieces.  To remove I ""pour"" any leftover milk in the flange into the bottle then remove the connectors.  I then push a tissue though one flange so that milk doesn't come out while I am removing.  I repeat on the other side.  It sounds complicated but it takes me seconds and I don't have any spillage.  The material is cotton and pretty thick, not flimsy.  I haven't tried any others to compare it to, but overall I highly recommend it to anyone that has to pump often.",1
"I am a new mom of 8 week old triplets!  When I found out about these I thought they would be really good for the times when you cant give each baby all your attention.  They work better than just a plain pacifier but I think they will work a little better once the babies are a bit older.  My sister in law gave me a dog one and I think the weight of that one works a little bit better.  They are easy to clean, since we do a ton of laundry I just throw them in the wash but not the dryer.",1
It took my baby a couple tries before she began to like being in the wrap but once she began to like it Mommy had her life back! I was finally able to get dishes done and some chores as I carried her with me around the house. I chose this over other wraps because it is so much easier to put on (less fabric to mess with). I only gave it 4 stars because after 30 minutes my back does start to ache and my baby is only 12 lbs. But if your on the market for a wrap you should defiantly consider this one!,1
"my granddaughter loved it she used it till she could walk, even after that she played with the toys that was attached.",1
"The old one worked great!. We steered many people to using the odl Diaper Champ. We gave many as baby shower gifts. When we had our last child we thought we would buy the new model. It was horrible. It did not seal as well as the old one so unless you took great care to leave it perfectly aligned it would smell horribly. Also, taking loaded bags out of the new model was hard. It would snag on some of the innards sometimes ripping bags.If you can find the old model... I would buy that. I tried to tell Baby Trend about the issues with the new model... but they did not care. I used to love Baby Trend, however after my experience with their customer service regarding this model.... I have sworn them off. In fact I did not want to steer any traffic to them. However, if you can find the original designed model... I would try that. It worked GREAT for us and many many of our family/friends.",0
"I bought a BOB with the car-seat attachment hoping I would only need one stroller that did it all - birth through late toddler.  The BOB is a huge, urban assault type stroller.  An ""SUV Escalade"" of strollers if you will.I should have bought this right away.  This is light, compact, fits in the back of any small car and also would fit into a large luggage if traveling.  You could get this on and off a city bus.  It will save your back and neck hauling your small child around in their car seat into restaurants, malls, etc.This is NOT for long urban walks if your city is like mine - uneven pavement, patches of no pavement at all and no curb-cuts, various debris and pot-holes.  I still need the BOB for long walks & off-road trails.  So, I now have 2 strollers.  Probably will end up with an umbrella stroller for travel later as well.",1
"Bought this car seat for my 2.5 year old to give her more leg room to rear face longer. (NHSTA recommends until your child turns 4: [...]). She was complaining in her previous car seat about being ""stuck"". The Pria gives her plenty of leg room (she mostly sits ""criss cross.."") and she loves how it feels. It also gives her more of a view out of the car. It was relatively easy to install. The only issue we had was moving the LATCH strap from forward facing position to rear facing position. You have to undo the car seat cover and move the strap down (not in the manual). Once we figured it out, the install went well. The fabric feels like neoprene and there is plenty of cushion. She fell asleep in the car seat the first week, which she had not done in months. This is a good option for anyone looking to ERF.",1
"Adorable! Smaller than I expected, but still a cute gift. Shipped quick.",1
"We purchased these wooden play eggs for our almost 3 year old daughter to go with a wooden toy mixer. She plays with these every day and loves counting them, tapping them gently on the edge of the bowl before pretending to break them open into the mixer bowl. We love this simple, well made toy. We try to purchase toys that develop a child's imaginative play without the use of electronics / sounds. Our toddler loves to pretend to cook eggs, carry them around and take them in and out of the carton. They are very nice quality and lightweight. They feel to be similar size and weight to real eggs. The only worry I have is that the carton will get flimsy over time. (Which could easily be replaced with a sanitized, clean,  real egg carton cut to size.These are smooth well sanded eggs with no sharp edged pieces and no harmful painted surface that could peel or chip off. I like that they are wood and not plastic as often plastic items give off fumes. I like that this is a USA company and well trusted source. They are also large enough that we don't have to worry about choking hazards. As stated in the description (I myself have not measured) each egg is 2.5&#34; long and 1.75&#34; diameter. Good Eggs is a set of six (6) wood eggs in a recyclable egg container. The company is Camden Rose. We purchased these and may purchase another set as well in the near future.",1
"Great quality, beautiful design. All over, I'm extremely pleased with this product. It was expensive but so far I think it was worth it",1
"I got this for my daughter, our first child, after watching several YouTube stroller reviews by baby gizmo. Nine months later I'm still in love. It fits in our trunk when collapsed (we have a roomy trunk with the ford fusion). I love that I can face baby toward me and didn't have to pay $800. Also this is great for newborns as the basket golds completely flat, and the fabric cover that goes over the snack tray created a bassinet type environment.  It's also very roomy. My daughter is nine mos old and I still have the fabric cover up.  This is in my top 5 for must have baby items!!",1
"I got the swing in and it is very study and durable. Haven't gotten my son to install it yet, but it seems to be the same quality as a playground swing. Only complaint (small one) is that the material is very thick - feels hard, not pliable, but it will probably last longer because of this.",1
"We&#8217;ve been using the 900 MHz analog Summer monitors for about five years with pretty good success, so I was looking forward to checking out this new generation. While moving from analog to digital signal introduces some new functionality, it takes a big step backward in one important aspect: smoothness of the video feed.With the 900 MHz analog system, watching our child was like watching television. You could pick up on the subtlety of movement. In our case, this is very important, as our son has seizures. With this digital system, however, it was more like watching a webcam over the Internet, even though the signal isn&#8217;t leaving your house. The motion was like a silent movie. It looked like 15 fps compared to the analog system&#8217;s 30 fps.The speaker on the monitor was also very weak. It was very hard to hear what was coming across, especially compared to the very loud and clear analog system.Being able to use the remote displays on battery was a nice feature, although the batteries seem to go dead weather you are using them or not.The new on-screen display of signal strength was pointless.I tested both the Wide View and In View systems, and didn&#8217;t feel the Wide View was worth the extra cost. Yes, it was a wide view, but because it was showing a wider area, it showed less detail. I was also underwhelmed by the digital zoom (as I&#8217;ve usually been by digital zoom on almost any camera).For my purposes, and compared to the earlier generation, I feel this product rates about two stars. However, I&#8217;m giving it three, since it seems to function as designed. That said, I find it to be a very flawed design.",0
Best thing I ever bought!!!!!!!I used these for the first week or so and it was 1000 times better then with the nipple cream.,1
"My wife really loves this, and chose it over the Boppy.  She liked it because it has the added back support and likes it a lot.  The one problem I had with it is the construction of the padding under the cover.  When we took it out of the bag it came in, it smelled like straight gasoline!  We decided to give it a try, and removed the cover and aired it out a little for a few days.  It subsided and was MUCH better.I think it has to do with the glue they use to put together the padding under the colorful cover, and the put it in the plastic display packaging before it has the chance to air out properly.  Either way, it works great after we got the smell off of it.  We are very particular about using clean and hypoallergenic items for the baby, so we would not have kept it unless we felt it was safe.I would recommend this to a friend, but I would also recommend they air it out before having it around kids.",1
My daughter has never used a binky!! She loves these. I think they are helping with the uncomfortable feeling with teething. She definitely chomps on them. She loves them. She is 14 months old.,1
"I belabored this choice for weeks, going back and forth between Medela and Ameda because of the ""closed"" vs. ""open"" debate.  But this pump is great!  I never thought I'd love a pump so much but the portability, convenience, and functionality of the PIS makes my life so much easier.Pros:*Powerful.  I used an Ameda and Medela hospital pump for three weeks before purchasing this one and I cannot tell the difference with respect to power.  My milk production has not decreased at all.*The car adapter and battery pack are great features when in a pinch.*The tote is nondescript and roomy with exterior side pockets.  It fits many extras in the main compartment (e.g. hands-free bra, stopwatch or iphone w/app, books, Lansinoh cream, nursing pads, etc. ) It's also nice while pumping at home...I can easily tote the pump around with baby in tow, carrying all of my essentials inside.*No condensation in tubes here since continuing to run pump for a few minutes after pumping sessions that produce condensation.*Comes with four bottles and 12-hour ice pack that also serves as a bottle holder inside an insulated pouch.Cons (both minor):*Continuing to run the pump for a few minutes after each session can feel a bit tedious at times, but I've not had a condensation-related problem yet. However, this is a very minor complaint as I don't have to do this every time; only when I see condensation forming.*I wish there weren't holes at the tops of the bottles.  But I have yet to actually spill any milk, I just worry about doing so.I hope this helps!****UPDATE: I have been using this pump daily for one year. It still seems just as powerful as when first purchased, and I have not had any issues with mold.  Condensation does appear after pumping, but I've continued to run the pump for a few minutes (until fog is gone), and the tubes have remained clear.",1
"Not much more to say than the title, my little girl just isnt intested in these cute bath toys. Too bad.",0
"This nipple seems appropriate for the ages suggested, 3-6 mos.  My son has no trouble latching onto it - he previously used AVENT bottles when he wasn't nursing, but then I learned of BPA and we switched.  The anti colic valve is interesting and must be working as my little one doesn't have a problem with gas when using this bottle.",1
"We recently switched my 7 month old daughter to a convertible seat.  She was just not looking comfortable in her infant seat any longer and we were totally over carrying around an 18lb baby in an infant seat.Rear facing for as long as possible is very important to us.  This seat rear faces up to 45lbs, which is the highest out there.  Most seats only go up to 40lbs.  Having room to grow and be comfortable in the seat was also a huge consideration.  All car seats are held to the same safety standards, so really what you're paying for is features and comfort.  We tried out our top 3 seats in a store before making our choice.  The Peg Perego seat was the clear winner.The other seats we were considering, for our '07 Honda CRV, were the Maxi-Cosi Pria 70 and the Britax Pavilion G3-70.  The Pria had a nice comfortable seat but the headwings were so large and closely spaced that we felt her head might outgrow the seat!  The Britax seat was a clear leader due to their safety reputation and our love for our infant seat (Britax B-Safe) but we ended up liking this seat LEAST of the 3.  The seat fit her well, perfectly really... at SEVEN MONTHS.  There is no way she would have been comfortable in this seat as she grows.  Her feet were already over the edge on the Britax seat.The Peg Perego seat has wonderful fabric.  I can tell it will keep her cool (it's winter so I can't truly gage this till summer).  The seat is spacious, she has plenty of room to grow into it.  She looked and seemed the most comfortable in the PP seat.  I love that she's up a bit higher so she can see out the window.  It's easy to load her in and out, much easier than the infant seat.  Installation with LATCH was a breeze.  I cannot recommend this seat enough!",1
"These are very cute and fit perfectly in an IKEA EXPEDIT.  However, they're basically the same materials as the comparable IKEA item, but they are even more flimsy because of the fold along the center of each side panel.  I expected better for the price and will be returning this.",0
"Fits great for the space we need.  It was not easy lokin g for one at local stores,  byt Amazon had it.",1
"Great design, very practicalThere were some issues with the item being slightly damaged but as I needed to be ready for when bub comes, i was offered and accepted a partial refund.",0
"I bought the Diaper Dekor when my son was born.  For the first few months, this was great.  But, recently, it's not so good.  The smell is not contained.  I find myself changing the bag a few times a week just to get the smell out of his room.  My friend has the Diaper Champ which definitely contains the smell.  Next time, I will buy that.",0
Awesome invention! Covers the front of the toilet nicely to minimize child's contact with the toilet. Generally stays in place but it's best to keep a hand on it while your child slides off.,1
Perfect  for my niece to carry her Barbie and her juice when from home to the car while visiting relatives.,1
"How can the simplest of potty seats be the most expensive?  In this case, you must pay for the simplicity and functionality of this design.  We looked at many other potty seats with music, lights, lids, and countless other useless bells and whistles.  You would have to clean those things at a car wash to get in all the crevices and moving parts.  This seat is stable, simple, and easy to clean - just like the one I had when I was 2.  I guess no one but Baby Bjorn thinks simple functionality is the way to go.",1
I've sent this as a gift to several friends and I think they've all been very happy with it.There's enough in the box to be festive and share with a sibling but it's appropriate price wise.,1
"Love this pillow - I don't know what I would do without it! I was having trouble staying asleep (and staying on my side) during the night after my 3rd month of pregnancy - this pillow helps so much, I wish I'd gotten it sooner.",1
Nothing particularly beyond the label.  If you need to leash your kid up - and sometimes we do - this does the trick in a way that our little one has fun with!,1
"We put these on all of the bottom kitchen and bathroom cabinets, as well as a few pieces of furniture in the living room.  No regrets.  Easy to install and not a hassle to use regularly.",1
Love this car seat! It feels so safe and secure. Was easy to install and feels very padded and soft for my son.,1
"I am writing my review after having had this stroller for a year.We looked at the UppaBaby, Phil and Ted's (too many bad reviews and tire troubles--I didn't want to get stuck downtown with a flat tire! I would take a bumpier ride to avoid that problem.), the Quinny (not an option for 2nd child), Bugaboo (too expensive), and the Bob (can't recall whey we didn't go with this one, maybe it was the 2nd child option too).I can't say enough good things about the UppaBaby, I use it every day and it works like a champ!  I think it will carry me through all the children I have with ease and retain enough value too for re-sale. It drives like a dream, and if you haven't test-driven strollers, that may seem like a silly comment but it is very important!  I have a jogging stroller, it drives like a tank, the uppa baby is like smooth german engineering, but made in the USA (I think)!I also have the snug fit insert, the rain cover and the baby ganoush (blanket thingy) and really like all of those accessories.  I will say, my son never used the bassinet, just never liked it, so the snug fit was a must for us and works perfectly for the first 4-5 months depending on the size of your baby---it is essential if your baby is not going to be in the car seat (we got the chicco adapter, works perfect), and will not ride in the bassinet.I put at least 2 miles per day on this stroller and it still looks brand new and handles perfect.  I use it mostly on sidewalks.  I did have a problem with the breaking mechanism, it would lock the right wheel but not the left, but contacted uppababy and within 30 seconds they were sending me a new frame!  Phenomenal customer service!!I did get a different cup holder since everyone said that the uppababy version wasn't good, and I don't know that there is any good cup holders for strollers.  I think the key is to use a spill resistant cut (one with a lid), I have an insulated cup for cold, and a thermal mug for coffee, and use the Sunshine kids universal holder and there is room for 2 cups (mine and the baby's) and keys, cell phone, etc in the center, I have no complaints about it.I have already purchased the rumble seat and have used it a few times with a friend's daughter, and she likes looking at the baby while she rides.  I think that some kids may not like that he/she can't face out, but for my circumstance, I actually think my son will be more interested in the ride on piece where he can stand at the back, so will probably order that when we have our next child.All in all, I can't say enough about how much I love this stroller, yes it is expensive, but it is worth it if you are going to use it every day.  If you only need something for mall trips, I'm not sure I would spend the money, you could probably get by with something else, albeit not as nice, but I walk my dogs twice a day and we live downtown, so we walk everywhere and having a good stroller was very important to us.I've been so pleased with the Vista, I'm going to order their Luxe umbrella stroller for mall trips and to have something easy to get in and out of the car.",1
Loved the idea of these darling salt and pepper shakers as a stocking stuffer. Unfortunately they arrived in a million pieces. A padded envelope is clearly not suitable packaging for such a fragile product.,0
The legs that attach to the base tend to come loose. We used it 2-3 times [less than 30 minutes each] before 2 of the 3 legs got disconnected from the base.This toy is hazardous and should be pulled off the market.Please do not buy this.,0
"I first bought an older version of this stroller at a yard sale a year ago. I absolutely loved the old version, however it was lost on a flight. I ordered this new version and its TERRIBLE. My 18 month old is too large for the stroller and I can not fasten any of the buckles, to strap her in. This stroller is advertised to fit up to a 3 year okd child. Definitely not! I am extremely dissapointed in chicco customer service. They will do nothing. No refund. Basically told me tough, this new model complys with new safety requirements, however I can not strap my small 18 month old in????? Total waste of $90. Chicco company has Pathetic customer service.",0
"I purchased two of these: one pink, one blue.  The man child, who is hard on everything and wants to know how things work, pulled the thing apart and shoved the broken pieces down the air vent of our forced air heating vents.  He also pulled the plug that inserts into the clock off the cord that was still plugged into the wall.  However, in me saying that I think this is a fine, well made product.  It has been great for our daughter.  She loves the pink and loves the pictures.It did not help my children stay in bed.  I don't know that anything could, but our daughter loves it and wants another one for Grandma's house.",0
My daughter says it's beautiful but easily snagged she said it does not match her cartoon dragon theme but the product is beautiful she is just not sure how to use it yet.,1
"Every time I receive a baby shower invitation, I order one of these.I think they are wonderful for the busy Mom & Dad to keep an eye on the new baby. Also, they are the perfect gift and usually it is not a duplicate gift. Every new baby should have one.",1
"Love the versatility of this item - battery operated, car adapter, outlet and manual. Very noisy but, I have not found a quieter pump. It's easy to use and the adjustable speeds and suction are great for sore nipples. Appreciate the carrying case and all the accessories that come with this purchase.",1
"I HAD THIS BOUNCY SEAT FOR MY LAST ONE AND WHEN WE MOVED I DIDNT TAKE IT, THEN I GOT PREGNANT AGAIN AND I WAS LOOKING FOR THIS SEAT FOREVER, FINALLY FOUND IT, SELLER WAS GREAT AND THIS IS THE MOST ENTERTAINING AND STABLE BOUNCY SEAT YOU CAN GO WITH WOULD BUY THIS THING FOR TEN TIMES THE PRICE",1
"The part I like, the bib is very convenient, easy to carry with, and is quite water proofed.The part I don't like, it uses a sticker to wrap the bib around my baby's neck and the sticker does not work quite well. My baby can easily tear it apart. So I have to tight it up behind his neck, which makes him very uncomfortable and keeps pulling it.Overall it serves well as a good disposable bib.",0
I bought this for my daughter. She is really enjoying it. It will take some time to fit this but it is worth the effort when you see your baby comfirtably njoying the swing. I have been using this for last three months. my baby is 11lbs now and still there is no problem with the power or anything. Let me see how long she can use this.,1
"I bought this for my niece, but my children also had one. This is easy for young babies to grasp and they light enough for older children to play catch with. The loops make it easy to attach to a stroller. It is pliable and feels rubbery, so when my kids were teething, they did try to chew on it. It is made from polyurethane (no BPA or PVC) and &#34;meets the SPSIA and European requirements for phthalates.&#34;Note: The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 bans excessive amounts of DEHP, DBP, BBP in toys and in childcare articles used for children under 3 for feeding, sleeping or teething. There is also an interim ban on DINP, DIDP, DnOP in products that could end up in the mouth. It's my understanding that the ban in Europe is similar, if not more stringent than the United States. But there are other phthalates out there that are not covered under the ban.With that said, it's a great company and the best clutch toy for babies that I've come across.",1
"My daughter was waking us up nonstop getting  her arms and legs caught in the slats of her crib. Seeing as she could pull herself up the regular Breathable Bumper could no longer be used, as she could use it as a step. This shield is great! Safely stops her arms and legs from going through and can not be used as a step!",1
My 4 and a half year old son loves it. It gives parent a maximum control when the kid is with you. Absolutely genius product! Highly recommended it for those you want to enjoy biking with their kids.,1
"I've got the bugaboo and have been frustrated that they don't make a convenient carry all/cup holder like my cheapie graco. I love this, it holds my phone, water, snacks, wallet, keys and more!!!",1
I was offered a promo code to get one of their slings for free.  All I had to pay for was the shipping.  I ended up paying an overinflated shipping fee of $11 for a cheap piece of fabric sewn together from one end to the other.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP fabric!  There is NO support for you nor the baby.  The size was also too small.  They refused to refund me for the shipping fee.  How dare they charge $40 for a cheap piece of fabric is beyond me.  DO NOT BUY!,0
"My grandson loves sitting in this.  He enjoys the toys and the tray is big enough for him to play with other toys as well. Nice little seat for him while he's at the age he can sit up but is unable to sustain himself for long or support himself to play.  Expect to get some further use as he gets older, for highchair purpose at my house when visits and starts eating.",1
This is really cute in the tub and works great with your standard tub faucet and makes my daughter smile.,1
"Attached very well and easy on my baby's stroller and he is very confortable and warm. When he was feeling too hot, I can adjust and open out the bundle as much I want. And it can be use until 3 or 4 years old.",1
"I bought this dish for my granddaughter who just began solids at 4 months.  I had a similiar feeding dish when my children were that age and how wonderful it was to feed them warm cereal, meats and vegetables.  So the concept of hot water within the dish to keep the food the perfect temperature is nice.  I looked everywhere for one and finally found it on AMAZON.  It is great.  Easy to use, easy to clean and very well made.  The bottom portion of the dish separates after use when you clean up so that you can get the hot water out easily.  I highly reccomend this product.",1
"These are very nice night lights.  They are made well, are attractive, and suit my purpose.  The dimming/brightness feature as the room gets darker or lighter is very practical and the amount of light the nightlight produces is perfect.  I have one on the landing on my stairs and it lights up the staircase without my having to turn on a larger light.  The two-count is attractive for the pricing.  I purchased these after finding some others at Lowe's that had poor reviews.  Happy with this purchase.",1
i bought these sippy cups for my son because he loves nemo. they are super cute and a little wide because they're insulated but are very durable.,1
"I hung these over the crib, the baby loves to look up at the seals. They look great. Nice addition to the nursery.",1
"My grandmother purchased this playpen about a year ago to keep at her house so that whenever myself or my sister came over with our kids, they would have a safe place to play. My son is now approaching 2yrs old and still loves to get in it and play with his toys. The large design means there is room in there for more than just him.(Toys too)-The other play-yards do not have much room in them at all. -He loves the all of toys attached to the sides. I love the fact that he can see out on all sides and I can see in. (He can also see to watch T.V. with his big sis while safely confined.)I like this playpen so much I have added it to my baby registry for our new baby. (Although, I have been begging her for a year, my grandmother won't give hers up!)I have another playpen made by Graco. One of the new fashion, smaller rectangular ones. It's been collecting dust in my garage since my son was 3 mo old.The only thing the rectangular play-yards are better for are trips,where you usually have a limited amount of space, and for the bassinet feature that this one does not have and most of the others do.(I've learned to just call hotels and make sure that they provide a crib.) This playpen does fold down to the same size as the others and it does include a traveling bag.A bassinet feature added to this playpen would make it perfect because it is a little deep to try and gently place a smaller infant down in. ( That is where a bassinet feature is really nice.) To tell you the truth though, they out grow that feature so fast that the benifits of this play-yard really out weigh that loss.It takes up a little more room than most of the other play-yards out there, but the room it gives your infant or toddler is well worth the loss of space.All in all it's larger old fashioned square design is the best! If I don't recieve one of these myself, as soon as the new baby arrives, I'm stealing grandma's!",1
"My husband and I LOVE these bottles.  My son has been using them since he was 1 week old.  I have not had any issue with the ""gasket"" melting in a the dishwasher (I even use our sanitation rinse option).  I take them apart, place the gasket and nipple in our dishwasher basket on the top rack and they are ready to go!I do let all pieces dry thoroughly and carefully place them together.  You have to line up the bottle with the bottom part with gasket just right, if not they will leak.  Each leak we had was ""user error"" not a defect of the bottle.  I highly recommend these BPA free bottles and will not use another brand!",1
The play pen is exactly what I neeeded.  Definitely happy with it and would recommend it to anyone and the price is right too!,1
"The highchair was easy to assemble.We really like this wooden highchair. We have a pub height table and the highchair is perfect for our little girl to sit at the table with us.There is a ""permenant"" front bar with small tray, so she can sit in it without the main & snack trays attached.  We've found it super easy to keep clean.We use the back shelf for a small bin of bibs, which is really useful.If we unscrew the ""permenant"" front bar/tray the chair pushes right up to the table and will be perfect height for her to eat at the table when she outgrows use of the trays. This is a really nice feature as this seat has the appropriate seat size and has wooden arm rests that will make it safer for her to sit with us at the table when she is a toddler/pre-schooler.We can see getting years of use out of this. It matches our dark wood set nicely.",1
Have had this bag for 10 years used it for 2 kids. Now I use it as a handbag. The center pocket is lined in a very strong plastic so I can carry bottles of water and snacks. It converts to a backpack. I love the length of the strap in can go across the body. Under the flap is one large out side pocket. Then inside the flap is 2 smaller pockets for you cell phone and keys. The bag has 3 compartments 2 that zipper and a pocket on the back that zippers. BEST BAG IN THE WORLD.,1
"This diaper pail system holds a lot of diapers, I've never had a problem with odor seeping out and the bags are economical and easy to change.  Way better than the diaper genie according to my friends who have that diaper pail system.",1
"I don't really write reviews online unless I feel really strongly about the product. So I really mean it when I say, this bedding set is fantastic! It's a bit pricey at $45, for a little toddler bed set. But I honestly think it's worth it. It was all SO SOFT, right out of the bag, before I even washed it for the first time. I got it for my son 3 months ago, and it hasn't faded at all (I wash it in cold water). The design and colors are true to picture. I definitely recommend this bedding!",1
"This is just ok. It's very convenient, but I've found its usual resting place is in my car, not in my purse. It's just too big for my purse.",1
Love these diapers. I'm new to cloth diapers but these have made it so easy! Easy to wash and fit great on my 4 month old 11 pound son,1
"My toddler is a tough one... She is such a picky eater that often she'll only eat baby food pouches - and only if allowed to eat while walking around (ridiculous). Anyway, that's fine, until she decides she is done with whatever pouch she has and tosses it across the room or squeezes it all over my carpet. *sigh* But these - these are genius! I have had them for about a week so far, and I have not had to spot clean my carpet once since! No more drips, no messes on my carpet! My carpet and my sanity are saved because of these things! And, the little attached cap part is great for on the go. Love them.",1
"We bought one of these from BB&B; about a year and a half ago when my now 2-year-old was about 7 months and too wiggly to be fed in her bouncy chair any longer.  We have plenty of room for a high chair, but they're just so unattractive and huge that I started looking for other options.  Debated between this and a booster-style chair that sits in your existing chairs and I must say for young kids, this is the way to go!  It sat attached to our island pretty much nonstop until recently when I've decided to move her to a regular chair...now it sits waiting for our 4-month-old to be big enough to use it.  After so much use, the pad is a bit worn but otherwise still looks great.My only complaints are:*It is a PAIN to keep clean - the handles can get filthy since they are right there next to the food, the front strap gets a lot of spills on it, and most of the seat is fabric so it takes a little more than a quick wipe down.  I've thrown the pad in the washer a number of times though, just the straps are pretty much impossible to get completely clean since they are attached to the frame.*It doesn't fit on my dining table with a 4"" skirt and a 3"" lip - I knew that was pretty likely though so I wasn't too disappointed, but it would have been nice to eat at our table rather than the island bar.  But I think it would attach to *most* tables.Now that my daughter is older, I'm worried she is going to dive out of it one of these days (have had a few close calls now that she can undo the straps) & being that it is so high off the ground where we have it, we've moved her to a a regular chair with a booster.  But for older babies/young toddlers, it is awesome & just as nice as the much more expensive ones.",1
"this thing is falling apart I've had it for over a year and the small pocket in the front, the zipper broke and the back one as well. It's made of a very bad quality material and the stiches are ripping off. Very disappointed, love the style of it but not the quality :(",0
"Its longer than my pac n play mattress by about 1.5 inches but tucks under and seems to stay in place flat under a sheet with elastic all the way around it.  I've only washed it once, so maybe it shrinks more.  Seems the best option for a pac n play protection that's organic.",1
"This bedding set is very pretty and comfortable. Unlike other sets containing wall decorater etc., everything in this set is useful. Love the valance a lot. Oh, there are two valances coming with it, which make the decoration of the room painless.",1
"I love him. well made, very soft fur ,cute with attitude, very similiar to doll in movie. Arrived sooner than advertised",1
I think this is going to be super fun for my younger son once he gets a little older. My older son (2) liked playing with it for a bit. My only concern is if mold might get in it because it's not that easy to empty completely. I'm hoping that won't be an issue. The little pieces inside it do get sticky and you sorta have to pick through the front to try to separate them.,1
"My son has loved this activity center since he was 3 months.  It always keeps him occupied in the car.  He falls asleep holding the pull handle, and loves all the fun noises it makes.  Highly recommend for all babies.",1
"I'm new to cloth diapering. These liners help with the poop mess. I wanted to try cloth diapering while making it as easy as possible. These fit the bill. My only complaint is that during the day when my LO is most active, whey seem to bunch up. It hasn't been a real problem yet as he doesn't usually poop then! I would recommend these especially if you don't have a sprayer and would rather skip the whole touching poop thing that comes with cloth diapering (even with gloves, I'm not a fan).",1
"I was not at all happy with this bag when it arrived. I did not like the material or the color. I thought it was supposed to be yellow and I don't know if anyone else felt this way but it looked green, not yellow. I don't think the outside pockets are easily accessible but I did like how many pockets it had and its overall size. Had it actually been a yellow bag and felt like it were made from better quality materials I probably would have kept this bag.",0
"i bought this for my grandaughter and my daughter loves it, she says it is her fav bib, i def will be buying another one.",1
"I was a little hesitant about purchasing this glider because 1.) the price point and 2.) non-favorable reviews.  We saw a display model setup at a brick and mortar store and decided to give it a shot.  I'm glad we did.  You would be hard pressed to find a nicer piece of furniture under $200.Assembly was rather painless as a lot of the pieces came preassembled and took under a half hour to complete.  Pretty much just put Screw-A into Hole-B.I was pleasantly surprised with the build quality of the glider.  My girlfriend uses the chair quite a bit with our 4 month old son while reading or rocking him to sleep.I'm 5'11"""" 225+ lbs and am comfortable sitting/gliding in the chair.  I would like to note that my girlfriend is about 5' tall and has a little trouble planting her feet on the floor when sitting back in the glider. If you're of shorter stature you may want to keep that in mind.I'm happy to report that we have had no issues with the glider after a little over 4 months of use.  Should anything change I will update my review.",1
"My baby used this from time to time from 3 weeks to 8 weeks. It would calm her instantly, but when she would wake up she would scream because she didn't like being swaddled to begin with. She was able to move her hands around and even got them out a bit so she could suck on them. We stopped using it at 8 weeks because she needed her hands to self-soothe. I think it's a great swaddle, especially because she hated the miracle blanket, which my 1st daughter loved.",1
"These items were so beautiful! The delivery was super fast! I got it a week early! It took me a while to find a baby bedding I liked and as soon as I saw this one, I fell in love with it. I didn't like anything else I saw, because I'm a savvy shopper and continued to look around, this one was by far my favorite! The only thing is I need to find a lamp to go with the shade, and a changing table sheet to match. =] Thank you so much.",1
"These wash up very nicely and are exceptionally thick as opposed to the other washcloths that are super thin, curled edges after washing...these have kept their shape and are multi-use!",1
Most storage bins are fairly large to store many items. I bought these because they matched the Tend Lab bedding set I bought. But these are shockingly small. Cant fit much and look awkward on the shelf. Make sure to check the dimensions before purchasing.,0
These are just as pictured and so cute in my daughter's butterfly room.  A great buy. I would buy again.,1
"First and foremost I love that these are BPA free. That is very important to us in this house with all our plastic products. This is a decent sized bottle. Not to small, but not a waste of space and to large. We are definitely loving the angled bottles vs the straight bottles. No leaks at all!",1
"I love this sheet set. Super cool for a boy in the not quite tween/teen stage. I am not a fan of &#34;character sheets&#34; so this was perfect. The colors are so great, so easy to put a room together around this set.",1
"It leaves a film on your window after the first use.  It also fell off a couple of times while using it...does not stick well, at least initially.  Haven't used it but once.",0
"I would do a commercial for this thing if they let me!  It is fantastic and it doesn't take up as much room in the bed as you would think. Before I got the Snoogle, I was about 5 months pregnant and suffering from fairly significant hip aches during the night.  My back began to ache as well, and that's when I decided I needed to do something about it.  Since I've been using the Snoogle my hip and back pain have been alleviated. I'm sleeping MUCH better (except for the whole bathroom issue at 7 months...) which makes for a much better day.  Get this pillow - you won't regret it.",1
Kind of large for little hands.  And as my little one grew he wasn't into rattles anymore.  Good concept. Just needs to be smaller.,0
"I researched what I wanted in the way of a fun playpen for when my grandchildren visit. This is the one I chose, easy up and easy down and easy to put away, plus being fun for them is an added bonus. Thanks!",1
my som loves it and it really works. now i don't worry about my son's dirty clothes.i think it is a good product for most of mothers,1
The car seat adapter is great with our Phil and Ted E3 stroller.  Our two year old toddler loves sitting  in the doubles seat below in the back.,1
But my husband wanted it on the registry.  And we both love it.  It is very convenient.  Contains smells unlike a regular garbage could.,1
"This is a great seat and a lifesaver when we go out to eat.  The tray is essential for a toddler who eats with his hands.  It also keeps him from grabbing silverware, glasses, tableclothes, etc. and keeps him happy for about an hour.  Some problems with this seat: heavy to travel with, straps are not easy to put away when the seat is folded, hard to carry with the tray.  I still love this seat even with these problems and I haven't found a better one that comes with a tray.",1
"They're quite smaller than what I thought and the handles were scratched, and came in only one color even though the picture shows 3 different colors.  I'm 'ok' with them..they're stocking stuffers... just wish the quality was much better.",0
Bought this for my 88yo Mom.  keeps the hand held shower sprayer closer to her and is easy to suction to shower enclosure.,1
My twins are learning their colors and really enjoy the bright colors in these lights.  They take the lights with them on trips and take turns calling out the colors as the lights change.,1
"I purchased this monitor for our daughter.  She and her husband use it on a daily basis and absolutely love it.  They have a stationary video monitor, but there is alot of feedback and the image is not clear.  They both said it is much more quiet and the image is crystal clear on the Summer portable one.I would highly recommend this product based on my their satisfaction with it.",1
These are great.  Much more durable than a plastic baggie/ziploc.  The zipper closure is easier for little hands to close than a plastic baggie.  Easy to wash and holds a good hand full of animal crackers.,1
"My 1.5 yr old son loves this cup.  For whatever reason, he sees it an always wants to drink from it.  But it takes him about 3x as much time and effort to get anything out of it so he eventually just gets sick of it and quits.  It's too leakproof for its own good",0
"Love this bib. It is so easy to clean and it catches mostly everything that my little on drops. After she eats I just wipe it down in the sink and set it to the side to dry, then it is ready for the next meal! My daughter is a year and I just barely discovered these. I was using the small little material ones up till now. I had to wash them so often.",1
This is such a cute set.  Everything is nice and soft.  It looks just like the picture.  They must be comfy because my almost 2 year old loves them and has never had an issue with them.,1
I searched before my son was born for the perfect sunscreen for our car. We have a Optima and these fit the back windows perfectly. They are easy to install and remove if needed. The part I like the best is you can see through them easily. Many were rated negatively because of that but these are great.,1
"I tried this pillow during my pregnancy at various stages and it did nothing for me. It is gigantic and hard to move around. It is overstuffed and uncomfortable. All of the curves hit me at the wrong places, maybe I am too tall for this pillow at 5'9"". It is expensive and costs a lot to ship back, so make sure you really, really want this big uncomfortable pillow before you buy it.",0
This is the only sippy cup my daughter would drink from.  I love it accept the spout breaks and leaks after a couple of uses.  My baby chewed it only a few times and the spout was ruined.  The spouts are too easy to break.  Buy a few extra spouts when you get this cup.,0
"My daughter is 6 months old and she loves this rattle.  She likes to chew on it at different angles, and she seems to like that there are two rattle sounds: the clacking of the rings on the handle, and the pouring rattle sound of the beads in the bubble.  This is one of her favorite toys right now.",1
"It actually works well! It catches a lot of dropped food and spilled milk! Toddler will pick up food from it and eat it. He hated bibs before this one, he likes to chew the end of it. It is stiff so it doesn't look comfortable in tighter situations but it didn't seem to bother him.Now, months later, he likes to pop it off at the table when he's done. Sometimes, I will put a cloth and bigger bib underneath this one ie for yogurt and messy things, and he'll pop that one off now too. I'm still hanging on to it.",1
"Ugh, I really do love these scissors but they are sooo expensive. I would buy multiple pairs if they did not cost so much. These have been very handy and stay in my diaper bag all the time. I have a 19 month old and have been using these for the past 7 months. They are sharp, don't scratch up her plastic bowls, clean easily, have a helpful weight, and I never have to worry about rust. It's been key to helping my picky toddler eat adult foods; making cutting up meats, a bowl of noodles, all kinds of foods a breeze. I may try some small stainless steel ones to see how they work. (I have also used kitchen shears for the same purpose but due to their size, it's more work because cutting up food into tiny bits still requires larger movements.)",1
"Love, love, love!  Easy to put together, easy to clean, easy, easy, easy, and safe.  exactly what you would expect from a car seat.",1
"After buying such an expensive high chair, I am shocked that this baby seat is so poorly designed.  My son is 5 months old and 17 pounds and 26 inches tall.  Getting him in and out of this seat is nearly impossible.  At first we thought we had it set up wrong, but after re-reading all the instructions and fiddling with it, we realized that the problem was with the design of the seat.  It is way too narrow and tight to get a baby in and out of . . . especially a chunky one!  What a disappointment!  We haven't even begun solid foods and we cannot even use this seat.  Not to mention the design of this seat is dangerous.  If your child is choking, you need to be able to remove him or her from the seat quickly.  Getting a baby in and out of this seat cannot be done quickly without hurting him or her!!",0
"We have owned 8 convertible car seats in a short span of 3 years for one child, and my opinion is based on actual user experiences.  We tried 2 of the top rated seats by Consumer Reports, 3 Britax Advocates (CS and 70 CS), and 3 Sunshine Kids Raidan XTSL's).  I decided regardless of some issues with this car seat, it is still the best available.Pros: It is well built with thick plastic and steel re-inforcement; the fact that it is heavy is therefore a positive.  The rear facing weight limit of 45lbs is the highest for this class of car seat.  It is relatively well padded.  It is not as well padded as a Britax, however.  The headrest side impact wings are strong and re-inforced with Al bars.  Its stiff nature limits side way head movements, which I hope is a positive rather than a negative.  However, I wonder if there is a downside that it may not absorb energy well.  It seats low on the vehicle seat, reducing the center of gravity.  The super latch has the highest weight limit.Cons: The stiff headrest side wings could be a negative as mentioned above.  I am not sure if containing head movement or absorbing impact energy is more important.  The narrow width of the seat is a negative to me, as the car seat doesn't offer a wide zone of protection from side impactions on the chest, body, and leg areas.  However, this is a design decision claimed by the manufacturer to allow 3 of these seats installed side by side.  The installation was not secure unless both latch and seat belts are used.  The belt adjustment strap is difficult to adjust, especially if it is compressed between the car seat and the vehicle seat, as the strap is passed from the back to the front of the car seat directly under the car seat without a protecting space or channel.  I talked to tech support, and apparently this is a result of designing the car seat to seat low.  The headrest adjustment could be difficult to reconcile with the one particular height of the shoulder strap slots; the headrest could be too high to protect the head in one particular slot height for the straps.  There is no angle adjustment for rear facing.",1
no fly on the WIFI... unless you know networking and can change your ip and mac address.. if you don't then no internet for you!!! while monitoring a sleeping baby.. facepalm... no bueno.,0
Remember to wait thirty seconds before taking another temperature reading. It does matter!!! I hav the ear thermometer and this one and the temporal is more accurate,1
"I get a ton of compliments on this. I bought this one as a gift for someone else, but received a similar looking one (same maker) and it is perfect to attach to my daughters carrier/car seat. From 0-5 months, it provided me easy access to find the pacifier in a hurry, even while driving when I had to reach back and do it blindly. Now after 5 months, she picks it up herself and plays with it & looks at the colors. I can easily detach it from the carrier & re-attach it to her clothes when I take her out of the car. This way she has it with her if she wants it, and it's never falling on the floor. I love it!",1
"All of the pieces are constantly in my son's mouth, so I agree with the other reviewer that the stickers/glue on the shapes are problematic.  Upon opening, we soaked off the stickers so that we didn't have to worry about it.  I should first say that my son (14mo) loves this toy.  He likes to put the pieces in the bus, open the top, and drive it around.  For that, I'm glad we have it.  However, it's a terrible shape sorter.  You can fit the star through the square, the octagon through the circle, etc.  So....it doesn't teach shapes.  It teaches ""push any piece hard enough and it will go through most holes.""  But, like I said, he does love it.  I just don't understand why a shape sorter wouldn't be designed better for that purpose.",0
"I have two of these & like them ok.  I use Playtex Drop In bottles, which are a bit on the bulkier side.  These totes are generally well constructed & cute, but it is a tight fit.  With three bottles in them, I have a hard time closing the flap on the top.  As it is, with the velcro stuck, there are gaping holes in the top so they're definitely not sealing in the cold.  Also, the ice packs that come with them are very small in surface area so I wouldn't plan on taking bottles anywhere far with these.  Overall, I'd say they're all right.  A box shape (instead of a triangle) would have been better.",0
"After all my online searching at dozens of cribs, preferring white, I found this one to be a fabulous price and a very pretty design.  This one is for my grandson--due in 6 weeks.  So we put it together in no time and I love it!",1
We love these spoons. My 9 month old loved them from the first moment she used them. She also loves to play with them,1
"I recently bought this product in order to avoid supplementing breast milk while working. In my situation I often go to work for several hours pump and my husband will come take milk to the baby. After using the product on my thirty minute lunch break, in the break room, in plain sight while eating lunch. (if thats not enough) I realized I would not have time to do both separately. the Freemie has effectively taken away my choice of feeding myself lunch, feeding my baby, or just plain not working and allowed me the freedom of doing all three... Thank you Freemie",1
I love this stroller!  It is so nice to have a quick and practical way to transport the baby in the car seat.  I use this stroller almost every day and I wish we would have had it for all of our babies!,1
"Our 8 month-old loves this toy.  3 different settings, soft to the touch and easy to use.  Catchy enough music doesn't drive us crazy.  Highly recommended.",1
I actually when to buy baby bottles and then ordered zippy spouts to replace convert bottles into zippy cups. Love the product but the zippy are so expensive,1
"You can get this exact set at BJ's for $10.99. If you have a membership I'd highly recommend it! Otherwise it's a good set, just don't count on the bowls unwaveringly sticking to the tray or table... they are pretty easy to pull off. For a toddler working on using utensils they are great since they won't slide around.",0
These were a gift for some friends who had just renovated and Airstream trailer. They loved them and they have held up well in the outside elements.,1
"Very cute, my daughter loves it. I wish they had adjusted the design so the bars don't fall out so easily though.",1
"The quality of the product is very nice, but it did not serve our purpose.  We bought a new covertible bed that we plan for our son to use for many years and I hoped this would keep him chewing his bed.  I purchased covers for the front, back, and sides.  I tried to secure these several different ways, but it was just too easy for him to push them to the side and get to the bed rails.  He could not get to the center of the rails, but the ends are literally chewed to pieces.",0
this is a good bottle i love to have it...it is easy to clean up and it it look nice,1
"My son is not quite 2 months old but so far I love this!  The stroller is so smooth and light and easy to handle.  The basket IS on the small side, but I just use a mommy hook and that does most of the carrying of things that I need.  The car seat is a little heavy, but not terrible.  That is the only thing I would improve on this system.  My son does get sweaty in the car seat when he gets all worked up and crying when he doesn't want to be in it, but just calm he is fine and not hot and sweaty.  I love the big canopy of the stroller and the carseat, together they can completely shade/cover the baby.  Overall I would recommend it!",1
The car seat is great.  But it gets pretty hot even with the air condicioner. I do not recommend This one.,0
Bought this product to corral the bathtub toys and I love the fact that it has a wide mouth and sits right into the holder attached to the tub wall. Its perfect for my tub!,1
"Hi to every busy Mom, easy cleanup! I have 4 kids under the age of 3 (a girl, 30 months, and triplets 15 month) I throw the place mats with the bibs in the washing machine on the gentle/handwash cycle and it is cleaned up. The ""food catcher"" avoids to big of a mess on the floor. The only drawback tomato sauce will stain the material.",1
"I ordered these as well and I do love the blankets. They are the BEST swaddling blankets around. However, I was also disappointed that although they shipped quickly and I did receive them in the proper time frame. I didn't get the 2 blankets pictured. I ordered the Liam the brave set because I really wanted to light blue blanket. However, I received the circular patterned one pictured and a white one with dogs on it. I wish the seller had specified that you may not get both of the blankets shown. If I had known that was the case I would have ordered 2 plain blue Aden and Anis swaddling blanket from another seller. Over all they are a great product.",1
"We bought this thermometer for our kids -- a 2-1/2-year-old and twins on the way. We've tested it out on our toddler and it provides consistent readings, and is very easy to use -- so easy that she can do it on herself and get good temperature readings! We formerly had an ear thermometer, which had a few problems for us. The readings on the ear thermometer were not very consistent (if you don't point it directly at the eardrum, it will record an artificially low temperature) and, while it was fine to use on our daughter when she was younger, recently she has resisted using the ear thermometer -- which makes it hard to point correctly and therefore basically useless for recording her temperature. The temporal artery thermometer is so easy to use -- just hold a button as you move the thermometer across the forehead -- and provides accurate readings every time. A must-have for families with kids.",1
"This product came smashed, poorly wrapped and it didn't work. At All. My hubby just opened it up and got the lights to work but it absolutely can not rotate without a motor. So if you are looking for a bad nightlight that doesn't work here's your sign.",0
Holds wet/dirty diapers until laundry-day. Does get a bit damp if the diapers are wet from toilet-rinsing but I've got no complaints. I wash it with the diapers and dry it in the dryer (not sure if that's recommended).,1
"I bought this tub for my daughter's twins.  She loves the tub and the way the children sit in it.  However, her twins are still very small, 5 to 6 pounds and she says it is a little big for them.  It would probably work  better for babies weighing 8 pounds and over.  Other than that she says she plans to get lots of use out of this tub!  Very sturdy!",1
"It's misleading to label this product ""green"" or ""eco-friendly,"" as it contains vinyl, which is decidedly unfriendly, both to the environment and to people. I don't think one needs to buy a ""non-toxic"" changing pad, as babies are only on them for minutes at a time, and never face down, but it's unconscionable to call this eco-friendly when it isn't.",0
"I love this blanket because of how bright it is.  Get the hamper from this line, too.  They look get together.",1
"DON'T BE FOOLED BY ALL THE FIVE STAR REVIEWS- THEY'RE REAL- BECAUSE THIS MIRROR IS AWESOME! I've been looking for a mirror for 6 years now. THEY ALL STINK. This one is so fabulous. It doesn't jiggle or wiggle at all. And I drive bumpy roads all the time. I can see my son and all of the rear windows in my minivan AT THE SAME TIME. It's actually made my car safer by expanding my vision in the back of my minivan. It is so easy to install you could do it if you had hooves instead of hands. I'm going to buy a few more to keep forever. I'm in love!!!!!!And seriously, I am a real reviewer, see how many reviews I do... you won't be sorry if you buy this mirror. Search ended.",1
"This tubing fits my pump perfectly! It may be a little stiffer than the original tubing, but I haven't had any issues with it.",1
"I bought this stroller cause I needed something quick and inexpensive. Its easy to fold down, and I like the color and holds alot underneith but the front wheels wobble alot on the first site of uneven pavement and doesnt recline much.",0
"This is a terrific idea and was great for a couple of months. But like many of the reviewers have said, the suction cups stopped sticking within months. And nothing seems to fix the problem. Went in the trash.",0
"This a great monitor, I have been using it for close to 4 years now and I am getting ready to purchase a 2nd set for our new baby.  I leave one plugged in next to bed at all times and have never had a problem (it still works on battery power as well).  The range is quite long, you can go pretty far outside and it still works great, the only noise we get from them is from the white noise machine or humidifier we keep in her bedroom.  I was happy to see I could still purchase this for this time around since our kids sleep upstairs and we sleep down we need to have a monitor longer.",1
"This organizer is perfect for my toddler to keep his books, toys, and drinks.  It also helps to protect the back of my seat from his shoes.",1
"I really like the closing/locking mechanism on this gate- with a couple tries you can learn to open them one-handed, but they're tough enough to deter the little ones. I love that it's walk-through and that the gate only opens one way (no swinging or banging back and forth). However - two problems I've run into:1. These are adjustable, to an extent. They come with an add-on side extender- but there's one particular doorway width where the extender is just a bit too wide, so you end up with the adjuster bolts screwed WAY out. With the bolts so far out, the gate is a bit unstable. This will present us with a problem pretty soon.2. Again with a certain doorway width, floor trim might present a problem. One of our gates is set up with the side extender, but we have floor trim that makes the doorway too narrow for the side extender. We ended up having the bottom bar of the gate a couple inches off the floor and just had to learn to step over it.Not ideal, but once we learned how to walk around them it was okay.",0
"I have back problems. When my son was born, a good friend (who also has back problems) loaned me her Ergo carrier proclaiming it's the best one by far for her back. Amazingly, I am able to lug my 25 pound son around in this thing for over an hour at a time with no back pain. (I can't speak for 2 hrs or longer- I haven't dared try carrying him that long.) I LOVE it.Alas now my friend is expecting another child, so her beautiful Ergo goes back to her and I of course decided to order my own on Amazon. Because of warnings about fake Ergo's being sold here, I made sure to select the more expensive option- one that included free shipping and was sold directly by Amazon- and I crossed my fingers. It arrived today, and I was immediately disappointed to realize that it is a fake.If I hadn't used the other (legitimate) one for so long, maybe I wouldn't have thought twice. BUT the fabric on this fake one is much lower quality and it feels less substantial. I confirmed through Ergo that it's fake (the warning label is only in one language, the buckle is by the wrong brand, and there is no serial number). I am sending it back and buying one directly from Ergobaby. I refuse to take a chance on my back.The REAL Ergo I rate 5 Stars. THIS Ergo I rate 1 Star... Thus the 3 Star review.",0
"I really like this carseat - like many other have said - great quality, protection, padding, and ease of use.  I do think the CS option is somewhat unnecessary.  We don't find it terribly useful to hear the ""click"".  I think you can just as easily figure out how tight the straps should be, without the feature.  In fact, we don't often loosen the straps after tightening them, since our baby seems to get in and out easily enough with needing to do loosen/re-tighten the straps.  I'd just save the money and get the regular Boulevard without the CS feature, if I had to do it all over again.  (Unless the car seat is on sale and the price difference between the two models is very small.)Overall, we really like the car seat, and our son seems very happy in it!",1
I loved these brushes. They can pass through any narrow opening to clean properly.When I had my son I wanted to make sure the bottles were cleaned throughly. Extra cleanso buying these brushes helped me clean my Dr Brown bottles i was using.,1
"I got this as a shower gift and thought it was an excellent gift.  I changed my mind very quickly.  My son is only 3 1/2 months old and it is already smelling up my son's room.  The little deodarizer thing doesn't do anything!  Also the first time I changed the bag, the springs broke under the top.  I still use it because it's the only thing I have, but I would not reccommend this to anyone.  One day, I'll spend the money and get a better one.",0
"This blanket really lives up to its name!  It is incredibly soft and plush - perfect for wrapping up tender newborns or as a ""security blanket"" for older ones.  Folded in half, the size is just right for tucking around a baby in a car seat or bouncy seat.  Opened up, it makes a great wrap-around blanket.  We couldn't be happier with this blanket!",1
"So these have TABS that are more bulky/larger like a HH(HappyHeinys) & unlike the BG(BumGenius).  The dipe itself isn't much bulkier though!  IMHO, these are more convenient than a BG though, cause you don't have to stuff it--and UN-stuff it before washing it--yuck!! This being an ALL-IN-ONE diaper...there's no stuffing, no snapping, no unstuffing, and you don't even have to match up the different brands of inserts you might have with their diapers, because it's sewn-in for you!  I LOVE the snapped in doubler for boys!!  And I don't even NEED to unsnap it to wash. So it's truly a one-step diaper like a sposie, which is the whole point of using an all-in-one!Note: Nighttime I still use MT Pockets since I can really stuff it good!  But these are a large part of my stash!!  Love 'em!  Highly recommend them to anyone!Only drawback is the price...or I would own all these for daytime use!",1
This decal was incredibly easy to apply and has stayed put even after some repositioning.  The colors are as shown.,1
"great item, keeps a tall active sleeper warm and asleep at nightwarmer than the fleece sleep sacks we had, and soft and breatheable",1
3 blankets have animations but one doesn't-just plain white. Very soft and breathable! Larger size than most swaddle blankets! I recommend them!,1
"Very pretty design. It is more of a blue aqua than a green aqua. I think the painted walls in the picture is a bit deceiving, color wise. But I still love it!",1
Nice to call and good bag liked it.,1
"If I would have reviewed this a month ago, I would have given it 5 stars, but now that I know what can happen to a baby by using this product as a sleeper, like it is advertised, I am very disappointed and upset with Fisher-Price! This product has caused torticollis, a condition of the neck muscles caused by being in one position for too long, and plagiocephaly, meaning miss-shaped head, in both of my twins. They slept in these from the day they came in from the hospital until yesterday, when I began researching it and discovered that I am not the only parent who has experienced this. My girls were diagnosed with these conditions, one at 2 months of age, and her sister about 3 weeks ago. I strongly believe that twin B would have never had these problems had it not been for this product. I believe baby A may have, due to her position in the womb, but this product only made it worse. Now we are looking at at least 6 months of physical therapy and at least one baby who will need a very expensive corrective helmet, worn 23 hours out of each day, to fix what these caused! As great as they are for babies to sleep in, it isn't worth it!!!",0
"I had the smaller ones, and as my child grew a little bigger, this became essential. It washes soft and is super useful without irritating my baby's sensitive skin. Would buy again in a heartbeat.",1
I was disappointed to notice the spinning part of the rattle was already broken on arrival. I returned it and ordered another one. Hopefully the second one will be fine.,0
These are cute and practical. They are good quality and wash well. I have them on my son's stroller straps so they don't dig into his neck. They do a good job of providing cushioning without being super bulky and annoying to baby. I'm glad I bought them.,1
"I really really wanted to like this car seat.  I have had it for almost 3 months and just returned it today.  The pros:  I loved the look of the seat and the padding has a material that (for the most part) liquid beads up on it. It was very easy to install, and in fact I had to do it myself because my husband is so used to pulling as hard as he can with our Diono Radian that he pulled this one too tight and couldn't get it level (due to too much force).  It fit just fine in my Kia Sorento with room for a passenger and a Diono Radian all in the backseat.The cons:  First, let me say my baby is 5% height and weight, only 17lbs at 10 months old.  We put him in this at 7 months but he screamed so much we took it out and put him back in the infant bucket seat assuming he just wasn't ready for this yet.  Well, our bucket seat is a hand-me-down and it expired last month so we had to switch.  Every single time he was in the Chicco Nextfit he screamed bloody murder.  The straps dug into his poor little neck leaving  red marks.  I ended up cutting the shoulder pads off thinking it was them causing the marks (you are not advised to do that), but the marks are even worse with the pads off.  When the pads were on, they were so long that I couldn't get the straps tight enough for my liking.  It's a very deep seat which is good for extended rear facing (our 4 year old - also very small - is still rear facing in his seat) but bad when a little baby wants to see what his older brother is doing.  He couldn't see anything, although I think he was screaming more from the pain of the straps than not being able to see.  If the straps were moved farther apart I probably would have kept the seat, but I returned it and got a second Diono Radian.",0
"It's a very sturdy switch plate and installs easily.  It's measurements are slightly larger than the typical plastic switch plate but it's a non-issue.  Also, it matches our kid's jungle theme room decor perfectly.",1
"This is the BEST product you can buy for your baby.  We used it at least once a day to grind up whatever we were eating - a super easy (just as easy as popping open a baby food jar), cheap and nutritious way to feed your baby good quality food that hasn't been pureed, water-down, and cooked to it's nutritional death!  It perfectly grinds up anything you can put in it - meat, cooked veggies, fruit, pasta, rice - you name it!  Your child will get used to normal food textures, flavors and the transition into non-baby food will be much easier.  It is incredibly easy to use and clean, and makes feeding your baby fresh, quality foods very inexpensive.  I cannot recommend this product higher!",1
Great nail clipper but I found the magnifier to be more nuisance than help.  The baby's fingers are moving all the time and will never be precisely under the lens.  I always flipped it back and out of the way. But the quality and style of clipper works well.,1
saved a good bit compared to BRU price for their starter set; i believe it contained 1 less bottle but almost half the price.,1
"So happy i was able to find someone that sold the accrual Medela brand.  Just the right size and exactly what I expected, quick shipping.  Would seller use for future purchases.",1
"We bought 3 sets... family is buying them also.  Great idea for when you have to keep the little ones in a safe space, our twins love being and playing in it",1
a must have for little babies!!  the underneath of his  lily pad is black and white spots which my little guy loves looking at!,1
Sturdy. Have used it daily for 8 months and it's holding up great. No chemical smells at all. I didn't use the wheels and think the look is more classic this way. The ebony color is perfect. My son has always been large and this crib supports him well.,1
Great for tub or in pool.  Not flat like other brands and I have noticed they do not stick as easily on the tub wall.  Have had them for over a year and they stay clear of mold.,1
"My baby is 8-9 months old and instantly loved this toy. I keep the legs off for now because she is just crawling and learning to pull up, but they snap on and off super easily compared to other toys we have had to assemble. Even though the legs detach easily, they are still sturdy to hold up against the weight of a baby when they lean on it. There aren't grippers or rubber on the bottom of the feet, however, which in my opinion is needed when you have wood floors like we do (maybe the manufacturer would consider adding them to future models) to help prevent skidding. I will probably glue some rubber stoppers to the bottoms eventually or keep this on her play mat that is slightly rubberized. It plays TONS of songs with languages in English, French and Spanish. I saw previous reviews that babies were getting their fingers stuck in the flipper but it seems the manufacturer has corrected the spacing issue because I inspected this thoroughly before letting baby play with it and I do not see any spaces large enough for baby to stick her fingers in ( and she flips the flipper back and forth constantly). There are two levels to adjust for loudness. I would recommend this to friends, family, or a stranger I saw looking at it in the store without hesitation. Just be forewarned: Your house will never be quiet again once you start buying electronic toys for the kiddies! LOL. They do love this toy though so it is worth it to watch them learn and explore.",1
I am impressed by the quality of the materials and connectors. I am pleased with the purchase and would buy it again.,1
"The gate really does look nice.  That's about it, though.  The quality is very poor and the hinges are made of very cheap and flimsy black plastic.  Because of this, it's easy to open the gate and not realize the bottom portion is still ""locked in"".  This is because the plastic hinges are so flimsy that the gate door can kind of ""twist"" so that the top portion moves outward a good distance while the bottom portion is still closed.  Also, the description isn't very clear (nor are the details on the box) about the extensions.  The gate's advertised maximum width of 40.5"" includes the extensions.If you want a similar design with a far better build quality, get the First Years Hands Free Gate instead.",0
"Purchased as an """"add-on"""" item for a shower gift. Parents are using on the baby's carrier and these toys are always a hit in a whiny situation and to keep a little one occupied.",1
"This monitor is terrific!  It's simple but it does the job. I've had this monitor for 4 years and it's worked without fail.  I'm getting ready to buy another one for my second child, as the first 2 (not Graco monitors) have broken in less than 1 year.  I highly recommend this monitor.",1
Bought these for a cousin who was expecting. When they arrived I was pleasantly surprised. They are so cute and of good quality. I would recommend them to all.,1
Everything I expected I loved this product just as much as I loved the movie The Lion King when I was a kid.,1
"Our daughter had them for our grand daughter, and now will have them for our grandson. Great design, Great Product.",1
"These are the fifth clippers we've purchased. I love that these are sharp and don't take multiple attempts to get them to actually clip the nail, like our old ones did. They are a little awkward to handle b/c of their size, but I'm used to them now.",1
My daughter and my son both use these bibs.  They are big enough to catch all the mess.  They wash very easily under the kitchen faucet and dry fast for the next meal.  Great to have for the messy toddlers.,1
Gave this as a gift with shoes to fill the tree! She loved it!! She's very big into shoes and fashion so it was very fitting. Lots of compliments since she got it!,1
This is the 4th excersaucer I have owned. My teenager had one of the first ones 16 yrs agao and that one was fantastic! My 3 yr old had one given to her and one purchased for her. The purchased Tea Time fell short because of the recall.She'd already smashed her fingers before they did the recall and offered replacements.My 4 month old just received the Splash Mega saucer. The seat is very stiff and takes quite a bit of effort just for me to move it. I also noticed there are no kickstands as I call them.Why? Why is this now considered a replacement part that has to be purchased! I went to register my saucer and found the legs for .75 per. I must say I'm quite angry that these were not standard like they have always been. Now I'll have to order them and pay s&h. The fact that the saucer is set up to use them makes me even more angry that i have to pay extra for them.I've loved these saucers since the begining and I hate to see EvenFlo falling so short.Thankfully this will be the last I purchase.,0
"Ok, I bf my daughter for a year and my son is now 8 months and I am still bfing. My pump in style advance finally died the other day, i used I a ton because I make so much milk I always pump extra for my freezer stash. The PIS Advance is AWESOME! I am only bfing for a couple more months so I didn't want to spend $350 again when this is my last kid. But I am seriously considering selling this one and buying a used one because it sucks. Or rather, it doesn't.The highest setting is so slow and it only does one side so it takes forever to finish if you are pumping both sides. It sounds like a cow mooing and won't work with the ac car adapeter from the PiS because the Voltage is HALF. So annoying, I guess most of the people who reviewed this so positively don't know what they're missing. It's nice that it is so small and compact, but that's the only good thing. The motor in the PIS is by itself anyway (metro bag version) so it is very portable.Long story short, if you're going to be pumping a lot, spend the money on the advance! Not this one!",0
This is cute but it is activated by shaking the rattle that comes with it. You have to shake it very hard to get it to move. Sometimes I could not even get it to move myself let alone a baby being able to do this. The concept is cute and the music is nice but I was disappointed by the effort required to get this to move. Its now in the toy box and has not been bothered with for quite sometime.,0
"This is a great video monitor, a mush have. Great sound and video. Gives you peace of mind to move about while baby sleeps. Easy to use.",1
"Love this diaper bag and all its features . It has strap options , many pockets , and cute style . The only thing I notices is there's a couple places where the thread is coming apart a little and its only 1 month old .",1
"I ordered this blanket because my son received the same blanket a year ago when he was born and it has become his ""blankie"" So, I thought I should get another blanket incase something  happened to the original.Unfortunately, the new blanket is a lot different from the original and my son wants nothing to do with the new blanket. I've tried washing it multiple times;  i've even left it in his crib, so it would start to smell like his stuff, but the truth is the new blanket is no where as soft and i could tell the difference as soon as I opened the package.  The new blanket actually has a completely different texture from the original. The fur is much shorter (almost shaved) compared to my son's blankie which has longer fur. I don't know if the manufacture changed how they made the blankets in the past year or what happened, but I feel that the new blanket is a lower quality than the original.",0
"This product took into consideration the few criticisms of the diaper genie 2 and improved on it.  It has a little pedal you step on to open the top lid, you put your diaper in and release.  Truly one handed operation, minimal smell because of the way the internal clasp seals the bag when you step on the pedal, and you never touch the inside bag.  Occasionally, if I don't step on the pedal all the way, I get a whif of the internal contents because the clasp doesn't seal all the way...but I figure thats my fault for not doing it correctly.  It now has a handle on the front so you can carry it with one hand, and emptying is similar to genie 2.  If your a fan of the diaper genie...you'll like this product.You do still have to buy their refills, and that is the one big drawback.  I've seen the price come down to equal that of genie 1 refills, so if your already paying for them, then its not a problem.  Our refills last 3 weeks with our toddler's diapers.",1
"As an exclusively pumping mom, my 2 month old spends a lot if time in this chair. The vibrations soothe her and she stares at the waterfall. The chair is sturdy and I can bounce it with my foot. We use a boppy head support with it bc I'm worried she'll get a flat spot.I think there are some kinks with this bouncer. I do hear a clicking every once and a while, and twice the activity bar seems to have shorted out. Both times that happened it worked fine the next day.UPDATE: The motor started clicking then the vibrations got lighter and lighter until they disappeared even with fresh batteries. I called Fisher Price about it on a Monday, and a new motor arrived on Thursday of the same week. The bouncer has a one year warranty, and it could not have been easier to get a new motor since I had already registered the product with them. I am changing my review to 5 stars bc the customer service was so great.",1
"We ordered this playard because of the good reviews we found all over the internet. However, here is our opinion:The Bad:- The bassinet mattress is made of two hard panels that have a big gap in between. Each panel is padded separately, so the gap is pretty noticeable, about an inch wide and runs from head to toes of baby. That is the biggest disadvantage we found;- Since the bassinet mattress is different from the big mattress of the playard, we were not able to find any foams or mattresses to put on top of the cheap two-panel mattress;- 4moms customer service said the mattress is designed that way, there are no sheets available yet to put on the bassinet as of now;- It is a very heavy product, and all the accessories do not fit in the bag. The bassinet and the changing pad have to be carried separately.The Good:- Easy to set up- Nice neutral and modern colors- Good quality materialsFor the price we paid for this playard, we were very disappointed.  The bad items outweight the good and nice look of this playard.  We want our baby to sleep comfortable and that was our priority.  Returning the product was very easy through amazon.",0
"Price was right compared to other suppliers.Goes well with baby's theme and father's likesYes, would recommend to buy",1
"My baby girl is 8 months this month &amp; I have enjoyed it since her first bath! Since Macy was learning to sit on her own the ring has been there to prevent her from falling forward accidentally or when she reaches forward &amp; has been a great idea. The only thing is I think it could use some foam padding around the ring, though that plastic isn't harmful just would be more comfy I think. I would recommend it! I have to my sister expecting in April! Great Gift Idea! Good luck Brandi!",1
I HAD GOTTEN THIS PLAYPEN FOR MY GRANDSON. HE JUST LOVES IT. SOMETHING DIFFERENT ON THIS ARE THE SIDE WALLS THAT HAVE ENTERTAINMENT FOR HIM TO ENJOY. WHO EVER DESIGNED THIS; THIS IS BETTER THAN THE OLD FASHIONED PLAYPEN. I HAVE A HAPPY GRANDSON.,1
"The lamp is just as pictured but the quality is not the best.  The shade is especially flimsy.  That being said, it is cute in the nursery.",1
"These are a brilliant concept but a poor execution. I bought these for my teething 5 month old, and threw in some banana pieces. Bad idea. These things are impossible to clean, food gets stuck everywhere. I tried cold mango too, same results- 3 times through the dishwasher, soaking and scrubbing cannot remove all the food bits. And I'm not super paranoid about germs, but that just seems unsanitary. Another brand recommended cleaning with warm water, vinegar, and alka seltzer, so I'll be trying that- but in the meantime, will NOT be putting fresh fruit in these.That being said, I do make and freeze my own baby food, and a cube of that is messy but provides neater cleanup of the product, so it's not a total loss.Will I buy these for my next baby? God no. Not untill the design is revamped and I don't have to spend hours picking little banana bits out of the seams.",0
"I really love this its versitile and had I breastfed I probably would have used it more. My boyfriend uses it more often than I do because it keeps his arm from going to sleep while holding the baby. Furthermore it makes a good sleeping pillow for adults, so technically it will never be grown out of. :)",1
This was a perfect tub to use to get him out of the baby tub but he wasnt quite ready for the big tub.  He loves sitting in it.  He does slide around some but not too much.,1
i ordered this for my soon to be 1yr old son to take on vacation. we have been using it now for about a month. he seems to enjoy driving his cars on it and playing on it. i like that it is soft in case of a crash. but at the same time it is still flimsy and is permanently creased in the middle. all in all its worth the money.,1
These are the only bottles our baby would take.  They are wonderful especially if you switch between the breast and bottle often.  Wouldn't use anything other than the Playtex Advanced for my child.,1
Excellent mattress! Fits in our standard crib and no problem with crib sheets fitting. Firm enough for safety yet seems comfortable.,1
"I ordered this product thinking it would keep my 1 year old from falling out of bed while we were on vacation. He & I had to share a bed and I was worried about the open end by him. I put the bed rail together exactly as the instructions said and hooked it up to the bed, between the mattress and box spring, per instructions. We both went to sleep and I was awoken in the middle of the night to my baby falling out of the bed. The bed rail simply swung out of the way, doing nothing to stop him from landingon the floor. I do NOT recommend this product!",0
"I have been looking for a diaper bag that would fit everything, after reading all of the reviews and searching I came across this bag. It is quite large, however I had a much smaller bag that I have been using after I put everything in my smaller bag into this one, all of my things made the side pockets stick out. It seemed like I was cramming a ton of stuff into the bag when it really wasn't a whole lot. One of the features that I really liked was the three separate pockets. I thought that I would fit my personal items (phone, keys, wallet) into one of those areas. My items would stick out on the sides making it uncomfortable to carry around. If you are looking for a large bag this is a winner, however don't expect it to be very giving when you put your things into it.",0
"I'm glad that I got this seat for my daughter, she is comfortable in using this and she can place and take the seat by herself from the toilet and this fits most of the toilets. It is a good quality product with great design and worth the extra money, I would highly recommend this product.",1
Love it!,1
"We bought these thinking it would be a great way to make our baby's food.  However, my wife cracked one of the trays on the first use.. and its not like she's a body builder or something.We threw these in the trash and went to the Dollar store and bought ice cube trays for .99 that work better (and don't crack).  Once the food is frozen we dump it out of the trays into a Tupperware bowl, so no need for the ice cube trays to have covers.",0
We bought this for our infant who tried it at her daycare.  We priced it at Target and Babies R Us.  Amazon was the cheapest.She cannot stop jumping. It is a joy to see her so happy and laughing even for a 4 month old.  Best investment and would encourage anyone with a baby to buy this item.,1
"If you are like me and wash out your Medela breast pump parts more than 3-5 times a day, you will definitely be needing these membrane replacements since they rip quite easily.  When my milk seemed to be pumping much less volume, I thought my supply was dwindling, but it was actually the membrane that had torn and didn't allow the pump to suction as well.  As soon as I got the replacement pieces, all was good again.  These are much less than buying them direct from the manufacturer.  A great bargain.",1
Smaller than I thought but still super cute. I would purchase it again as a gift. Love this brand for babies.,1
"Gate is sturdy and well constructed. I bought it preparing for my boy, who isn't even crawling yet, but it's also useful to keep my dogs from going downstairs. I have a 90 and a 30 lb. dog and they can't even make it move. The gate could be a little wider but it fine. I like how easy it is to take out when I need to move large things through and putting back up is just as easy. I ordered two more gates, just the same as this one. I used to have plastic gates but those broke quickly after putting them up, these metal gates are awesome, and especially at this price!",1
I love the spring green color and it is pretty soft. It washes well... for those spitty babies like mine.,1
"We quickly realized that our pack-n-play needed protection when our baby slept in it over night.  While you do have to pull on it and stretch a bit, the bottom line is that it does fit Graco pack and plays.  Its been a life saver.",1
"Other reviews are right, it did take me ~3 minutes to figure out how to separate the two pieces, but once I did this product is great! I am sorry that I did not get this as soon as I bought my Maclaren stroller-- it's so nice to finally have a place to put a drink! Also, the cup holder expands to fit larger bottle sizes which is nice.  Worth the $!",1
"My first breastfed baby would go between bottle and breast with no problem.  We used Avent bottles with her and they worked great.  No leaks, easy to read printing on the bottle, BPA free, easy to wash and use.  Our second baby was sort of a bottle-taking disaster.  She just refused to take bottles.  She would scream and cry and drink just enough to not starve until I got home to nurse her.  She did this for months with us trying to give her a bottle once a week.  We tried several different brands of bottles and this was the one she liked the best.  Finally she would take pumped milk!  I was a little bummed that this bottle was so expensive but if my kid wasn't going to starve herself, I'd pay.There were a lot of things I didn't like about the bottles.  I thought that they were a little difficult to put together so that they did't leak where the bottle body meets the base; the base discolored after two uses; I think vents don't really work and just make things more difficult to clean; 4 parts seemed like too many, it's practically impossible to read the measurement markings on the side; it's crazy expensive.  But I accepted all these cons because my daughter liked this bottle.That was three months ago.  I bought 5 of these bottles since my daughter takes 3 bottles while I'm at work.  TWO of the nipples have broken.  The nipple is a silicone soft nipple permanently attached to a rigid base that screws onto the body of the bottle.  Two of the silicone nipples have detached from the rigid ring at the base.  This is with gentle cleaning and going in a bottle basket on the top shelf of our dishwasher.  This has rendered those two completely useless since there are no replacement nipples.As a note, some might say that since my daughter is 8 months, she shouldn't be using a newborn nipple anyway.  My response to that would be that we've only been using these bottles for 2 and a half months and since most newborn nipples say they are for 0-3 months, the nipples certainly should have held up for at least 3 months.  Secondly, as a company that touts that the bottle mimics breastfeeding, they should anticipate that some parents might want to stay with a slower flow so that baby doesn't get too used to a fast flow and get frustrated with the comparatively slower flow of milk from a breast.All in all, I liked this bottle because my baby accepted it.  Now we've spent a ton of money on bottles that lasted for a couple of months and are on the hunt for a bottle that she will take that we also like.  Again.",0
Got these for my preschool granddaughter.  They fit her perfectly and she loves them.  A nice gift for a girl.,1
I have the Kalani crib which is average sized and this skirt fits big.It's ok. I just shift it back so it sits right..I'm thinking about dying it grey for a lil extra color. It's impossible to find grey skirts,0
"This is a great toy...interesting patterns, cute little song, perfect green legs for little hands to grab, squeaks and jingles! Just don't measure baby's length with it.  It is not accurate unless you really stretch it out.",1
The grandchildren expressly wanted these for their birthday and I could not find them on other sites but was successful with Amazon.  They love them!,1
"It does do what it is supposed to do which is be a booster seat for my daughter so I give it at least 3 stars for &#34;doing its job&#34;.  I am not giving it anymore than that because (1) the cup holder they give you is a waste of time as it will not stay on and just becomes a weapon for your kid to throw and (2) the &#34;covers&#34; that are supposed to snap down on the bottom of the seat over the holes the seat belts come out of basically never stay snapped down and just slide up and down the seatbelt getting the way of the lower belt harness.  I want to try to unthread the entire belt system and take them off sometime but haven't the time yet.  It was overall a good price for what we got, it installed pretty easy, and it does it's job.",0
"We just received today the Comotomo bottle.  The baby( 4 months) latched really quick to the nipple , but after a couple of minutes , I realized that she was sucking but no milk was coming out !!! She was really frustated to work so hard and not get any milk. She is really fussy when she is bottle fed, so far after trying every bottle out there , she only likes the Yoomi bottle, which we really loved but have been having issues with leaks . Does anyone also had problems with the slow and difficulty with the milk coming out of the medium flow nipple?",0
"My husband and I ordered this combo a few weeks ago. The turn around time for shipping was awesome, but that was the best part of our experience. I knew I shouldn't have bought a product I couldn't see and feel up close.... This stroller is highly inconvienient. It does not close easily, the seat tilts at a strange angle (Not the back but the bottom where the child is actually sitting) and the basket looks large but it's not. It's also not easy to utilize as it doesn't move at all. The umbrella that comes with the carseat is awful. It barely covers the baby and is very flimsy. Overall, I doubt this is even worth the 2 stars I rated it at. Save your money and do your research!! We thought we had but if you can't test it in person, you're really taking a risk.",0
"The name of this product is totally misleading!  I picked the """"inner spring"""" mattress because I wanted a mattress with springs.  This is basically the exact same product as the other dream on me foam mattresses with a fancier name and a higher price.  Not satisfied!",0
These spoons work well for us.  The rectangular shape and flexible tip make feeding easy and less messy.  They are also great teethers.,1
My daughter loves this toy!  It's small enough that she can carry it around and the music is loud enough that she can hear it and it doesn't annoy adults!  :),1
"We've had this stool for about 8 months and my 2.5 year old has yet to get it to tip over with all her at-the-sink acrobatics. It's very sturdy and the rubber grips the floor really well.It's not the cutest stool on the market - it's rather basic and, well, it is plastic. But I'll take safety over looks any day!The only negative thing I can think of is that the rubber grips are so sticky that I can't really slide it across the bathroom floor with my foot (when it gets left in front of the sink and impedes the door). I actually have to pick it up and move it. But of course, that's what you want - it shouldn't be sliding around very easily!",1
"After reading many, many reviews, we decided to buy this carseat for our 20 month old, who we are still putting rear-facing, based on its excellent ratings especially when safety is concerned.  Are we ever disappointed!  First off, the installation instructions are difficult to follow - and my husband and I both have PhDs (not in car seat installation, mind you).  Once installed, it still seems wobbly and unstable.  We had intended to use this car seat between my husband's SUV, my MiniCooper, and our nanny's four-door sedan - forget it!  It takes too long to take out and put in another car, so it is staying put in our SUV; I doubt highly it would fit in a much smaller car.  The cushy inserts are nice ... until our daughter pulled them out, as they are only attached via velcro.  The one good thing I have to say about it is that it does look very comfortable, although my tall daughter's legs still have to bend; I'm hoping I'll like it better after her 2nd b-day when we put it front-facing.  If you are looking for a front-facing, comfortable carseat, with excellent safety ratings, that will stay put in one car, and don't mind spending a few frustrating hours (or paying someone to install it) - this is your carseat.  However, if you are looking for a carseat that can easily go from one vehicle to another, or if you have a small-ish car, or if your child is still rear-facing and tall - run far, far away.",0
"We have the crib mattress pad by Tumpety Tots and love it! It gives the crib extra padding and protects very well from any wet ness. I would highly recommend it.Sincerely, Renee Sterner",1
"These are great!  The wipes make it easy to get good coverage on a squirmy toddler. They're also sensitive, my daughter had very sensitive skin and these don't irritate her at all. They are pricey, but we've never had an issue with sunburn.",1
"I purchased the sleep sack when my baby boy was about 3 months old. The weather was getting warmer and he had pretty much outgrown all the sleep gowns we had been using. After moving him out of the bassinet to his crib, it became apparent just how active he was too. The sleep sack helps keep him from getting his legs stuck in the sides of the crib, yet still allows him to roll around and play. It's not too warm, but gives him some coverage in an air-conditioned house. I definitely plan to look at a fleece version for the winter months too. I can't believe I never used these with my first son!",1
"Best blankets I've ever seen. They're breathable, and yet it keeps baby warm, so I feel comfortable wrapping up my baby knowing he can't suffocate on it.Absolutely love these. Planning on buying a couple more.",1
"When we first received this stroller, we loved it!  It handled well--very smooth, easy turns, could be directed with one hand.  My one complaint was that the handle was too short for someone with longer legs.  But as we started using it more and more, we found it was not very ""user-friendly.""  For one, the way it opened was not intuitive.  We had to push it out and forward while pulling up on levers on each side of the handle bar. Forget trying to do this while holding a baby.  Also, the canopy was too small and doesn't meet the baby carrier canopy when used as a travel system.  As a result, to keep the sun off baby, we needed an extra blanket.  These were minor inconveniences, but the real trouble started when my son outgrew the baby carrier and began riding in the stroller solo.  We quickly realized how stupidly designed the harness straps were.  They simply slid into a clip on the back support, so my active son could easily move forward and unclip the straps.  He was still held in the harness, but he was able to move about a little too freely and could easily lean over or forward to grab the wheels.  Too, after about a year and a half of daily use, the handling deteriorated.  The wheels stick when climbing hills and when turning and I constantly have to backtrack to get them realigned.",0
"Happy with the overall look, quality and price. Makes mu baby's crib warm and confortable. I recomand the Jungle Jubilee Fited Sheet.",1
"I bought my first of these Diono mirrors for my SIL at Buy Buy Baby and was so jealous of it that I bought my own and trashed my old mirror.  This mirror has a non-stick back and adjustable strap to ensure that it stays in place no matter HOW fast you take a corner. = ) The mirror is clear as can be, not the milky or wonky fun-house mirrors like the others. Buy this. You won't regret it.",1
My 4 week old daughter uses this swing daily!  It is small enough that I can take it in the bathroom with me.  She swings while I take a shower each morning.  The seat is soft enough that it craddles her and I don't have to worry about her head bobbing around.  It is also easy to take to grandma's house!,1
My son is tall and I bought this with the idea of him growing into it. He has been wearing it for a long time now and never has problems. I would recommend it to friends.,1
Pros: offers hands free pumping. I can read or work on the computer now.Is comfortable enough to sleep in for late night pumpingsCons: A little tight around the underarmsOverall a great buy. I bought one at first to try it out and ended up ordering two more later.,1
I love this wet bag. It's the perfect size for 1 day of diapers (about 10). I wish that I had all this style and especially love that it is made in the USA. Washes really well and dries quickly. No complaints at all.,1
"I GIVE TO MY 8 MONTHS OLD NEPHEW , GOOD PRICE . HE LIKE A LOT . THE BIG REASON FOR ME BUY THIS ONE . IT IS SAFETY .",1
"this is the fourth and final carrier I will try.1. The Moby Wrap... Not sure who has time to wrap 10 feet of fabric around their body. And what new mom wants to look bulkier then she already does/feels. Lastly, my baby hated being stuffed in and out of it.2. The standard baby carrier. I could not use this until my baby was able to support himself, very soon after that he was over 17lbs. not only was carrying this weight on my shoulders painful after just a short time, but it was clearly uncomfortable for his weight to be resting on his crotch. I would frequently have to raise him up and alleviate the pressure he was feeling (i knew this because he would cry like he felt pain) futhermore I would have to make sure he had on shorts or pants when I intended on carrying him in the carrier or he would get marks on his thighs and once developed a rash.3. the sling. sure it's convenient and easy to use, but poor baby who dares to sleep in it! and reaching for anything is impossible.This Ergo wrap  is amazing, My baby is now 21lbs and feels almost weightless in the carrier. The hood is great for a sleeping little one. The pocket on the back is great for easy acess storage. Amazingly this carrier is also extremely easy to put on and get baby in and out. The other great thing about this carrier is that it is good from newborn to toddler!",1
With my first child I took some advice and didn't get a video monitor. People said it would make me check on the baby everytime she stirred. Well after about 6 months I wish I had not taken the advice and had gotten a video monitor because I wanted to see my baby and what she was doing so that I knew whether or not I really needed to go into her room. So with this 2nd baby I decided I would just go ahead and get this video monitor. Now that we have been using this video monitor for two weeks and I LOVE it!!!! We bought an extra camera so that we could have one in each room. The picture is very clear and it is super to switch between cameras. It's so great being able to see what the kids are doing and whether or not they are just stirring in their sleep or if they are really awake without having to go into their rooms and risk them actually waking up.,1
Exactly what I was looking for.  Our baby seat is just too big for an 8 lb baby - this item makes the baby nice and snug and helps to keep her head from flopping around while she is in the baby car seat.,1
I bought this for my 20-month old daughter just so she could get familiar with the potty concept and she immediately loved it and started using it sporadically.  She loves to flush (it makes a cool flushing sound) and now that she's 2 yr. she helps remove it to flush in the big toilet and clean up.  It's a great potty to get started with.  It looks like the real thing but it's perfectly small like our kids!  It helps them feel comfortable with the concept and makes them feel like a grown up to sit on a toilet that looks like the real thing.  It's a good buy!,1
"My wife and I also have the Pro Ride, and Recaro fixed a few things that I didn't know were problems. The shoulder pads are now affixed to the back so they don't move around, and it has a cupholder now.It's just a great seat. Buy one. Or five. I don't care as long as it's at least one.",1
"I have 4 complete sets of Emily Green dinnerware -- bowl, plate, cup, and place mat -- in Sunshine Safari, Mix It Up, Up Above the World, and Dump It. For the past couple of years, they've been my favorite dinnerware for my 3.5-year-old, and I can't wait for my 15-month-old to get big enough to use them too! The artwork is quirky and adorable, but not too cutesy -- my family loves the designs. The dinnerware is also a big hit with my son's little buddies whenever they are over.The cups are great -- perfect size, nice shape that is easy to grip and stable on surfaces, sturdy (ours have been dropped many, many times), and fun to use.  Absolutely no complaints.  They are a good starter cup for the baby too.  Note that when stacking, each cup only fits about halfway inside the next.Amazon had these for the best price, and they definitely are worth the investment so far. Our oldest set is over 2 years old and the color is just as beautiful as our newest set. My only fear is that Emily Green will continue to come out with more fantastic designs and I will have to keep adding to our collection (much to my husband's chagrin!).",1
"It's a really nice play gym, and I really like. My baby loves it. The only problem I have with it is that my baby can easily make it collapse onto himself. Because of how the bars are set, if he kicks one of them, the side folds over on top of him. It doesn't hurt him, but I have to keep going over there and setting it back upright. Other than that, it's a great little playgym.",1
The convenience is great and the size is perfect but I do not like the single seal (Lansinoh bags have a double seal). Medela warns that the seal may separate if milk that is caught in the seal expands when frozen. It also recommends to store the bags upright which takes up more room to store in the freezer.,0
"I love it when a mattress pad really hugs the mattress and this mattress pad does just that!  It also helps the crib sheet stay in place with minimal movement, which is great since my boy is soooo very active!",1
"This chair has been great. It is easy to set up and use and, we think, cleans up nicely. So far excellent for our 14 month old.",1
"Really easy to apply, works very well, and great scent.I've used this at Burning Man for 6 years, and never had a burn.",1
"Are you kidding me? This is disgusting. Any parent that actually purchases this for his or her baby deserves to be stripped of the child and sent directly to jail. Whether it's in regard to penises or ""public enemy number 1,"" it doesn't matter -- it's an abomination, and shit like this shouldn't even be for sale.I'm actually disappointed in Amazon for even listing it.",0
"This was the best and most useful item I received at my shower!  I love that they are lighter than glass and have no plastic parts!  My daughter is 2 months old and I feed her from a bottle for the first time yesterday, with this bottle. (I go back to work in 2 weeks and she will take a bottle).  She did great!  I used slow-flow nipples rather than the medium flow that came with the Pura bottle.  I just came on-line to buy some of the smaller 5 oz.  I think the smaller size will be great to use when I pump my milk at work.",1
Excellent product great value.. We are very happy with this product and highly recommend it. Very good price and good product.,1
"This cart was deliver a little late , but I was surprise so easy was to assemble  and the price perfect.",1
"I bought this tub 4 years ago.  I have a small bathroom with little storage and needed something that I could easily fold and put away.  I had a preemie and was concerned about getting a tub that she could easily slip in.  The reclining option on this tub did the trick.  When she got toddler, I was concerned about durability.  This tub has lasted 4 years!  No problems, no broken parts, no leaks.  Yes, you have to take a few steps to fold this tub, but once you get the hang of it, it's not a big deal.  I usually just fold in the legs and store it flat without deflating the bottom.  I rarely have to add air to the bottom.  I definitely recommend buying this tub.  I love it!  I just wish my daughter had not outgrown it.  Hopefully it will last you 4 years too!",1
My 5 month old seems to like it. It is light enough for him to hold and the buttons are easily pushed.,1
"I found Simplisse easy to use and very gentle. I had to start pumping right away so I was very sore and the pump did not hurt at all, so I really appreciated that. It's easy to store and easy to transport.While at first there appears to be a lot of parts to contend with, it is actually pretty simple to clean and put back together.My only criticism is how loud it is. Granted, I've never used another pump, but if they could work on that, I wouldn't have any complaints at all.",1
"The instructions for the crib were totally wrong and resulted in us putting the crib together wrong the first time.  We had to take it apart and put it back together.  It says to use the long bolts (Part ""F"") to attach the mattress, when in reality, it should be the short bolts (Part ""G"").  Trying to use the long screws in the mattress resulted in us messing up the bolts holes on the mattress.  When you make baby products, please make sure the instructions are correct so that the product can be put together correctly!",0
"These bottles are really awesome! ive used these 99% of the time ive needed to use a bottle. my daughter is 9 months now, shes been breast fed since birth, so the bottles are used pretty much only when my wife isnt availibe. my only gripes with them is they leak abit when they get knocked over & they Get knocked over ALL THE TIME! they're top heavy, they're taller than average bottles & the bottom of the bottle is narrow. if the designer of the Podee bottles is clever enough to come up with this design, he shouldve figured out & solved the topple over problem. the suction hose rests on the bottom, so you pretty much need the bottle upright to drink. i made a bottle holder outta wood for mine thats weighted on the bottom so they dont knock over. although i wouldnt let this stop you from trying these out. other than that, great product, great idea!",1
I absolutely love this car seat!! I have a 2 year old and it's the first time I have seen him actually proud of his car seat. He actually wants to go on an trip and sit proud in his seat.. It is nicely padded. The cup holder pulls out to fit a cuppy nicely and the reclining is very easy to use. Also the should strap adjustment is very easy to use to adjust the shoulder belt. No longer have to take it all apart. A bar in the back is unlocked and relocked when in correct position. LOVE IT!!!,1
"This is a fabulously comfortable car seat, my daughter loves it.  It sets her up high and gives her lots of cushion and padding.  I love the headrest- it actually works to keep her head upright, even when asleep.  It is thick enough to offer support- our newborn carrier/carseat just had a little flimsy headrest.  The cup holders are awesome, and the LATCH system makes it super easy to install in my car or my husband's truck.  Added bonus- my daughter loves the color!  Fits her personality perfectly!",1
"After reading the most popular review written by Kenneth, I purchased 2 of these and put 2 plastic baffles into one cup. The flow was much slower and my son did not spill as much as I expected. He is learning fast and does not really spill much water anymore. I will soon remove the second baffle and see he does. :)I use the second cup (without a baffle) with a straw to give him juice. O",1
"Bags freeze well, never leak.  I have defrosted them in a bottle warmer without them melting or breaking.  One caution: before pouring, cut off the entire top of the bag below the seal line.  I sometimes spill the milk if it pours over the holes on the top of the bag.",1
"I have RA and this has been a wonderful tool because the new carseat has a buckle that is much harder to open, Thank you",1
Great for pumping while traveling,1
"The Snap 'N Go is convenient, lightweight and easy to use. We have the Baby Trend car seat and it works great with this stroller. It folds easily and fits in the trunk of our small station wagon. We use it for shopping, mostly, and it has fantastic manueverability, a smooth ride, and a great big basket! Don't buy a huge travel system - just get your car seat and this stroller. Of course, you'll need another stroller once your child outgrows the infant car seat - but for the price, it's a great value - we've gotten 6 months use out of it so far, with an average-size baby.",1
"I wasn't sure about ordering thank you cards online because I didn't want to end up with cheap cardstock.  But these feel great, they're cute, and they'll be perfect as thank you cards for my 4 yr old's birthday party.  The little tail of the alligator goes around the back of the card, and there's also a little turtle.  Cardstock weight feels great, and the envelopes are a similar beige color and nice, as well.  We usually order stuff from tinyprints.com, but these were a nice find.  Glad I took a chance.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I'd buy these again.",1
"These bib bandannas are wonderful. I really wish that I had picked them up a year earlier when the teething began. They absorb very well, are really adorable as an addition to my son's outfits and are made from a soft terry/velour backed with a layer that breathes while not allowing moisture to irritate the skin. I had been using a bib with plastic inbetween fabric, which did not breathe and caused a terrible rash on his chest. After using Billyz bandanna, the rash has completely healed within three days, to all of our relief! My son is 16 months and on the large side, and we are using the middle snap. He still has room to grow. I just wish I had made the investment earlier. As a first time mom, I underestimated the importance of a proper teething barrier...live and learn! I",1
I bought this for my newborn daughter after buying one for a friend. I was excited to try it as a substitute for swaddling her  in a regular blanket. It worked for the short period of time that I used it. This size of swaddle blanket is outgrown quickly! I thought that with my daughter being born at 5#10oz that she'd be in it for more than a month. I was wrong. She really only used it for 3 weeks.  After that she wanted her hands out and the swaddle blanket became unnecessary to use.  I'll probably use it again If we have any more children.,1
"I bought this set because of the curved lip on the bowl, which I thought would help my 19-month-old toddler better manage getting food on his spoon.  It works okay for that, although along one side, the lip sticks out so far that he actually gets his utensil caught on it and ends up moving the bowl all over the place.  The utensils are also quite large/wide - not a good thing for toddlers who are not the most precise when putting things in their mouth.  As another reviewer indicated, the suction cup bottom is detachable - an awful idea.  I am looking for ease and simplicity, not more parts to keep track of.  I bought theBoon Toddler Catch Bowl with Spill Catcherbowl at the same time, and far prefer it because the suction is stable and it is all one, nearly seamless, piece.",0
This is a great potty seat and stool.  My 2 year old son loves the Cars print and wants to use the potty.  He also sits on it longer because he likes looking at the pictures. He's proud of his potty seat and stool.,1
"Fantastic light weigh booster seat.  I bought this booster for my 14 month old boy as we were travelling to Paris and restaurants do not normally carry high chairs.  This seat folds flat so takes up virtually no space and is extremely light yet sturdy.  It fitted every chair in every restaurant that we ate at.  The straps are long and short enough to fit any chair.  As most mom's with boys will know they do not sit still, at one point my son was completely leaning over to try get something off the floor that he spotted, the seat straps held him in and the seat itself did not budge. In Europe tables are extremely small and table attached chairs could pull the whole table over therefor not an option. It is extremely easy to set up and take off/pack up - less than 30 seconds. It was the perfect height for my son to enjoy his time at the table. Well done Brica for making an excellent booster.",1
"I have the toddler Shrunks bed and really like it, which is why I ordered the kid's bed.  Unfortunately, what was shipped to me was not what was described on the site.  Both the image shown, and the description (&#34;Designed to tuck in sheets and blankets&#34;) are incorrect.  There is no separation between the brown-lined sleeping area and the bumpers, so no standard sheet size will fit this bed.  The toddler Shrunks bed I previously bought (directly from the Shrunks), does have this separation and fits standard crib sheets.  Product is misrepresented.",0
"I've taken my baby on many trips now, accompanying my husband on business trips and visiting extended family all over the US. All of this traveling would've been awful without this crucial little item. Moving through airports is a breeze, she sleeps very soundly in her carrier so she hasn't missed a nap no matter what crazy stuff I've been doing, and I've had my hands free to take photos in all the amazing places I've seen with her, from Manhattan to New Orleans to Seattle. She's remained safe in big, bustling cities, and easily brought off the beaten path on all manner of trails in the forest. I simply wouldn't be able to live the way I do with an infant any other way.",1
i did not get my product that was for my little cousins an they are very disappointed that they didnt get anything it said that it is in lathrop an it had past tracy were i live,0
"I, along with many other parents, have the issues of children getting into things that they don&#8217;t need to get into. Thankfully for you, manufacturers like dreambaby, have made the Dreambaby Sliding Locks as a tool to prevent your children safe from harm&#8217;s way.&#9654; Package Contents:2 x Dreambaby Sliding Locks (From the package I obtained, however, Amazon has packs that come in multiples of 3)1 x Advertisement paper&#9654; SpecificationsItem Weight: 4 ouncesProduct Dimensions: 9 x 2.5 x 0.5 inchesUPC: 878931007159Item model number: L715Target gender: UnisexNumber of items: 1&#9654; Hardware:The sliding lock is a very simplistic white gloss plastic, which has a U-shaped base with a sliding mechanism. The U-shaped base has a flat surface for 2.75 inches to allow space in-between the cabinet doors, and then a jagged surface for 5 inches before reaching the stopper. The sliding mechanism has the dreambaby logo on the top and bottom face, and push buttons on each side to release the mechanism freely. The sliding lock acts like a zip tie, or cable tie, which can only be tightened more by pulling on the device, and cannot be released until both buttons on the sliding mechanism is pushed.I overall like the design of this device, as it can only get tighter when pulled upon, and feel more secure around my mischievous children, but know that this is a tool that doesn&#8217;t substitute my supervision.&#9654; SetupSetup is fairly easy, as all you have to do is take the sliding mechanism to the stopper. This will allow you to maneuver the sliding lock around your cabinet fixtures, whether that would be a pull or knob, and then take the sliding mechanism back to the closest point in between the fixtures.&#9654; TestingAfter I successfully installed the sliding lock (as seen from my two product images) I start attempting to pull onto the locking mechanism to open the sliding lock. Any pulling and tugging only tightens the lock, and only pressing one button won&#8217;t open it either. I would use this for my children but wouldn&#8217;t completely trust the plastic design either. Even if my children wouldn&#8217;t comprehend the locking mechanism, they probably could break the plastic by pulling on the locking side and then moving the locking mechanism. As I said before, it isn&#8217;t a complete substitute to my supervision, but it does buy time to prevent them from getting into things that they don&#8217;t need to get into.&#9654; Final ThoughtsI like this product, because it is a guard to prevent my kids from getting into things that they don&#8217;t need to get into, but isn&#8217;t perfect because it is made out of a breakable plastic. Because of this design flaw, I have to take off one star, to give this product a 4 out of 5 rating. I understand that this was a cost effective design, but manufacturers should understand that parents would pay more if it means the safety of their children.Pros:+ Cheap but simple plastic design; made to be bought in bulk for several cabinets.+ Sliding mechanism locks when pulled, preventing any pulling t+ Easy setup, and compatible with the pull fixture of my cabinets.Cons:- Made of a cheap plastic that is easily breakable.I was provided a sample from the P & G Safe Home program.",1
"I actually had to return the high chair, as there were several defects.  There were cracks in the wood, rough spots that should have been better sanded and inconsistencies and haziness in the finish.",0
"My 13-mo old is CRAZY about photos of family, babies, animals, etc.  This was one of her favorite Christmas gifts. I put pictures of family and our animals in it and she was absolutely delighted and did not want to put it down on Christmas morning.",1
Product works! I was skeptical but it cleared my baby's nose and he loved it!!! It a must have for parents that have babies and children.,1
I love the design on the product. Easy to put together and well built. Will definitely purchases more products from company when needed.,1
"This was our third cast for the third child. Only 1 of 5 plaster rolls was proper in terms of the consistency it became after being soaked in water. The other four remained hard and crumbly, even after soaking individual pieces for 15 minutes (the good roll became right as soon as it hit the water). We were unable to get a good cast out of this kit. We got one good layer with the good roll, and our attempt at a second layer resulted in a falling apart mess. SO Diapppointing!",0
"These canvas pictures are absolutely adorable. They went perfectly with the baby nursery theme and the person I got it for loved them.Shipping could have been a bit quicker, but was pleased",1
"the swing is great and my 2 months old daughter get comfortable in the seat and she adores the fish hanging on top..I just want to warn parents not to place the baby in the swing mode after a feed, because when i did, she vomited ...Overall, Great Swing..",1
"I thought it was even better when I received  the items than when I saw them online.  I am making a nursery for my granddaughter, and it can be used for a boy or girl.",1
"Give you hand free, and easy to use! Before I didn't purchase it, and always hold bottle by hand, and give me hard time sometimes, but now it is much easier.",1
These bad boys are so cute! We haven't put them up just yet because we can't decide on a layout yet but we can't wait until they're on the wall of our baby's room,1
I bought this pump after a few friends raved about it.  I never found it to be helpful and wonder if I'd have been successful with bf if I hadnt' rented a hospital grade pump.  I now use the Pump in Style and it works great.  Don't waste your money on this pump.  I love the Avent bottles and nipples though.,0
"Some suggest that the bigger the better, so I got this size.  I am a D cup with nursing and a C before.  The one that came with my pump seemed way to small, so I got the biggest size based on reviews.  It works better, but I'll have to get a smaller size.  Using this size seems to drasticly reduce the amount of suction I get with my manual hand pump.  Too bad you can't just buy one to try it!",0
"This was a great deal for a Petunia Bag - understanding that it was a older design (who cares, right?) The bag came on-time and in great condition. Would recommend purchasing! The bag is HUGE and has lots of room for must-have baby items (great for 2 kids!)",1
"First of all, the bedding arrived two days after I purchased it. Unbelievable!Second of all, it is the most beautiful thing I've seen in a long time.  The quality is exquisite!  I'm so in love with this set.",1
"I found the wedge to be too firm/hard for me - it felt like rolling only a block, rather than a supportive pillow.",0
this is a great product. it makes mixing formula so much easier. anyone with kids should try it.,1
"There is another version of this product I bought at Target that is installed using screws & tools.  This product is just as good, and takes mere seconds to install using the sticky pads included in the package.  These locks have kept my 2yo twins out of my cabinets and protected them from the cleaning products under the sink.  GREAT product!",1
"This is one of the best breastfeeding products I have ever tried. Especially usefull for the first few weeks. They keep clothing off of sensitive nipples, which makes things much more comfortable. They also allowed me to collect several ounces of breastmilk at each feeding to freeze for later. that liquid gold would have gone to waste otherwise!! I have told all of my pregnant friends to get them and will be recommending them to everyone who will listen. more than worth the money!",1
"I liked the moby from 0-3 months because they got to be very close.  My baby was a march baby so it wasn't too hot. I didn't have any extra back pain. Your still lugging around something ... and I have a degenerative disc in my back, so you might have to get use to it. I dunno.  I found this to be amazing when you went to the store or out to eat because the baby is all cozy next to you.  It takes some practice to learn to tie anything you haven't tied before... there is no instant gratification but honestly it took less than 2 minutes for me to tie.  I tied this in the house before I went out and then when I was where I wanted to go I just popped the baby from his car seat into the moby.  My girlfriends have told me the ergo baby is better for older babies so I'm going to give the a try this time.",1
"I LOVE this stroller. I consider it a full size umbrella stroller. Folds ultra small. It stays in my SUV, use it multiple times daily, 5 point harness, has fun convenient storage, has a huge canopy and reclines. Folds to the size of an umbrella stroller. I have had so many questions and compliments on it. LOVE IT. We don't use anything else. In fact, we got rid of our old full size stroller. I'm telling you, I couldnt be happier. I use it all the time, every where, and it is so easy to fold and unfold. Like I said, it folds to the size of an umbrella stroller, but is more like a full size stroller.",1
"My 4 month old is now producing buckets of drool, and I'm changing his bib 4 times a day minimum. I needed to add to his collection, so I got these because they were cheap. They are actually my favorite now. Vivid colors that last through washing, thick & absorbant, and super soft. Wouldn't change a thing.",1
"The baby loves it.  Friends and family are so jealous, everyone else has those other ugly cheap brands.  My daughter deserves the best, always!!!",1
Loved the Bag!! Very good Quality!!! Will definitely buy another one for a gift!! The color is awesome! Very Spacious!!,1
"I got this gate to keep my dogs in one room.  It does the job fine.  I don't know if the dogs really jumped on it if it would stay in place though.  I have bought another brand (Carlson) that seems to have sturdier hardware and latching mechanism.  For the price, though, this was a good buy.",0
"When i recieved this item we were anxious to test it out in hopes that we could avoid getting a big bulky high chair since my daughter is nearing 6 months and we are about to start her on baby food soon. We live in a small apartment and its already taken over by her jumperoo, storllers, carseat, toys etc. The last thing we needed was to add a big 'ol high chair to the mix. I looked at alot of different types of these and it seems like for all of them, the reviews are pretty much split. I took a chance on this one hoping that it would at least be decent enough for the price. At first we had huge problems getting it on our dining room table, not because of the skirt, but because of the piece in the middle underneath that extends out to make the table bigger for when there's company over. it kept being blocked from fully hooking up to the table because this big piece of wood table was in the way. next we tried to open the table up (very inconvenient because its huge when opened up and takes up so much room) so when that didnt work we were almost ready to send it back when we thought of trying to remove the piece underneath if possible and then trying to put the chair on. well, finally it worked! now its fully secure on there, its not going ANYWHERE. this was ok for us since we rarely ever used the extended part so we put that in storage. Now my daughter will be ready to start on new foods which i know shes going to love! This chair seems like it will be easy to clean. it looks like it unsnaps for removal of the material so if it gets all icky from spilt food, you should be fine.",1
"I cannot believe my grandbaby has 6 teeth, and these really seem to help with the teething pain!  I am a BELIEVER!",1
I just got these yesterday and couldn't wait to use them on my lil' girl.  She's 6 months now and loved it! She takes a little more time to finish her bottle on which she didnt complained at all and the best of all...there's no spill or leak !! Love the colors and the design is really cute. Definitly will buy more !!,1
I should have read reviews prior to buying the product. I bought the item because the Medela wipes are expensive (although great). So when I saw the price on these wipes and the amount in each package I figured why not give it a try. I ordered two on the spot. Then a day or two later noticed the price went down so I ordered two more. I jumped the gun. The first order came in and I was so disappointed with the product. As the other reviews mention. The wipes are super small about 3inches and I need to use 5-6 wipes to clean all parts of my pump. The smell of the wipes is also bad and it's sticky. I so regret buying!,0
"I received this swing as a shower gift. My 5 week old son loves it. I love that it has an AC adaptor because he sometimes swings away an entire nap and if were only battery powered we'd have take out a loan to keep us in batteries! The swing has nice strong swing action, we only turn the speed to about 1/4 full speed so it seems there will be plenty of speed as he gains weight. I also love the different sound options and the mirror on the mobile. I would definitely recommend this swing to everyone!",1
I ordered this diaper bag because I am expecting a little girl. I love the material and it is the perfect size!,1
"I had preemies and this was too big for a long long time, but I had them padded, swaddled and pinned the head cushion back and it worked out just fine.Now that they are 9 pounds 22 inches..they're finally fitting into this seat.  One LOVES to sleep in it. At first I kept putting her in there as after feeding I was worried about whether she was well burped once I had to get on with her sister, this chair seemed to not only keep it all down but doubles as her cozy nest.  The attatched blanket(removeable) it great for tucking them in. The music loop is tiring but def. more soothing than the Kick and play bouncer we have...what a short lived item.We do have to keep it at a tilt with a cushion at the foot because it's too much of a tilt and they slide down quite a bit.  They're  almost 3months..I know we have much time to go still with this chair.It's really nice fabric and not obnoxious like a lot of other items out there. Soothing for both of us. Thinking about the swing now...it must be as great as this papsan, right?",1
Loved this thick padded knee rest. It makes kneeling at the tub to wash baby so much more comfortable. A fun design too.,1
I don't know how I did not know about this product when nursing my first child.  For both of my kids my non-nursing side has leaked while I nursed on the other side.  For my older child I used my pump parts and a bottle to catch the milk and always made a huge mess of trying to balamce it and the baby...not to mention it was awkward and uncomfortable to hold that in place.  This product is so great and I am able to catch at least a bottle a day and not have to pump!  I go back to work in just over a month and will have a great freezer stash thanks to this.,1
I had an older model of the manual ISIS pump with the flat valves and they would pop out if I squeezed too hard or pumped for more than a second or two. I was so glad to find these new duckbill valves and even more happy to find that they fit my older model pump. Now I can pump away forever without having to stop to replace the valve! Highly recommend!,1
Love love love these! Make self feeding for my 7 month old easy! Highly recommend the soft tips for young babies! They're perfect and they don't leak!,1
"My 2 sons, 5 years old and 2 years old, share a bedroom. The oldest cannot sleep in the dark, so we had a nightlight plugged into the wall, which worked great until it came time to put the younger in a toddler bed. He would pull out the nightlight and play with it and the socket. The T-Rex Kinderglo nightlight has solved the problem for us. Both of them can operate it and play with it and no one will get hurt. Now the elder can sleep better and the younger is safer. Thank you for such a wonderful product.",1
"I like this carrier but am not a fan of the buckles. The three point locks are very difficult to do by your self- especially to do by yourself behind your back or with your non-dominant hand.I like the make of it; its very well constructed. It relieves a lot of pressure on my back when carrying my girls. I have put both my 12 pound baby and my 27 pound toddler in it.Toddler: My toddler loves riding piggy back, so being able to do the back/rucksack hold with her is great. I can do both the back and side carries with my toddler with comfort. I'm sure its different for everyone but the back carry is the easiest for me to get her in and out of, and me out of.Infant: I like the head rest for stabilizing my infant's head when I'm doing the front carry. My infant fusses in the side carry position, and she feels wobbly like she's going to slide out the sides- I think the side position will be better when she's larger.",0
"The design is good and material used looks of high quality. My son loves the snack bowl so much and tries to grab it out of the pod all the time. However the clamp is not as strong as it's supposed to be. I tried to tighten it over the side bar of our Chicco Ct0.6 stroller and it would be easily knocked out of position. I imagine it would work better on a horizontally positioned bar as seen on some stroller models. I will bear with it since I still like the overall quality, but need to watch out for spill accidents.",0
"Hands down the best child car seat available. Not only is it the most versatile, I believe it is the safest. I am a firefighter/paramedic and I have installed hundreds of infant car seats over the years and I have NEVER seen any thing that can compare to the Diono RadianRXT! I honestly believe it will set a new standard for not only the industry, but for safety requirements. It brings me great comfort knowing that my son will be riding in this seat from now until the time he will no longer need a booster. This seat looks like it was pulled out of a race car or perhaps a fighter jet! I only wish Diono made adult car seats! This seat may be more money than some other seats out there, but believe me, you will not be disappointed AND you will not need to buy another one as your child grows! It is the sturdiest, most engineered child car seat you can buy and your child deserves the best.",1
"I agree with a past review that this toy is too loud.  You can't even hear the music when the balls are bouncing around.  But that is not my problem.  The hole that you drop the balls in on the top of the treehouse is not on the top as it appears in all pictures on the web site, on this website, on the box, even in the instructions inside.  The hole to put the balls in is in the front of the tree.  It requires a completely different skill set to use this.  It is not a 6 month toy.  I called to complain and was treated terribly and told ""we know about it.  There is a disclaimer ont he box that contents can differ from picture.""  THAT WAS THEIR ANSWER TO ME!!!  I thought that was pretty crappy.  My 13 month old son cannot even figure out how to get the balls in that hole.What poor poor cusomter service.  I even talked to a manager and got that same poor and rude service.",0
Nice looking clock that goes very well with the nursery's Noah's ark theme but the size of this product is really deceiving. I was expecting it to be a bit bigger for a wall clock.,0
These holiday bibs are nice and thick...perfect for teething babies like my twins. They will look nice over holiday outfits and not ruin pictures.,1
"Anyone famliar with feeding a baby knows that bubbles inside a bottle often lead to bubbles inside the baby.  Playtex has addressed this with an innovative concept, allowing air to circulate from tha bottom of the bottle. The first thing you will notice is the lack of bubbles inside the bottle, followed by the lack of the familiar ""air sucking"" sound so many infants make due to sucking in air instead of formula or milk. Less air in equals less air out.  We all know what that means.  This simple idea has finally found solid engineering and design by the people at Playtex.  Worth giving a try.",1
"This is a great diaper cover! Good quality, easy to clean or wipe down, I like the extra layer of velcro to keep leaks in, and easy to put on & off.",1
This is the perfect diaper pail.  It keeps the smells in the pail and when the bag gets full it's easy to remove and replace the bag.,1
"This is a great product for a little girls room or nursery.  This is the second one that we have purchased, we purchased the first one three years ago when our first daughter was born and now we bought the pink one for her little sisters nursery.  They are easy to install on your own and they are the perfect size for smaller rooms and give off a good light.  We really love them and they give the room the look that every little girl wants!",1
"My son is >97th%ile in height and weight for his age 6.5 months, but he's still not quite sitting up on his own yet.  So I wanted to get a cart cover to help support him, because lifting his carrier seat has gotten so heavy and we're needing to size up to one of the toddler seats already.  Previously, we have put the carrier seat into the shopping cart (not on the seat part, because of safety concerns), but that leaves very little room for groceries.  But these shopping cart covers are ridiculously priced and some of the patterns are awful.  I'm not a germaphobe, but have to admit that the idea of him teething on the shopping cart rail is a little unsettling--plus the thought that various raw meats, etc. in this part of the cart.  This one was a good price, so I figured no loss if it didn't work.  But it's great.  It's just enough support for him (though I still keep my hands nearby at all times for when he falls to the side and can't quite get back up on his own).  It's easy to put on with one hand while carrying him in the other.  And this pattern is a lot cuter in person than it looked in the picture.  So I would recommend this.",1
"Perfect size , very easy to put together( I did it without my husband) I am a first time grandma if twins so I ordered two of these . Very pleased!",1
"I love this stroller.  It is so easy to use, light weight, easy to push, easy to fold up and store!  I use it with the car seat and it is super easy to attach and un-attach!",1
"I purchased this for my 2 year old (30 pounds) since she will no longer use the stroller, yet gets tired and refuses to walk.  We were heading to Atlanta for a weekend of museum, zoo, aquarium, etc... and I knew we'd end up carrying her at some point.  She's too heavy for the mai tai and I wanted something with more structure, but not a frame pack.  My friend had an ergo baby and kinda liked it, this was less expensive and fit larger people.  She did really well in it and the best part was how comfortable it was to carry her in it.  Even after 1-2 hours, no sore back!  It does take some getting used to adjusting the straps and figuring out how to put her in while wearing it, but we found a few tricks and were able to do it alone.  We are not small people and there was plenty of room in the straps to adjust to me and my husband, and it has really neat elastic bands to wrap and secure excess strapping.  In fact my husband who never carried her in the sling or mai tai carried her most of the week.",1
"It's a beautiful frame, but they really should clearly state the size. The frame is tiny, and I was expecting something like a 5x7, this is much smaller than that. I ordered it as a Christmas present for my Great-niece, now I'm embarrassed to give it because of it's size. Guess I'll have to make one last purchase to go with the frame.It really is a sweet gorgeous little thing...I just so wish it were larger. I feel like I've been duped.This is the link associated with the frame I purchased. As you can see, there is no mention of its size: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012Q5F0Q/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title",1
got this for my three month old daughter. she loves holding on to the black and white ring on the butterfly and tries to chew on it because she is teething already. great item for a young one learning to grab and pick up toys. lightweight for someone so tiny too,1
"This lunch box was fine, it was a little narrower than I would have liked ( doesn't fit a plastic sandwich holder very well. ) - if careful with it it should hold up for the year at least.",0
I can't wait for it to get colder so my daugther can wear these leg wamers with her UT outfits.,1
"These squirt toys are adorable. I originally bought them for the beach, but have since moved them to the bathtub. My 14 month old loves them. They hold quite a bit of water and can have a powerful squirt, so beware once your little one gets the hang of squeezing them.I've seen some reviews complaining about &#34;mold&#34;. I fill mine with a little bathroom cleaner each time I clean the bathroom and rinse them out. So far, I haven't had a problem, but that's the nature of bath toys that you can't reach to clean. They're not expensive so just replace them if it becomes a problem.",1
"my daughter loves her jumper, we started using it around 4.5 months. we use it in our tv room which has a double opening so we dont have any trouble with smashed fingers. she is short but chunky, 25"" and 17lbs. and we have no trouble with adjustments.",1
"This has really saved our carpets and floors, but the material is somewhat thin and has a tendendcy to fold over and wrinkle up.  This can cause a few minor tripping accidents if left that way.Overall it does what is claims, but it could be a little thicker material.",1
"Originally I was going to return this item. Life got busy and I kept it. What I have decided, for me personally, is that this carrier works best for 18 pounds plus and when the infant is a bit longer. Otherwise there is an awkward moment where the legs aren't quite right for the length of the child. I loved the Solly baby wrap before this carrier, the bamboo material is nice and lightweight. I thought it was a bit overpriced until I started sourcing bamboo fabric for a project and discovered that for the amount of material the Solly has the price is not over the top. Plus I am thrilled to support the couple who makes them as a small business. Back to the Onya...The straps are perfect. They are thinner but offer substantial padding. Baby gets very calm. Does not always like the sun shade but that is easy to tuck in. I am not thrilled with the &#34;seat&#34; which we haven't used because the hard plastic parts are in the pocket on the babies back and I am not entirely sure they don't dig in.I am comfortable in this for longer stretches of time and the straps on the Onya, compared to Ergo, are thinner/wider which I appreciate.On a side note, I was very pleased to see on Onya's site (which is very helpful) a &#34;real&#34; sized mom demonstrating the product. A small detail but all those details add up to a company worth supporting with a great product.",1
This product is great!  I wish I knew about it sooner.  It hold the straws from sippy cups upright during cleaning.  I have been using it for several months now and it is showing no sign of wear.  This would make a great gift!,1
"I bought this after looking for a mobile that doesn't need wound up.  It never fails, that my 2 month old was almost asleep when her mobile would shut off, and she would wake up when I wound it up.  In the month I've had this, she has not cried once when going to bed, and is fast asleep before it shuts(plays for 8 minutes).  If, in rare cases, I need to play it again, all it takes it pushing one button - which doesn't startle her and defeat my previous efforts. I am buying this for all the baby showers I go to from this point on!",1
"I used this drying rack for 10 months while my son bottle fed and it held up well. It is very easy to assemble & I didn't even need to reference the instructions for once!The best aspect of the product is that it holds A LOT of items. Also, you have 2 options regarding where you can store the rack: you can place it on the counter and utilize the draining tray provided or you can place it in the sink and allow it to drain there.The biggest downfall I have found is the instability of the rack. The support rod in the middle wobbles quite a bit. Also, the turn table on the top doesn't fit snuggly around the support rod which causes it to lean to one side. Every time I try to adjust this portion it ends up falling down to the bottom of the support rod, I get frustrated after numerous attempts to reattach it and resort to having my much more patient husband put it back together!Because the rack is a little bit of an eye sore due to its size, I have chosen to place it in the right half of my sink in order to limit its visibility to visitors. This method has proven to be functional and allows us to wash/dry a large quantitiy of items at one time.Overall, if you are looking for a rack that holds a large quantity of items (bottles, nipples, pacifiers, spoons, etc) and is relatively inexpensive this will get the job done in its own wobbly way. However, if you are looking for more stability (ie. glass bottles) or need less room for drying there are other products sold on this website that will better meet your needs.",0
"A great stroller for the park and outdoors. It does take of lots of room in my minivan thus, not something that I keep in there all the time like I would want. The cup holder that attaches on the handle comes off too easy and has been misplaced. Also, the fenders for the back wheels come off too easily and seem flimsy. I don't think I will bother replacing it. I wish it sat up one or two positions higher. I think newer models do.",1
Got this as a spare car seat for grandparents vehicle. We have same one in a different pattern that we used until little one could forward face. Good car seat for the money.,1
"Great invention. My whirlpool tub is in the center of the bathroom so there are no walls to hold on to. It also helps hold the towels so I can dry without getting too much water on the floor. It does get loose from the suction cups sometimes, but that's no biggie for me. It's cheaper than hiring a pro to install actual hardware grips if it were even possible.",1
This product was purchased to make a &#34;daddy diaper bag&#34; for my husband to make him feel included in our pregnancy.  It looks just like the picture and is very soft.  I think he will love it!,1
"This potty chair LEAKS VERY BADLY!!!!! Pee gets on the floor EVERY stinkin' time AND on my son's feet. The opening is WAY to small to go number 2 in. It is very messy business to clean up afterwards. I am VERY disappointed with it. Buy this ONLY if you want to waste your money. Plus, the sensors for the music are WAY to sensitive and go off when no one is even in the room! Ugh. :(",0
"It came in on time, and in perfect condition. It may not be big, but it's soo cute! And I think it's such a nice little gift for the price. Plus it was shipped in bubble wrap, haha who doesn't lkke that?",1
"This tray is a good idea in theory, but if your child is like mine, they will be able to easily remove the tray.  It does not lock into place.",0
Our baby loves the bouncer and spends a lot of time playing on it! I think it is a great value for money - highly recommend this product.,1
"Product gets wet when it defrosts so the interior of your lunch bag will be coated in water.. Really dislike that. Swapped out for a different brand and type of coolers. Do not recommend this, unless you want your lunch bag always wet.",0
This was a gift for our great grandsson. I was pleased with the packaaging and the sheet AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN SEEMED TO LIKE IT.,1
"I have Bumgenius 4.0 and Bambino Mio Miosolo... Bambino Mio Miosolo is much more absorvent than Bumgenius and fits better, they are taller so no leaks at all!!! I was amazed!!! since it's a new brand i was worried buy now i regret having bought the Bumgenius, i've should have bought ONLY BAMBINO MIO MIOSOLO!! they are the best!! better fabric quality than Bumgenius also!",1
Best addition to my baby daughter's crib. Bumper is thick and super cute. I bought a cheaper one but it wasnt as thick nor as cute as Carter's. I recommend it.,1
"My daughter loved it. It's easy to put together. The cup holders are great. Two little things I would change. 1. The arm rests don't flip up for easier in and out of car. 2. The seat belt loop where the seatbelt goes through the car seat binds a little. Other then that, we love the seat.",1
"We tried a number of different solutions for storing bath toys and have finally found one that works for us.  Unlike the storage units that store the toys up high, this is always accessible to my daughter and also makes it easy for her to tackle &#34;clean-up&#34; on her own, when it's time to drain the water and put toys away.  It drains the water well so toys don't get moldy.",1
"I just received this bedding set for my pending baby boy.  It is absolutely beautiful!  The workmanship is wonderful.  The color and details are more than I had expected from the pictures I had seen.  I put it on my gift registry without ever seeing it in person, and trust me, it has exceeded every expectation!A wonderful product and value for all that you get in the set!",1
"When we registered for this high chair, it was priced at $299.  Now it is offered at $349.  Big difference.  Also, it says that this product does not comply with US Safety Standards.  How can you sell a baby high chair that doesn't meet safety standards?",0
"What I love about this gate:- Easy to assemble, took me less than 10 minutes- Easy to adjust, the two main poles twist to adjust in length- The netting is durable and not a complete eye sore- Hold in place well, my kid likes to run into the netting for fun and it doesn't budge out of place- Price, it's cheap but doesn't act cheapWhat I dislike- Obviously you get what you pay for, it doesn't have a door in the middle so it's ideal for an area where you don't have to jump over it every 10 minutes. I put it in a high traffic area of our house, between the kitchen and our livingroom. Big mistake, I'm jumping over this thing ALL the time and it has become a huge inconvenience. ***If you are overweight and can't lift your legs very high a lot this is NOT for you, my mother in law dreads this thing and it's quite hilarious to watch her go over it :D",1
"I have been wanting to try these wipes for a long time now, and finally took the plunge to get them.  I wanted to use them primarily as wipes for baby but have ended up using them for much more!  They are my absolute favorite washcloth for washing baby.  They are soft but also have enough strength to them that they can gently scrub off dirt and food from my baby's face.  I also love having a stack of them in the bathroom for myself to use.  I dip them in coconut oil as the perfect make-up remover at the end of the day.  I've even used these wipes to wipe down the tub/shower!  They are a really nice size and shape, allowing for so many uses.  A lot of wipes are too small to get the job done or too big to be convenient to use.  These wipes are perfect!  They wash up beautifully and are durable while remaining soft.  I can't say enough about these wipes!  I am constantly impressed by Babykicks products!",1
I spent months researching car seats and finally made my purchase. I love everything about it! By far one of the best purchases I have made.,1
"The word SOLID cannot be associated with Dream On Me.  I purchase this toddler bed from Baby's R uS and hated it from day one.  I tried to like but as I was putting it together it just felt flimsy and later I would find out how dangerous it would become.  I almost cracked a rib kissing my little one good night on his first night transitioning from the crib to this bed as the footboard snapped off and the remaining jagged edge meeting my rib cage.  A very traumatizing event for my sons first night on his new bed.  Till this day, he keeps reminding us of ""daddy's booboo"" because after many tries to get the foot board replaced, the pieces just don't align at all. Thus we still have that jagged edge (TRUE STORY).  UPDATE:  8 months later the side rail has cracked.  Going to try theP'kolino Toddler Bed and Chair, Whitewhich it states can support up to 300LBS but even if it doesn't it has really great review on AMAZON with regards to its SOLIDNESS.UPDATE 01.30.2012:My little boy is now almost 5 years old and hisP'kolino Toddler Bed and Chair, Whiteis still SOLID as a rock.  Within this time we had another boy and when it was time to purchase his big boy bed, we purchased yet again theP'kolino Toddler Bed and Chair, White.  It was a no brainer.  I took a picture that I'll have to post of me @275 LBS, my oldest son @52 LBS and my youngest @41 LBS all laying/sitting on the newP'kolino Toddler Bed and Chair, White.  Try that on Dream On Me, etc...",0
I started using pockets which were recommended by many friends who cloth diaper. I wasn't impressed with the pockets so I ordered this pack. I am not in love with cloth diapering all over again and I will continue to use prefolds.,1
"Un producto demasiado practico para que todo lo que se lave de teteros y dem&aacute;s accesorios para alimentar al bebe, no tenga contacto con otros elementos.A product too practical to wash everything from bottles and other accessories to feed the baby, no contact with other elements.",1
best cup ever ! does not spill easy to assemble last a long time and I like how the straw is protected when you are on the go!,1
"My son was born in 2012- year of the dragon, so this was perfect!  It's absolutely adorable and very detailed with the cute blue wings which is ideal for a boy.",1
"Good quality, but I've noticed my standard sized sheets fit a little snug, might be that these corners are a bit wider.",1
Unfortunately I should say that the product is not so good because it doesn't recline and my baby must sleep almost in an upright position.,0
"I thought this was the cutest thing when our 4 month old daughter got it as a present.  Now at nearly 5 months, she loves it and enjoys chewing on it... and that's where the danger lies.  The antlers are not quite big enough to be safe.  Our daughter managed to wedge the end of the antler into her mouth, and due to the jagged shape, couldn't get it out.  She started to gag on it and couldn't get it out of her mouth.  Her face turned all red and her eyes were watering.  Luckily her mom and I were right at hand and were able to pull it out of her mouth, but we definitely won't be letting her play with it without very close supervision.Parents of toddlers and young babies, please be aware of the danger.  Because of the shape, I am pretty sure her air passage was not cut off, but it was still very scary for her and us.  I definitely do not recommend you let your child play with this toy unattended, or even in the back seat of the car, unless there's someone watching constantly.I'm sorry to give this cute and very engaging toy such a bad review, but it is simply not a safe toy.",0
"Im impresssed with how fast I recieved this item, I live in the Arabian Gulf and got it 4 days after I placed the order, the quality is amazing and its better than I expected.the image reflects the actual colors, I also bought the zigzag bumper and grey bed skirt.  Im happy!!!",1
It came before it was supposed to and so the delivery was good. I am excited to use this once the baby gets here,0
"Something every parent needs.  Wubbanubs are genius, adorable and make all those other binkys obsolete.  We get so many compliments, my daughter loves them and you'll never lose another binky or have to search to find it in the dark again.  Part binky, part lovey.",1
"I don't know why, but my 6-month old baby LOVES the Green Sprouts Silicone Teethers.  I bought them because they are (supposedly) BPA-free, PVC-free and phthalate-free product.  I like that they're colorless since it makes me think that there might be one-less chemical used in the teether, but I wasn't sure if my baby would like them since they don't have fancy pictures/colors.  But, BABY LOVES this soft, flexible, and light-weight teether.  It's her FAVORITE.  Mom couldn't be happier knowing it's a BPA-free, PVC-free and phthalate-free product.  THANK YOU GREEN SPROUTS!!!",1
"when I received as a BaybyShower gift I said, well lets see if this one is same as diaper genie, but I was totally wrong this one is the best in my point.Hold a lot of diapers,and I never have any nasty odor coming out of this I have it in the baby's room sometime I have diapers for a week and the room is odorless. And is fashionable after baby is done with diapers I can use it in the bathroom or kitchen.Thank you, for a great product.",1
"This bouncer is good deal, I got it for my friends kid. I am sure he is enjoying it. it is reasonable too.",1
"I bought these and thought they were great. Then I washed them in the dishwasher, they SAY they are dishwasher safe. And now the tops won't close. I contacted the company directly through their website and they never responded. Poor product, poor customer service.",0
This toy seemed very well liked and is recommended on many toy homepages in the Top Ten Toys. I had high hopes but my little boy just doesn't seem interested. We received it early on and I think he liked the sounds of it somewhat. He is now almost 14 months and doesn't really play with it unless he is prompted by  me. Even then he'll only shortly press some buttons and then usually starts picking it up and throwing it. This thing is heavy for a little person and I'm afraid that it could hit his foot or smash through our french doors. I thought it might just take him a little while and that he would be interested as he grows older but so far we could have done without it.,0
"this toy was an instant favorite!anything with a mirror is a hit at our house and this one is top of the list...my favorite feature is that the giraffe's &#34;mane&#34; is a row of loops that the plastic clip hooks into so you can hang it from the car seat canopy or attach it to the stroller so it won't fall out. i LOVE that i can attach the clip to the bottom loop so the giraffe faces right at my baby while it's attached to the canopy! other toys don't work that way and when they're hanging from above, she can only see the bottom of it. with this one, i can hang it so it faces her perfectly and she can see the mirror and pull on the legs, teeth on the wooden ring etc. there's lots to do and feel with this.i also love that once she's older, i can remove the clip altogether and it'll just be a cute stuffed-animal toy for her.this collection of skip hop toys is really cute &#8211;i love that they're gender neutral and modern looking. a total go-to for a cute baby gift!",1
This is a great gate easy to put together and install. Unfortunately I wanted to go one place but the wood was so hard ex had to first drill a hole. Now that is jump is easy to use and the dogs can't get off the porch now.,1
"Baby loves to watch this toy and play in his crib for a short while.  He learned  to touch the starfish to stop and start the music/lights pretty quickly.  He does not go to sleep to it, but that's not really our parenting style.  The volume is loud, even on the low setting.  I am considering putting tape over the speaker to quiet it down.  That is the only reason I give it 4 stars, versus 5.",1
"We have had the velcro (hook and loop) 3.0s for over two years and they still work great.  The 4.0s are another story.  The velcro stays pretty longer, but it stops working completely after a month or two.  We've been warning friends to stay away from the 4.0s,  but told them to look for the 3.0s instead.  When I emailed the company, they suggested that it was how I was laundering them, but since I wash them all the same way and have never had a problem with the others, I know it's not me!  They offered to fix them if I send them in, but what am I supposed to do without my diapers?  No, thank you.  I will be be adding new velcro myself.  Snaps might be an option for some people, but after using both Fuzzi Bunz and Bum Genius diapers with snaps, I have concluded that snaps are even more of a pain.",0
"I was VERY happy with this pump.  I bought it since I was returning to work after 3 months, but ended up needing it on the 3rd day since I had trouble generating enough milk for my hungry daughter.  Because at 2 weeks she then would only drink from the bottle, the pump was my only means of getting healthy breastmilk to her.  I used this pump 3-7 times a day for over 4 months.  I even pumped in the car (as a passenger, of course) using the car adapter.  The adapter cord was long enough that I could easily sit in the backseat next to my daughter, even in a large sedan.  One can also use batteries, although I didn't try them.  I purchased extra bottles, valves, diaphragms and horns.  I only used the extra parts for convenience, to avoid constant dishwashing.  None of the valves actually ever wore out.  Simple to set up: I had to disassemble and wash only 3 pairs of pump parts, aside from the bottles.  As several parts need to be sterilized by boiling before the first use, I would suggest doing so before giving birth, since you won't have the time or the energy when you'll need the pump.  I had also purchased a hand pump for emergencies, but never used it.  The electric pump was small enough and much more efficient that I ended up taking it if I went somewhere.  After getting set up, I could hold both horns with one arm while pumping, and so had one hand free.  It's not particularly loud; any pump will have to make some noise.  It probably won't be heard in an adjacent room.  I put a pillow over it and pumped next to my sleeping daughter every night.  The instructions were quite clear.  Customer service was very helpful the 2 times I called with specific questions and also to replace a damaged carryall.  This Ameda pump was cheaper than the Medela by $100.  I can't think of ANY drawbacks to this pump.",1
I love this! It's much more durable than other bottle racks and fits many of our playtex bottles. Easy to wipe or wash clean. Definitely worth the money and nicer than the junky &#34;tree&#34; bottle rack I had.,1
"I am a big fan of infant playards. Unfortunately, we discovered these wonderful contraptions somewhat late in our first child's development - he was already getting ready to explore very wide areas and small confined spaces were getting irritating to him. However, the multi panel playard that we got managed to serve an alternative purpose of cordoning off some of our more precious possessions - DVD player, stereo, TV, etc.This portable playard is truly a great product. Unlike the multi panel ones it's incredibly easy to assemble - you just put it on the ground and pull the appropriate parts. It likewise assembles back into the collapsed state very easily. It can then be put into the included carrying bag. At 12 pounds it is also very lightweight and easy to carry around.Even though the playard is very light, it is still remarkably sturdy. An infant can safely play inside, bump into its sides, without any worry that it will be damaged or upturned. The manufacturer doesn't recommend putting any blankets or pillows inside, but I don't have any issues with this. The playard is waterproof and can be taken to the beach. It is also easy to clean.As many others have noted, there is an issue with this playard - some of the screws point inward and a child could potentially get hurt by falling on them. However, I don't think this is a very serious danger, but it definitely detracts from the overall design. If you are a DIY type then you can potentially come up with your own hardware hack and add extra protection around the screw areas. Even if you are not too handy with tools, and don't mind ruining the otherwise pleasing look of the playard, you can cover the screws by using several layers of hardy tape.Overall I am well pleased with this product, but it could certainly use a couple of improvements.",1
We love the bedding it really doesn't show it's elegance on the website but we set it up for my new baby and it is beautiful. Definitely suggest it for anyone that wants simplicity and elegance.,1
"I was looking for something to hang on the wall above the changing table when I found this.  From the first moment I layed my baby under it (at 8 weeks) he smiled and """"talked"""" to the lion.  It was like it was a long lost friend.  It's the best reaction he's had to anything yet.  I could not be more thrilled with this!",1

Great quality. Nice and sturdy. We did not have the same problems as other customers related to the smell of the crib. It looks beautiful and is a great addition to our baby's room!,1
There is no way our baby will pull these out because I can barely pull them out. My husband hates them so much he has volunteered to change every outlet in the house to leviton tamper proof so we don't have to use them anymore.,0
"My wife and I purchased this for our nursery.  My wife really likes it and think it is cute, but it is very small.  We knew it was going to be small based on the other reviews and some direct customer responses. It is 5.75"" x 5.75"" and 1.25"" thick.  You cannot hang it on the wall like other reviews say.  It works well on a small nightstand.  I knew this going in, but others may not.  It is also not advertised to be backlit.  This was not important to my wife and I, but this is probably important to others who are trying to look at this in a dimly lit nursery at night.  However, the actual clock portion is very small and this may not even be an issue to many.  We purchased this more as a decorative piece that happens to have a small clock.  We got what we expected.",1
"I purchased the Ergo because my 17 lbs daughter was getting too heavy for the Moby (preferred by me) or the Bjorn (preferred by my husband).  I have a Snugli back carrier, but this made my neck and shoulders ache.  I looked on youtube for some moby backholds and even tried a few but they seemed cumbersome to tie and dangerous to slide the baby into.  I've been stalking the ergo for a while, reading all the horror stories of copycat ergos, watching craigslist and ebay and staring with adoration at the $115.00 Target ones.  Finally, one night the amazon ergo went on sale so I cashed in my visa points with the sale and took advantage of the free shipping and purchased the ergo cheaper than I had found on craigslist.  It shipped quickly and after a bullet point inspection proved I had the real deal, we put it on.  Like the title of this review says, mama and baby love this as a back carrier.  The weight sits on my lower back which makes it comfortable for me and baby sits in the carrier so she isn't giving herself a front wedgie.  I use this for the afternoon witching hour to make dinner and get chores done.  I've gotten brave enough to put this on in the grocery store parking lot and shopping at the mall.  Baby loves throwing her weight side to side and the extra room she has to move.  The adjusts easily and my husband wears her too.  Looking forward to giving this thing a lot of use!",1
"Bassinet was easy to put together after reading the other reviews, quality of bassinet is better than expected. However, after putting it together, I failed to promptly check the electronics on the bassinet. Two weeks before our baby's arrival as I was hand washing (yes, hand washing as none of the material comes off to put in the washer machine) I finally put in the batteries to the night light, music etc and to my surprise none of the electronics work. Will not be returning due to not enough time before our little one arrives. Word to the wise check the electronics as soon as possible. Not too happy that I will not be able to take advantage of these features.",0
"Love these blankets for swaddling... they are the best, especially for ""super swaddle"" as mentioned by another reviewer. However, I have 3 of them and after 4-5 uses, one of them now has a tear along the seam of the blanket and it is unraveling. I'm pretty upset because my baby sleeps MUCH better when swaddled in these blankets and now I have to do laundry every 2 days to keep them fresh.Update ---I have been using these blankets for 5-6 weeks now and all 3 of my blankets have torn along the edges! I imagine this flaw could pose a strangling hazard with continued use.  I am very disappointed in the quality of this product.",0
Graco Ultra Clear Dual Parent MonitorThis is a perfect baby monitor for grandparents to have to monitor little grandkids when they stay away from home. No more sneaking up the stairs to see if the little ones are safe in their beds. You can hear every sound they make and know they are sleeping away.,1
"Like many new first time moms, I registered for many different bottles.  The only brand worth keeping was Dr. Browns.  Our son was born 18 days early and his digestive system was still premature. The Dr. Browns bottles helped tremendously in feeding him.  His reflux was decreased and he did not scream from horrible gas pains.  The system is definitely the best one out there.  I started with Avent and about half of the formula would spill down my son's chin. I was so surprise at how much my son did not like these bottles since so many of my friends loved them.  So if you are registering for bottles ONLY register for Dr. Browns.",1
"I bought this to fit my wife's bike .. As pers the online instructions, it should have worked as the bike has the right frame size, wheel frame and tube diameter.  However, nowhere was it mentioned that you need at-least 6 inches below the seat post.  Frustrating to go through the process and realize that it wouldn't work.  Bought it from Amazon and its going right back!",0
"I LOVE this bag! I wasn't sure when I bought it if it would hold all i needed...but it does! I can fit a wipes case, 3 sz 5 diapers and the large changing pad it comea with. Its great to be able to grab this and go!",1
I wish I had a bedding set for my bed that has a fitted bottom top sheet for my bed!! It is perfect for a toddlers bed!!! I LOVE THIS SET!,1
My daughter wanted to order this with her birthday amazon gift card and she loves it. It's so cute and very soft. The only downside is if you have it on a hard wood surface (or any hard surface) there is potential to slip. She is old enough to know to be careful but I would worry if she was younger about slipping.,1
"It will take a cool mind to install this gate, but once you do it's wonderful. We have had ours in use for almost 2 years and it still works perfect. Ours is located at the top of the stairs so it gets a ton of use. My 5 year old can open it with little effort. My baby climbs on the bottom rail and it has held up. I'm very happy, worth every penny!",1
"This is ideal for the stroller. Also, they are ideal for just about anything along the same idea, such as walkers.",1
"My kindergartener loves his cups: fun, colorful, slender and no spills inside of his lunch kit:))!!!We highly recommend these cups.",1
"My daughter loves her """"Gerber Nuk Graduates Ultimate Soft Spout Cup for Toddlers - 7 Oz - Girls"""". She loves the handles and the soft spout much more than the nuby sippy cups that were given to us at my baby shower...I love the cute designs!!",1
I ordered this carseat has a birthday present for my one year grandson.  My daughter in law did the research and this one seems to be the best on the market.,1
"The Zoli Bot Straw Sippy Cup could be wonderful if it didn't leak so terribly. I love the handles, the weighted straw (so baby can drink in any position), and that it was not hard for my baby to figure out how to drink from it. However, even with the lid being closed properly, etc.... it leaks like crazy! It leaks if it's dropped on the floor and it leaks for just no reason at all. After numerous weeks of dealing with milk, water, and juice puddles everywhere, I have decided to abandon the Zoli bot for a better sippy cup. I've heard that the Dr. Brown Soft Spout Training Cup is excellent and never leaks - that's what we'll be trying next.",0
Works perfectly.  Ordered on here and it was much cheaper than purchasing from Britax.  Recommend this to anyone needing an extra base.,1
"This border is 8"" by 15'.  It is so cute and really brings a room to life.  We used this border with green paint and makes the room just glow, which makes mom glow.  All the peices in this collection go together so well with out becoming over done.  It is VERY pricey but decidedly worth every cent.",1
"Love these little tiles. I purchased the numbers, letters and the animal shapes. Some are formed into cubes, while most pad the floor under her play-pen. They are so bright and wonderful. Great chew toys for my little one, yet offer a safe place for little noggins to land. Would recommend to a friend.",1
These hooks are real sturdy and can take good amount of weight.  I would definitely buy again.  Very nice product plus the Velcro makes it easy to fit on any stroller.,1
"This bassinet is perfect. It's not too giant, but it's way big for a newborn. Not too hard to move around. Others had said the mattress that came with it was too thin, so I ordered a 2 inch mattress. The one inch mattress is fine, I think. It's soft enough. So, I wouldn't have ordered the mattress if I had waited to get the bassinet first. It's great to keep cats away from baby and take outside, so bugs won't &#34;bug&#34; baby either. Love it!",1
Bought this to go with our Inglesina Table Chair. Fits over the arms perfectly and makes clean up a bit easier. We just detach the tray and spray it off in the sink and let it dry. It also helps limit the mess that gets stuck under the chair arms. Love it! We were also happy that we were able to fit it in the chair bag when on the go.,1
I am extremely pleased with this purchase. It was easy to put together although i ended up needing a power drill for the screws. it came out beautiful. The nature sounds are always my favorite option when putting baby to sleep. The big mirror on the mobile as well as the detachable plush birds make for great entertainment and fun. It changes position easily and operates quietly. The best part is no batteries needed! I just plug it in and turn it on. Its nice to have the plug in option because you never have to worry about batteries dying! I love this swing and I am glad I bought it for baby.,1
"Best soothing sounds on the market, the sounds are waves, rain, classical music and heartbeat.There is a sleep timer and a mp3 in plug",1
"My 6 month old baby girl loves this!!!! She got it from here great grandma for a gift and loves being in it she feel part of the group. I love that it adjust to three different levels (she's small) and has a jumper setting so she can bounce. She's already learned to scoot backwards in it. And, she looks so cute in here pink GT.",1
Good night light and very nice looking.  Matches perfectly the other sports theme items in the room.  A bit pricey but has worked out well for us.,1
"We did so much research and this seat passed all the tests.  It's comfy and easy to use.The reason we had to return it was the short crotch strap.  My daughter is 2 1/2 and in the 50% for weight (95% for height) and the center buckle dug into her legs.  It was just too short.  She is tall and thin!  When I called customer service, they said that have had ""tons"" of complaints about this, but there was ""nothing they could do.""  She said they were ""aware of the problem"" but overall was quite rude about the entire situation.  I would not buy this seat unless your child has VERY skinny thighs.",0
"I should give this less stars because the markup on these things is totally obscene, BUT they are exactly what I needed.  Arrived quickly, very clean and well packaged.",1
"I ordered 3 sets (9 pieces all) in March 2011 when I was pregnant with my second son. I am living outside US and the price in my country is double so I decided to order in Amazon and have them delivered to my sister in the US then she brought them to me on her vacation in my country. I was shocked when I checked the items! The neck of the bottles are all irregularly-shaped, either oval or have dents. Maybe they're the bottles that failed the quality standards. I tried testing all of them by putting water. Before I could close them, I had to squeeze the neck so the lid can fit. Turned each up side down, and as expected, they leaked. So I had to make last minute shopping before giving birth in August. Unfortunately, I can never return the items.",0
Very very very nice toy. I presented it for my friend's daughter. she loves it. Good toy for such price,1
"My son loves his aden and anais pinzon blankets.  I had received a single aden and anais blanket from a friend and used it to swaddle my son at night. I don't swaddle him anymore, but I wanted another one for the stroller or car seat. They are great to use for a nursing cover as well.  My son is 5 mo. old and he loves to scrunch up the blanket and put it to his cheek.  It is so sweet!  I think it is worth the price tag- you get four blankets!  I paid less then $10 a piece for them which I don't think is so crazy.  They are perfect for a newborn who likes to be swaddled.",1
"I bought this for our Graco glider.  It does fit easily, yet securely.  I like the bright, attractive toys, and the adjustability.  I can't say how engaging it is yet for the baby.  I think that at 2 months, she's still too young to really get into these yet.",1
"I wanted to love this bag.  I loved the simplicity of the design and the size looked perfect from the dimensions given online.  I have been searching for a messenger style diaper bag but this one didn't work for me and I'm sharing so maybe it can help someone else who is also in the hunt for the perfect diaper bag.- The strap is cloth and is always getting tangled up and twisted.  For such an expensive bag I would expect a nicer strap, but it is just a simple piece of canvas and also the color is deceiving in the Amazon picture.  It looks like a creamy white, but it is actually a very light pink, which to me looks like you washed the bag and the red part bled onto it.- The interior is lined with a very stiff, thick vinyl.  It is nice b/c you can wipe it out easily and it is white so you can see things, but it gets dirty very easily, shows everything and I already have several scuff marks that won't come off.  Also the majority of your bag is taken up by the two cup holders which are on the inside and once you put two bottles, or a sippy cup/bottle in them half your bag is gone.  There was barely room for the changing pad, diapers, and wipes.  There are three small pockets along the inside, but they are seriously big enough for my small garage opener and they are so narrow and deep that once you put something in there it is seriously wedged in there. There is a divider in this bag and if you put anything in the one side then it really bulks the bag out because you are using space from the other side and because of the fabric and lining there is no give.  As for other pockets, there is a cell phone pocket which is nice and in a convenient spot, and then a ""paperback"" pocket.  The paperback pocket is too small for a paperback, but it did fit my wallet and maybe over time it would stretch out to fit a book.Once the pockets are filled, or really even half of the pockets are filled, the bag gets very bulky and the flap will not close all the way.As you can tell I was frustrated by this bag.  I wanted to like this bag and it had 5 star reviews from everyone who used it.  I was surprised no one had noted any of the things I noticed and so I hope my review helps you.  I still gave it to two stars b/c I really like the design, it had a nice key clip, and it could work as a purse for someone.",0
"Any toy should be judged by 1) how safe it is, 2) how desirable it is for babies, and 3) how desirable it is for parents.  This toy meets all those requirements.  This is a high-quality, safe toy, with many different colors and textures.  Depending on her mood, my baby likes to play with a specific animal, but there is always one that suits her fancy.  The elephant's trunk is especially great for chewing. They're small enough to fit in the diaper bag and are easily gripped by small hands.  As for care, these wash well.  I can't say anything bad about this item.",1
"I bought these bowls because I really do hate when my son throws his dishes on the floor before he is even done eating. They do just what they say... keep the bowl on the tray! I know some people have stated that they do not stay on for their children, but they are sticking perfectly for mine, yet are easy for me to remove. They also stay to the table top and counters. It may be that some trays are not as flat or might be damaged from wear and tear. The bowl did not stick well to my cutting board. It even stuck to the side of my fridge overnight. Anyhow, they are made from a durable plastic that washes up super easy and the lids are nice too. Mostly I find that my son likes playing with the lids while I feed him. I love the colors and design. The handles have a silicone coating (like those floppy pans you can bake in, or like oven mitts) so you can get a nice grip.The covers have texture and designs. All in all a great purchase and one I am very pleased with. Will definitely buy more of these.",1
"My daughter likes the balls, but gets board easily with this toy. It needs sounds, or something else for more entertainment.",0
"Even at maximum volume, the sound on the monitor is so low that I have to be sitting right next to it to hear it, and it doesn't always pick up the sound all the way.  I would not purchase this again or recommend it.  The picture quality is good, and the night vision setting is decent, but I need to hear my daughter as much, if not more so, than I need to see her.",0
"It's work good. Good for traveling, I even use it ad night in my house. the best product for cleanse.",1
"everything is allright, we love it.works perfect, it is very useful.i do recomend this product to future parents",1
The perfect gift for our new great granddaughter.  It will be nice to take when she begins her swimming lessons.,1
"We really wanted Mamaroo to work for our fussy baby.  Our LO is a cat napper and would not be happy unless she is held and rock most of the time.  We purchased Mamaroo from a local baby store with 20% coupon (couldn't wait for amazon delivery)  and had it when our LO was 4-10 weeks old.The design is really great, I love it.  The music/sound function features means you can skip Sleep sheep or other soothing sound device and the ability to plug in any MP3 (not just iPOD) player is a nice touch.  The entire product is futuristic, well thought out and has quality all over it.  Its also small enough footprint (compare of the traditional swing) if space is an issue.However, all these great feature is useless if it doesn't soothe our baby!!  its too slow to soothe our LO.  If she is asleep and we put her in there, she would be fine.  Then again, I've tried this not using any of its motion, it worked the same.  If she is fussy or colicky, she will continue to do so in the swing.  Our manual efforts that work well are: strolling around the house with car seat stroller or rocking on a yoga ball.  Compare the speed motion, this swing is just too slow for us....Luckily, the return policy in the store was great or if you are amazon mom member, the return policy is equivalent.  We couldn't justify keeping a product that doesn't work at this price.3 stars for the design and quality",0
"This diaper pail liner has no frills but it gets the job done. A large bag with elastic on top that fits into most standard trash cans. It really is waterproof, we have never had a leak. It washes and dries right along with the cloth diapers, and comes out clean and smelling fresh. Mine still looks new after dozens of washes. I have several so that I can always keep a clean liner ready. Comes in great colors, too.",1
"I love this diaper backpack, I used to have an over the shoulder bag but with all the things needed for my son the bag was getting heavy. Plus Im expecting another little one and the backpack is the way to go so I have my hands more free. I was a little concerned about the size of the bag, but I was pleasantly surprised with how much stuff you can pack in this backpack. The bag is confortable around my shoulders.This bag is super organized, there are mommy pockets for keys, wallet, cell phone, sunglasses and then an organized main compartment that I can have a place for diapers/wipes/snacks and zippered areas to keep other items organized. Plus there are a few other small compartments to put little items you need such as hand sanitizers, pens, lipstick. There are two insulated bottle holders that keeps my sons water and milk more chilled. This bag is also machine washable which is nice when you have kids. There is a side compartment as well for a diaper changing pad. I LOVE this bag because I always know where things are instead of having to dig through a huge bag!I have received many compliments on this bag, the pattern is fun as well! JuJu Be really pays attention to the details and functionality for busy moms.",1
As other reviewers have said before make sure that the electrical outlets in your home have one screw instead of two. All of ours that I have found so far only have one so we have most of the outlets in the bulk package. Yes these type of outlets are more expensive than the outlet plugs but they work much better and you don't have to constantly be picking up and putting back in outlet plugs. The only thing I don't like about these outlet covers is that they seem slightly smaller than the standard size cover so if the old outlet had been there a while the paint might look a little worn and this new outlet won't completely cover up the same area your old outlet did. Other than that we are very happy with this purchase.,1
"What can I say?  After hauling around and hassling with big, bulky car seats for almost six years, using this car seat is a breeze!  What's not to like?!  We tend to use this seat on shorter trips when our daughter won't be falling asleep.  We also have a booster with a back, that's the one was use for longer road trips.",1
The bottles in the picture are different than the one has been sent to me .. the ml numbers is not the same as shown in the picture !!! At the end you sent me wrong order!!!,0
"This gate is nice and very sturdy.  The only problem we have with it is that the button you push to keep it open doesn't work very well after 5 months of use.  If you would like a gate that stays open easily, the KidCo Frieplace Gate stays open with no button to push when it is at a 90 degree angle.",1
These are fine if you clean one bottle a day. They just can't hold up to regular use. The nipple brush is OK - but it goes pretty quick too. The bottle brush just simply wouldn't get the bottles clean. Spend the money on a munchkin bottle brush ....,0
"As with most safety related baby merchandise, we purchased our Primo Viaggio based on its excellent review in Consumer Reports.  My guess is that the folks at CR never tested the seat with an actual baby in it.  Our 3 month old cried constantly whenever we put him in this seat.  Normally he is a very happy, mellow kid.  He is always smiling and happy. But as soon as we put him in this seat, he begins to fuss and by the time we are pulling out of the driveway he is in full wail.  For the first couple of months, we didn't even think to attribute it to the car seat.  My wife would even put off or completely avoid trips in the car because she felt so bad about how uncomfortable he felt.  We happened to have an extra, unused, Graco car seat laying around and one day we decided to give it a try to see if it made any difference.  WOW!!!.  It was like night and day.  We put him in that seat and he smiled away. I should also mention that the Graco seems to weigh about half as much as the Primo.  Now car trips are filled with the pleasant sounds of his happy burbles instead of the anguished cries we heard while he was in the Peg Perego.",0
"This system did a good job until apparently the support ring for the second level deformed and it started to fall, pretty much making the system unusable.  It is a good, large drying system if you can prevent your's from doing this.",0
"This caddy is handy, with enough space for all diaper changing necessaries. A bit heavier than many alternatives I'd looked at, I believe this is due to its solid construction. The little drawer doesn't slide very easily, but perhaps that will improve with use.",1
"Great wheels and nicely designed.  We have had about six or seven of these types of units, either as gifts or as hand-me-downs.  They were either flimsy or very, very loud on hardwood floors.  This unit is nearly perfect.  Quiet, smooth wheels, easy turning and quality components.  It also shows up assembled!",1
"Works as advertised. Had no issues fitting on the new outlet with the provided screws, and the outlet cover has a clean look.",1
"We have been using 2 of these bags for 2 months now and had no issues whatsover. The fabric feels great and my son sleeps great in it. We have previously tried Halo and Grobags and although Grobags had some neat features (side zipper, shoulder snaps) that I wish A&A had, these are a clear winner with us. We had no issues with quality as some of the reviewers here seem to have, about the only downside is that it never dries enough in the dryer when dried with other clothes. One thing to be aware of is that these bags are supposed to be long for the same reason Grobag makes long sleep sacks - to allow babies to move, crawl and to a degree walk in them. That might not work for a newborn that feels better swaddled, but my fifteen month old definitely appreciates it. If you prefer a tighter fit, go a size smaller.",1
They are convenient for the diaper bag.  Easy to wash and very water proof.  Nice value for the money I spent.,1
I would recommend this to breastfeeding moms who have to go back to work and have a baby that has never used a bottle before. I tried four different bottles and this is the only one he will use thanks mimijumi!,1
This thing is so cute and works just like it's advertised.  My daughter uses it as a flashlight to read her books in bed. She loves it.,1
"We haven't had any problems with this seat since we got it. Our son fits in it perfectly, and he loves the cupholder because he likes to stash snacks in there for later. It easily latched to our backseat in our van, and it feels a lot more secure than the booster seat we had bought for our eldest child.",1
"These bottles are not worth the money.  I have been using them for about five months and they have always leaked a little bit.  Now they leak constantly every time I go to feed the baby.  You would be better off with something else, the Plaxtex Vent Aire works great.",0
"Spend a little more and get a better one or simply stick with an audio only monitor, as that is basically what you are getting with this one. There is no night vision, I could not even make out a blob for my daughters bed, The audio was acceptable but not great. We were gifted a Samsung monitor for our son and it is flawless. I went in search of a monitor for our daughter, who is 6, after we moved into a home where our bedrooms are 2 floors apart. It offered her a little more security. We ended up with the levana for her and while it does not compare to the samsung, it gets the job done for $80 less. The Infant Optics needs massive improvements.",0
"Easy to use, no complaint from the grandkids will be able  to convert as he gets bigger.  Was  recommended by our daughter",1
Absolutely love this. Very bright light reaches ceiling. Very beautiful and relaxing. Would recommend this product it has my full support,1
"I had the same squeamish feelings when reading the description of the product, but it truly works! I had been using the Graco Nasal Aspirator till now, and poor thing died after a year of pretty much daily use (we live in a very dry place... lots of gunk in the baby's nose). I was planning on ordering the same again, but bought this instead after seeing the good reviews. The reviews are true! This thing truly works. It has a broad tip that fits just right in the nostril and because you can adjust the suction, you can get a lot of gunk out quickly. Always a plus with a wiggly baby. I had been meaning to buy the tweezers but they come free with this, so it was a nice bonus. I have used those a couple of times to get the crusty stuff that just out of the reach of a tissue. Highly recommended!",1
"Everything that others report here about it not working is our experience at well. It worked for perhaps 5 minutes, and then we couldn't get the thing to stay on. I'm not sure if the button stayed in the on position and drained the battery - but the second time we tried to use it, it didn't work at all. It was really cool when it did work, so it's a shame the mechanical quality of product is so poor.",0
I just wanted to say I received this set at a shower and have absolutly loved using it.  I have found that my son has less gas and took to these bottles quite easily after brestfeeding.  My sister recommended them to me and I want to recommend them to you.  They are great! And what's even better is that there are no daily consumables.,1
"These bibs are super soft and absorbent. They provide great coverage. I like that they use snaps instead of velcro. The snaps on one of my bibs broke, so I contacted the company and they sent me a replacement bib. Great customer service!",1
"Very nice table for the price.  The only downside was putting the table together.  It took me 2 days, a few hours each day.  Need to be honest, I did have the assistance of a 3  year-old.  In total, it took me about 4 hours to put it together, but I did take my time and follow the directions.  Directions were very good btw, but it is a time consuming venture.  If you have an opportunity to purchase this unit assembled, I would strongly advise.  I would have paid $50-75 to have it assembled.  Overall, nice purchase, sturdy and for the money, I am happy with it.... It's furniture I only need for 1-2 years before I donate it or give it away.",1
"The picture seems to suggest that the item is like a rug.  Upon receipt, its hardly anything more than a giant applique.  It is very thin, could not be used as a rug.  I've used mine as a chair cover.  Its cute, but if you're looking for a Hello Kitty rug, this is not it.  But it was a decent price, so I'm not that disappointed.  It would be nice as a wall hanging.",0
I was very excited about the bright colors---my daughter loved the fact it could be dolded up very easy.  We all love the safety features knowing Lucy is safe when belted it.  Very happy with the high chair!!,1
"This wrap was perfect for my two month old.  We have tried other carriers that have a lot of fabric and they get too hot in our Midwest summer.  The woven fabric is light and airy and the tail works great as a nursing cover.  It does, however, hurt my back if we wear it for too long.  Be sure to switch what side you wear it on every time you wear it.",1
These are the best brand beginner sippy cup....The bottles and sippy cups have interchangeable lids so if u have a bottle and nipple...all u have to do is get the silicone spout to go in the sippy cup...I was a breast feeding mom for a year and went Thur a lot of sippy cups before settling on the nuks...my baby which is now 15 months love them...they even make hard spouts for the baby that chews on soft nipple tops...,1
These are great for the tub! They keep my toddler occupied during her bath time. They stick to the side of the tub with no problem. Great for number and letter recognition and fun! They're easy to scoop up (we have a tub toy net). Love these!,1
It is a very cute pacifier holder. Only drawback is it is a little too long. Wouldn't leave it attached to baby's clothing unattended. Could easily get wrapped around baby's neck.,0
"My Granddaughter loves it. Unfortunately this product is sold at Walmart for a lot less. Hate to give that store my business, but will look there first from now on.",1
"This was a shower gift for our daughter.  She and our granddaughter loved it...for 3 months, that is; then it just stopped working.  I would have given it five stars if it had operated for a reasonable amount of time, at least long enough for a couple of babies to use it.",0
"This is a great shopping cart cover! The cost is a little more than other covers but is definately worth the extra money. It covers every part of the cart your baby can touch. I am even able to use it over restaurant high chairs (not a perfect fit - but covers everything). There are little loops to hook toys into in the front and inside side pockets to stash snacks or whatever (I hide my wallet in there while shopping sometimes). It is a bit large when folded (to big to fit in diaper bag if you have more than a few diapers in it), but that is due to the nice soft and durable fabric. It comes in a plastic carrying case with a handle (I'm guessing it's about 12""x8"" and about 2""thick - I leave mine in the car). I just wish I would have found this sooner - my daughter loves it too. Would be a great gift for a baby shower.",1
"These stickers are adorable. Sticky enough to stay, but come off easily. Colors are great, size is perfect. Wouldn't change a thing!",1
"I am very happy with this piggy bank.  I was looking for traditional style, like the one I had as a little girl & this is it but bigger.  It's large, similar to the size of a standard soccer ball, made of smooth ceramic & has a nice gloss.  My package arrived in perfect condition with no chips on the paint.  The color is very pretty, it has a white plug to take money out from the bottom.  A detail I really like is that the feet are padded (white) so that it doesn't skid or scratch furniture.",1
"I use these bottles to send expressed milk into daycare for my son.  I had looked at some of the other brands for glass bottles (we had been previous Dr. Browns users) but the pricing was prohibitive.  My son doesn't seem to have any issues with excess air consumption using these bottles and they're priced so much better!  I love the silicone wraps - although I'd suggest taking them off for washing.  Once you get used to putting them on and off they're not a hassle.  We've also dropped these bottles a couple times while washing, and none have broken - so a thick borosilicate glass bottle apparently is real tough!",1
This product is horrible.  I do not suggest anyone ordering it.  The pump does not work well at all.  I only wish I could return it to get my money back...I don't want anyone to waste their money on a P.O.S..only wish I could give this product zero stars!!!,0
"Being pregnant, I can sleep much better at night with this pillow! Haven't tried it as a nursing pillow yet. Baby is on the way! :-)",1
It was dead on arrival.  So maybe not the batteries fault...but just beware.  Sucks to have to return it and wait.,0
"We love using FuzziBunz!  It is a bit more of an investment than one size diapers in other brands, but I feel it is more than worth it.  As my son is growing older, the other one size diapers were fitting too small and wouldn't hold as many inserts.  We love the Perfect Fit Fuzzi Bunz and have them in all sizes.  Whenever there have been any issues with leaking, it has been due to our closure of the diapers, or my son needing more inserts to absorb more.  We use the microfiber insert (which was enough when he was an infant) along with 1-2 hemp inserts in order to avoid leakage.",1
We put this up last night and We were surprised by the number of toys it holds ! Looks great and is functional!,1
"so easy to relax when you infant son is contented.  this little fisher price seat does the trick, no joke.  he loves thelittle hanging toys and the vibration function is great to put him at ease when he gets cranky.  well built and sturdy.  must have for new parents",1
"I bought two of these and feel as though they are a must have if you use Similac bottles!  The lid snaps tight and stays shut, unlike other formula containers that I have bought.  It makes formula feeding on the go so easy!",1
"That's all it was.  Tiny litle seeds in a tiny little baggie.  If they grow, great..... but I will have to wait and see if they do.",0
"These are by far my favorite dishes for my Twins to eat out of and we have a lot of different bowls.My girls are able to grab more food out of these than any of their other dishes, this is due to the sloped & smooth insides.This does not slide all over their high chair tray, it stays right where I put it.It does not tip as many of their other bowls do.These are easy to clean & I hand wash them. I just un-snap the 2 pieces wash them and snap them back together when they are dry. This is VERY easy but a child would not be able to do it.These also fit together so they take up less space!!These are a little pricy but I figured since it was something we would be using EVERYDAY, several times a day, it was worth getting something that worked great and would not wear out.Several people have complained that their child is able to pick these up & throw them and are dissapointed. Ummmmm, DUH!! If your child is able to pick things up and throw them since this is not glued down, held by some magnetic force, etc. then yes, they will be able to pick it up. That is just common sense. These are just harder to pick up. Try teaching your child some manners, yes, even at 1 year old children can be taught not to do something. If you are having trouble with your child throwing their plate then perhaps you should be looking for a book on teaching your child some manners instead of trying to fix the problem with a bowl!",1
Have been using for the last couple months & it is great.  Would definitely recommend to any parent that wants peace of mind during the night.,1
The plastic is poor with bad smell. It's not healthy for baby as she wants to eat them when getting them.,0
got this for my 1 month old grandson he is curious about everything (like curious george)but i thought it was adorable especially when he kicks his feet the feet make sounds,1
"It's a nice rattle, but you can get it at lower price. I just found out that it's only about $3 at my local Kroger.",1
Great alternative to the overpriced Bjorn sheet. I was glad to put that saved money towards the Bjorn bassinet instead.,1
"We wanted something sturdy, functional, safe yet not bling bling.  We got just that!  We love this highchair.  I have been a nanny for 15 years and have seen 100's of chairs that have all the bells and whistles and then break.  This one is time tested and mommy approved.  It is a simple and chic chair that even looks great in our kitchen.  As for getting dirty....of course it does what do you expect when putting a baby in there to eat??  IMO I think it is very easy to clean with a damp cloth nothing rigorous  needed, just a simple wipe down and our baby loves it too!",1
"These are a little to big for me (even thought I have big-uns).  They tend to get wrinkles in them and you can see them through a shirt, an under shirt, and a bra all at once.  Not my favorite.  They are, however very absorbant.",0
"This is a very nice looking and easy to operate gate.  You do need to screw the gate into the wall to have it well secured.  We purchased this extra tall version hoping that my toddler would not be able to climb over it (he climbs everything), we had the regular height version, unfortunately he started climbing the extra tall version in a few weeks.  Would work great for pets or toddlers that don't climb everything.",1
"Love, love, love this stroller! Received it sooner than I thought I would, and it was very easy to put together. My husband and I had it together in 10-15 minutes. Very stable, smooth, & light weight! Love that it came with the car-seat & base. Great deal for your money and well worth the buy. Would highly recommend this product to others!",1
Just what I expected. Now my grand daughter can sit at the table without sliding all over the chair seat.,1
My son doesnt love it. Even when frozen he pays it no attention. Its easy for his little hands to hold.,0
"This is a pretty awesome little stroller. LOve the canopy for two reasons, when you arent using it as a canopy you can use it to hold stuff. Also cute Mickey logo and it shipped rather quickly.",1
"If you are looking for a full-size double stroller seat, this is not the stroller/seat for you. However, the Rumble Seat is a great seat for your toddler who doesn't plan on being in the stroller for extended periods of time. The seat attaches in a matter of seconds and does not take up a lot of extra space in the trunk. I have found that if you face the main seat away from you (facing out) and then attach this seat, the toddler has a better view and the ride is a little more enjoyable. It would be great if the seat could recline a little bit, in case your toddler doses off while you walk, but all in all I would recommend this seat, especially because it really does not effect the way the stroller maneuvers.",1
Got these burp clothes in addition to the towel and wash clothes. They are high quality - good absorbancy - and we've washed them several times and they have held up very well. Very cute. Also more than enough to clean up spit-ups.,1
This toy was given to my son last christmas by my aunt. He loves this toy for all the different music it plays.  This is his favorite toy with the different sounds and lights...,1
"My 2 month old baby loves this sling. If he's fussy or I need my hands free, he loves to be in it and usually falls asleep. It is very comfortable to wear and really frees me up to use my hands. I didn't have any of the trouble reported by another reviewer that it didn't fit a smaller person. I'm 5'4&quot; and the product fit great once I tightened down the strap. This is great for shopping, walking or just around the house.",1
So darn cute !!!!!,1
"These are adorable, but once you wash them a few times, the quality of the fabric didn't stand up to what I was expecting.",0
They are the perfect large size for my 10 month old! Great price and lovely product.,1
"There are no cons for this.  The boppy can be used as an newborn holder, to prop up your infant when sitting, as a nursing pillow, as an adult pillow etc.  My son is 8 months now and we just leave it on the playroom floor to either cushion him when he throws himself backwards, to support him when he sits, to support me if I lay next to him etc.  I also love this when we fly, we traveled when he was 5 months and 7 months and both times I used it while nursing on take off and landing.  I would recommend this to all parents and pillow lovers. Specifically this slipcover is very pretty, gender nuetral and the fabric is soft and comfy",1
Just what we needed for our maltese puppy!  We did fill in the gaps with wood pieces to make it look like a fence. :-). Perfect. Fills our laundry room doorway.,1
"My opening is 46 1/2"" so the 48 is to big and the 42 is to small.  To solve the problem I used 1 2x4 on one side and 1 1x4 on the other side.  Using the extra boards also gave me a place to secure the know cups which keeps the knobs from walking if a dog jumps on it, without having the cups screwed into the wall.The only reason I only gave 4 out of 5 stars is the fact that the description did not let me know there could be a problem with sizes inbetween 36 and 48,  It may be workable for most sizes but not the 46 1/2'.Overall the quality is awesome, ease of opening is also great.  I will try to find a 4"" extension or even cut the 6"" down slightly and if it doesn't present any issues fitting back with the gate panel, I will trim the 12"" as well and it will make the gate fit better.Easy to put together and install.",1
"I registered for this necklace because of the great reviews and authenticity guarantee on this item's page. Unfortunately, after getting the item and being suspect about its materials I brought it to my local natural baby boutique and asked the clerk who sells amber necklaces all day long to take a look - it was easy to see and feel in comparison side by side that this necklace is a total fake  - probably made of plastic. I am so disappointed!",0
"we're currently using the seat in its rear facing position.  it seems comfortable for our almost one year old, and it's easy to get her in and out.  my almost 3 year old can fit it in too.  it's a good seat, especially for the price.",1
Its getting harder and harder to find these sponges but they are the best. My baby loves it. Only problem is that it collects hair and dust like no other.,1
"Very cute hamper and a decent size. However, it didn't last very long. The plastic sticks that hold it's shape slowly pushed through the fabric and came out. Still use hamper, but doesn't hold shape now without clothes in it. It probably lasted about 6 months or so.",0
"I love these! I've bought one for myself and 2 for gifts. They are a great size and perfect for swaddling, nursing cover, and blanket to cover car seat or stroller during the summer months! I definitely recommend!",1
"This is just a little baby chew toy but like my daughter-in-law says, &#34;Every baby deserves an overpriced, French chew toy!) She should know-she has purchased several and the kids always seem to love them.",1
"So far all I have used them for is freezing breast milk. I haven't defrosted any of the tubes to use yet.  It seems to be quite a money saver since we don't have to buy the bags anymore; however, it isn't as fast and convenient as the bags. I think I will like the ability to choose how many ounces to defrost with each bottle.",1
"Worth every penny! Easy to assemble, only issue is the loud music it doesn't have an off switch but you can always just take out the batteries.",1
Monitor video went out so all I have is sound on it. Plus the alarm sensors go off every 5 seconds. If I put on silent it still vibrates and it is incredibly annoying. It is a great idea that was POORLY executed! I would probably buy the Motorola monitor after. Kudos to Amazon for an easy return!,0
"Very useful product.  Seems safe and BPA-free.  Only drawback is the dishwasher: you can straddle 2 prongs (surrounding the lid and container) on the top rack, but you still need to lean something heavy on top; otherwise, it's so light it'll flip over.",1
"I returned this product. I did not realize it would only last for sizes up to 5.  My daughter got her first pair of shoes at size 4.5.  This would've lasted me only a couple of months.Otherwise, it's a great idea and it looks and feels like it is made well.",0
I don't remember the original cover being so itchy.  Also this is not soft at all.  I'm going to try to wash it a few times with fabric softener to see if that helps.  Also very difficult to get this on and off the pillow,0
This is a very nice back pack. Wish there was a good place to hide/tuck away the strap when not in use and bag was just a little bigger for regular water bottle but all in all it is very nice. Holds 5 disposable diapers 1 small package of wipes and one change of clothes for a 1 1/2 year old. Don't think I can fit anything else in it after that.,1
My granddaughter uses it just fine - she even emptys it into the &#34;big potty&#34; all by herself.  Great value!,1
"I got to be about 20 weeks pregnant and got this pillow - it was probably the BEST decision ever. Especially since I was a tummy sleeping pre-pregnancy, not only did the pillow help make me sleep on my sides, but it helped make sleep comfortable for the remainder on my pregnancy. My daughter is 16 months old and I still use this pillow... LOL",1
The double-sided tape was not enough to keep it attached to the edges of our raised tile foyer.  Abandoned it's use within 2 weeks.,0
"I was very hesitant buying this but now am so glad I did. I bought this months ago and having been using it daily I will definitely recommend it my boys loved it, it doesn't move around,the kneel pad was a great addition. Very easy to wash and the quality is great no complaint.",1
"I bought these bottles after reading reviews on them and have been pretty happy with them. They have never leaked with me BUT I have never screwed the lid on too tightly. You HAVE to remember that. When you overtighten the lid, the nipple gets distorted and the seal is broken. My husband and others in the family have had this problem. It is probably always helpful to test for leaks (when you test the temp of the milk) BEFORE you give it to the baby, just to make sure.I like the plastic they use. It has always felt extremely sturdy. They are easily to hold (thanks to the curve) and I really like the wide mouth of the bottles which make them easy to clean....and you are pretty sure they are clean!!I bought the newborn starter set and the infant set and together they are all I require for bottles and a breastmilk storage set!! I really like dthat you get the brush, pacifier and two sizes of bottle in the newborn set. Made my life easy.All in all I think they were a great buy and worth it. I would use them all over again and would use avent with my next baby too.",1
"Graco Pack 'n Play Playard in Bugs QuiltI had been shopping for Play Pens for sometime and nothing seem that appealing until I found this one. The extra size and the bright colors just did it for me. But what makes it even better is the ease with which you can put it up and take it  down. But the best part of all is how much my granddaughter enjoys this playard. She is fascinated with all of it. She enjoys playing with the different bugs (that make sounds when touched) which are on the inside as well as outside. She also loves to make faces in the mirror on the inside as well as just gaze at the bottom designs. I thought she wouldn't like being put in the playard but she fooled me as she seems to really enjoy her time in it.The bottom quilt has very pretty interesting designs. Children love the primary colors much more than the pastels that so many playards come in, and the designs of this playard are quite appealing to toddlers to view and play with.This playard is a real winner!",1
"Considering the price, I was extremely disappointed with these chairs.  It looks like they have had putty put where the spindles meet the seat.  It chips off and looks terrible!",0
"As a new mom who will only nurse for a couple months, I didn't want to purchase an expensive electric pump. I opted for this and couldn't be happier. It's very easy to use (expressed 4 ozs on my very first try), washes well and I plan to use it until my son is about 3 montbs old. In addition, I use it 2-3 times a day and it's held up well. I have no complaints and reccomend this product for moms that are looking for a short term breast pump. I can see that long term use can start to wear on your wrists.",1
"I absolutely ADORE this baby carrier. I love the way this baby carrier fits so easily in my baby bag, and I love the fact that there are several ways to carry baby in it. I have been using this non-stop. It really helps to put my 3 month old to sleep in a jiffy. Everywhere I go with her in it people stop and say ""your baby looks so comfortable in there."" She loves it, and it makes it so easy for me to go on all my errands with her tagging along. It is really easy to figure out the different ways to carry baby in this. I wish I had bought this much much earlier. This is a must for all mothers on the go!",1
Love that these wipes are free and clear and they don't irritate sensitive baby skin however the scent of them is a little off-putting and they are thin so it takes 3 or more to take care of &#34;big jobs&#34;.,0
"which isnt a bad thing, being small.  It seem smuch more practical as far as keeping it with us in a diaper bag on the go or having it on hand rather than it remain stationary in the baby's room.  Does everything it claims too.  No complaints here.",1
"i wish i wouldve reead the description a little closer it was a bit smaller than i expected its a great size though for kids under 5, it also has a little rattle in it which isnt bad it was just unexpected. VERY well made even though it cost me 20 dollars its something i highly believe will hold together and my kids kids kids could someday enjoy it.",1
"so cute, each cup has a little shape punched into the bottom.  my 12 month old loves playing with these.",1
"Good product.  I bought the side and front rail protectors. They are soft and wash well.  I only gave them a four because sometimes they can ""ride up"" unless they are tied really tight.  They fit my crib really well, I have the Graco Lauren.  Better (for me) than the stick on gel strips.",1
"Great diaper bag for everyday use! Comes with everything you would need and holds a lot, even has a changing pad to match the bag!",1
I got it based on reviews and I am glad I did.  My now-7-month-old son likes it though not as much as another musical toy.  The only downside of this toy as far as I can see - which was also pointed out by other reviewers - is that sound is very unnatural - I was surprised even though I was expecting it.  Think of an old cell phone with musical ringer.,1
These are great!  Perfect for baby. Perfect for environment.  So easy to use!  No rashes ever!  Really cute colors and prints.,1
"The first time I received this item, it was clearly previously used before and one of the blue foam blades was half torn-off. I returned it that same day. My replacement fan took a week to arrive even though I had ordered 2-day shipping. The second fan arrived in packaging that was horribly torn up and I couldn't believe that Amazon would re-sell an item is such poor packaging. I inserted the 2 AA batteries and the fan wouldn't turn on right away; I had to jostle the switch to get it to work. Convinced exchanging the item again would be pointless, I kept the 2nd fan which works, minus having to tinker with the switch every now and again to get it to work. I've had the item for only a week now and already have to replace the batteries.On the plus side, the fan does provide a nice breeze - more than I expected - and we attach it to the head of my son's rear-facing convertible car seat so that it blows straight down on his head. It does help since the car seat blocks the back seat air vents.",0
"What can a bottle bag really do to knock your socks off? Probably not much, but it does the job well. I like that it can hold so much stuff in a pretty small bag. I send my sons two tall doc brown bottles, his food pouch, jar of baby food and two cooler packs in it every say to daycare. I've also been able to fit a Sippy cup. I like the top compartment that zips separately for putting small other things in there like papers without them getting wet from the moisture inside. And the pattern is very unique so I always know whose bag it is.",1
This monitor finally died last night after 2.5 years of awful spotty coverage.  Even the windy nights would knock out the monitor making us have to reset it in the middle of the night.,0
"Sturdy, well made, fits in the diaper bag with ease. Good product to have when on the go with your baby.",1
"I got this for my daughter at 7 months. She like it, she enjoys things that light up and make noise. It is a bit heavy though. The peices are heavy and a bit bulky. You child can get hurt with any hard plastic toy while banging it, but this one seems a bit more riskier due to its size. I am not worried about them braking they are made pretty well. I haven't had any problems with the shorting out though like other reviewers have said. This won't be a toy that she is left to play with by herself. I didn't hear about a recall on it, has someone else?",1
"I bought 2 packs of these before baby was born and probably only needed to buy one, but I have never had a problem with leaking so maybe others would disagree.  Good to have on hand and like that the back is waterproof so if you leak a lot, it won't go through to your clothes. Same waterproof material that they use on their cloth diapers that work perfectly too! Great brand, only gave 4 stars because of the high price.",1
"I cannot be more happier with these lovely wall decals, they made my sons little walk in nursery closet beautiful. :) I don't own the home so painting it was out of the option but when I heard about decals, I thought why not give it a try and it looks like someone painted them on. They stick wonderfully and havent fallen off! :) They are just as adroable as a button too!",1
it keeps the baby sitting up by itself.  I used it for my first child and it became a must for our second,1
"My son was still attached to his bottle. I tried many ways and many zippy cups available for him to stop the bottle but nothing seemed to work till I bought this product. It was a very easy transition for him and for me as well since I didnt have to deal with the crying anymore. The shape is very close to the one of his bottle; therefore, he was able to make the transition until he is ready for his next one.",1
"My 3 year old received the sea turtle for Christmas and loves it! He doesn't want to go to sleep without it on.  It does automatically shut off, which is great. It covers almost the whole ceiling with stars.  I would recommend to anyone.",1
"I've been using the Diaper Dekor Plus for over a year and a half. The old bags used to work perfectly, and the product deserved 5 stars then. But with the new bio-degradable bags the nursery stinks.... I'm on the market for a new product, the Diaper Dekor is going to the trash.",0
Scratchy fabric,0
"I used to buy the Witch Hazel you buy in the stores but they all usually contain 14% Alcohol.  But in duing my research I came upon this product.  I really do believe it works.  My face is so much clearer, that's why I'll continue to purchase this product.",1
"All I can say at this time is that when I last spoke to my son he said &#34; I'm going to be using  it a lot&#34;, he & daughter-in-law are both outdoor people and say its better then pushing a stroller around all the time, just take the baby out of the car seat and put him in the carrier.  If they love it then that's all that matters to me.",1
"My daughter LOVES to suck and chew on my hands and fingers ( and anyone elses for that matter!), but I have had the hardest time finding a toy that she will spend more than 2 or 3 minutes with.  She loves this toy! She will gnaw on it for 30 or 40 minutes at a time quite happily. It has a texture that is soft and flexible like real fingers, it has an easy to hold handle and the little ""fingers"" fit perfectly in her mouth. Plus it makes a fun rattle noise.  I plan to buy her a couple more AND to give them to all my pregnant friends!!!",1
"I had the Avent Isis disposable system and sometimes it would take 30 minutes or more to get a couple ounces.  After purchasing this item I have been successfully getting 6 oz or more in a matter of about 15 minutes!  The item is a little noisy but leaves one of your hands free to keep entertaining the baby, unlike the Avent that takes both hands to make it work.  I am selling the Avent and LOVING the medela.  For the price difference, I should have just bought the Medela first.",1
"I have 4 different monitors and this is the only One I use because it has huge range, is interference free and the image is very clear",1
We purchased the yellow circles lovey & our baby just loves it & so do we! So soft & colorful & I love the fact that these are hand made by moms (& with quality materials!) Highly recommended.. every little one should have one :),1
The old straight line design pops off less. You will be popping it back in the holes constantly and so you will experience more spills if you don't check it each time you give the cup to your child.,0
This potty/is great. Now my little one can go potty by himself if needed. Before this he used to stand on a stool and lean over the toilet and hold on to the back of the seat. Sometimes the stool would and I wasn't crazy about him putting his hands all over the toilet seat. This little urinal is the perfect height. No stools needed. And no need to touch the toilet. He loves it. Delivery was fast too.,1
"Much sturdier and better quality wood that i expected. not cheap press board like most of my college furniture. Instructions are fairly easy to understand (8 out of 10, as some of the drawings are crazy confusing). Fit together snugly and easily with just a screw driver and the included tool.Took close to two hours for me and the prego wife to put together but we worked slowly and cautiously to insure a clean build. And we succeeded.However, one negative. The unit arrived in a near destroyed box. Not sure if that is Athena, Amazon or UPS, but regardless, that really stunk. The lid was completely loose (all of the tape was broken) and when I opened it it looked like someone picked the box up and shook it. The contents were scattered and in disarray.After removing each piece, confirming I had everything, and inspecting each piece, I was able to confirm that there were no scratches on any piece.",1
"I LOVE this monitor.  I put the volume only on 2-3 (the volume goes up to 6, as far as the number of buttons go), and it works perfectly for me.  NO static. It just sounds like 'outside night silence', which is completely fine for sleeping, and then I hear my baby's breathing. Every little breath and sound.  After having my baby sleep in a bassinet next to me for the first 3 months, I couldn't sleep the first couple of nights with her in her crib in another room.  But now, with her sounds, I can be reassured and sleep again.  It really is an amazing product as far as range too. Because when the baby and I are sleeping, and my husband is eating cereal in the conjoined room next to the baby room, i can hear the crunching inside his mouth! For those of you who are light sleepers, this may not be appealing. But to this mother, again, I'm reassured that because of this, I can hear everything - good, or potentially bad.  Great product, especially for the price.",1
Its easy to put together but try to close and open the stroller its kind of hard other than that its a very easy to maneuver.,0
"This was part of my grandson's set and I used it on the diaper cakes for decoration first, then to the washer and then to the crib. Beautiful sheets! Great Quality!!!",1
"These are basically ice cube trays with a lid.  People complain about the lid, but all you have to do is run it under hot water for a few seconds, then it fits fine. Definitely a good buy!Just boil baby food for a few minutes and put in food processor. Then fill into the trays and freeze.  I like to pop them out and save them in labeled zip lock bags so there's more room in my freezer. This way you can create an entire menu.UPDATE:  My only issue with the little slots is--they are too small, they should be deeper.  Still a good product...but you can use regular ice cube trays as well.UPDATE:  I was at Bed, Bath, and Beyond and saw something almost identical, ice cube trays with lids..they cost about $6.  I should've just purchased from there..oh well.",1
"I wanted to keep my child out of a few of our cabinets.  Since we unfortunately don't have knobs on most of our cabinets I needed to go with an internal latching device.  I didn't want to use a magnetic one and have to worry about losing the &#34;key&#34; so I purchased these.I like that it prevents the cabinet from slamming closed, though that has not been a big problem (yet) on our other, unsecured cabinets.These are a little bit tricky to get used to, but once you do they're not too bad for an adult to use.  The major issue with these is that they're kind of difficult to install.  Even using the template, I found it difficult to get the latch to line up with the hook portion and I found myself drilling extra holes just to get it to the point where the latch would &#34;hit the target&#34; when I closed the cabinets.  It would be better if the part that it latches on to was longer to give you a little more horizontal leeway when installing.",0
"I love this stroller - the versatility, use as a double, ease of use. I was expecting increased weight and it being harder to push around with two....it is a double. However....it drives me insane that the front wheels wobble when I walk with it!!! Without the wobble, super easy to push. With wobble, like pushing through sand. I am furious that I paid this much for a stroller, and I have to walk very slowly to keep the wheels from wobbling.",0
This is a great idea to help a new mommy free up her hands while shopping or walking for exercise.  A back pack type carrier.  Someone must have experimented with a worn out back pack,1
This bag is spacious and stylish.  I look forward to gifting it to my sister who will have a baby.  The product arrived as stated and it arrived in a timely manner.,1
Love the 4.0 more than the Freetime.  Dries so much faster.  Great product and the color is fun and bright.,1
"Bought it for a trip to England during winter with our 7 mo born/raised in Florida. She was happy and warm during the whole time with only a onesie underneath. Was good during rainy days too, fairly waterproof. Worked on britax car seat and stroller. Wash very well in washing machine.",1
"I purchased mine from target, since its cheaper from there. My 4 mo old loves this little bed, he has gotten spoiled in it and will hardly sleep in his crib. A good buy for sure",1
Fills up quickly and can get over crowded. Worked ok for me because my daughter didn't really take bottles so very little was stored on it. But if you have bottles with lots of parts or go through a lot of bottles I wouldn't recommend it.,0
"Worked great for our trip, my son loved eating his breakfast and playing on the tray. Great for long trips.",1
"We bought this monitor for our newborn about nine months ago after doing extensive research on Amazon and other sites.  Very good monitor for a great price.  But after about 5 months, it conked out.  Both receivers started emitting a buzzing sound that was unbearable.  We moved them, tried to adjust them, etc., all to no avail.  So we called customer service and they sent us a new one.  That one also worked swell . . . for about 4 months, when the buzzing started again.  Again called customer service and they're shipping us yet another one.  Kudos to their customer service, but the monitor itself does not seem to last.",0
"Easy, perfect portions. Simple to wash, dishwasher safe, all around a great purchase. I'm very pleased with this purchase. Thank you.",1
This was too good. I accidentally fell on the ground today. But there is no damage. The baby is like,1
"Apparently our doorway isn't perfectly typical in dimension -- this has a bar with holes drilled into it that adjust the majority of the size in increments of maybe half an inch.  Then the instructions claim you can &#34;twist&#34; part of the locking mechanism to tighter it just a little more -- only the mechanism has a square hole on a square rod -- there's not &#34;twisting&#34; possible.  I tried to make the gate a little bigger than our doorway and pretty much force it to fit, but that didn't work for me.  I'm returning this for a truly adjustable gate that will work for our doorway.  Not a bad product, just poorly described and not adjustable.",0
"Very nice, soft set.  I have one, and can't find it again.  Very happy with Moon Bear set.",1
This works with our Denali and with our jeep.  It stays in place and blocks the sun well.  I would like two more.,1
This thermometer is wonderful!  No longer do I question whether the water is too hot for my little one. It's cute and functional!,1
This pacifier is awesome because you can see the little mouths at work when you look into the hole. my daughter also loved to stick her finger in the hole and chew on the sides when she was teething. Probably the best teething toy she has! the wubbanubs (pacifier attached to a small stuffed animal) are also adorable and really work with the baby's gasping reflex! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!,1
"Let me start by saying that this changing set is adorable. I have the ""Numbers"" set and everything about it is cute. The quality is really the issue. The changing set was still in a plastic package when I received it. Even thought it was still in plastic, I noticed some little dirt stains on the ""diapers"" canvas zipper bag. I let it go and figured I'd try to wash it later. The first time I opened the ""diapers"" zipper bag, the zipper broke! I've read about Suger Booger's zippers breaking but usually on their little plastic wipes bags--not on a metal zipper! I was shocked how cheaply made it was. Putting these serious issues aside, I dislike the length of the changing mat as well. Even if the baby's head is on the mesh it's still way too short. I'll have to bring a seperate changing pad with it which kind of defeats the purpose. I also have the Munchkin portable changing set and I have to say--it is much higher quality. This one wins in cuteness but if you can't actually use it--does it really matter how cute it is? It isn't much more compact than the Munchkin either. Again, it's sooo cute but not worth it. I wanted to love it--I just can't. It's too poorly made to even like. Sugar Booger needs to work on quality. They have the ""adorable"" factor down but really, who wants something that falls apart on the first use? Not me!",0
"Overall the idea and graphics are very cute.  But word to the wise, don't lose the instructions like I did.  I find this product incredibly non-intuitive.  I cannot figure out how to set the three clocks.  I've emailed the company in Switzerland to see if they could resend me the instructions.  There seem to be three clock settings on mine and there are the tiniest little graphics that seem to describe each one, but I can't see it to save my life.  I'm about to go find a magnifier to see what it is.  Anyway, I thought the first clock is the time, the 2nd is the time you want them to say it is okay to wake up and I have no idea what the third clock is for.  I think it is for the alarm but I do not want to use that function in the event they are sleeping in late!  My kid wakes up at 3, 4, 5 am every day and we are losing our minds.  I already ordered another product that is a real clock and hope it is much easier to setup.  I think they should post the instructions on their website but couldn't find anything.",0
"This little potty is a great idea. It takes up very little space. I kind of hate sending those bags to the landfill, but it's better than going in a nasty crab-crawling public bathroom, where your 3 year old is trying to put their hands on the gross seat to keep from falling in, and then asking questions about the condom machine.I wish the back was covered in the folded position, but I guess that would add weight to it.Excellent item.A woman with a skinny butt can use it, too, but I wouldn't know personally about that. :)",1
great for babies who can hold their heads up. perfect for parents who need their hands free while carrying their baby.,1
"We bought it to hang on the door frame. Unless you have an extra extra wide door frame, this jumper would not work well. When my daughter sits on it and moves around, she will bump to the sides of the door frame. After a couple of tries, we decided to return it and bought her a walker instead.",0
"My daughter loves them and the suction works perfect for me so far, bowls a lil too small, but they are ok for now as she is still quite young....  will update later if any problems arrives.",1
"I ordered this product as my 12 month old has been teething and he seemed to enjoy munching on my friend's teething necklace. Her's is made of a more &#34;stone-like&#34; material that is more attractive than this one. This one does the trick and the baby loves munching on it, but it is not really attractive enough to wear out and about. Dog hair also seems to adhere to it like a magnet, which is kind of gross. I ordered the &#34;dark blue&#34; and it is really more of a jade green.",0
"I loved the look, it was very cute. I am only giving 3 stars, though, because the letters are very thin. I tore 2 while removing from the backing, despite being careful. Most of the letters tore when removing from the wall, making it one use only.",0
Love them!Trying to find a smaller version to use instead of rope ties for my other cupboads. Have placed one on the fridge and the other on the dishwasher. Very happy!!Easy to install and easy to use,1
"I researched a ton of double strollers, sit and stands and tandems before I chose to purchase this particular stroller.  If you're looking for a light weight stroller for 2 kids (toddler and a younger child) and do not want to spend in the $300's and $400's, this is the one to buy.  It was really hard to find a stroller that can accommodate 2 kids that is reasonably priced, lightweight, and had the nice parent trays, etc.  I belive this stroller has most of those qualities. Pros:  I love the parent organizer.  I can fit 2 drinks, my wallet and 2 cell phones comfortably in it.  It also has an oversized umbrella that can cover both child.  You can move it and adjust it to block out the sun pretty well.  The color of this stroller is very bright, but I like it because it's easily spotted in a crowd of strollers, which makes it easy to find.  Cons: The basket on the bottom is smaller than my ideal.  It's also harder to access because the seats cover up most of the open space where you can stick your hands in.  Currently, we've been putting a baby car seat in the front so we are able to stick a diaper bag on the front seat under the car seat and it works better for access.  The pull-out seat (where the older child sits) is able to pull out further (if child wants to sit) and slides back in when the child stands, but when they're sitting, it slides back a lot and I end up having to pull it out further for my son.  It's a little annoying.  It doesn't make very tight turns so be careful with that.  It never flipped on me, but I had it off 2 wheels at one point.  Also, I'm not sure how it will work when my son is a little taller (he's currently 33"" tall).  It's hard to put him in the pull out seat because you have to watch out for the handle bar.  Also, it seems like if he were taller, his head might hit the umbrella?  Not sure on that one. The parent organizer is in front of his face when he's sitting.  He's able to pull out some of our drinks from it.  It's only a problem now, but when they're a little older, they wouldn't be messing with the items in the parent tray.",1
"In preparation for our new baby, we needed a great transition bed for our son that just turned 3 yrs old.  We had no problems with the delivery of the product; however the espresso color was a little bit lighter than we expected.  Assembly was pretty simple (per my husband).  We did find the support boards to not be as secure as we would like.  They actually bowed when we pressed down on them.  For reinforcement, we attached a couple of 2x4 boards under the frame.  Needless to say now it is very sturdy.  Overall, this was a great choice and good quality product.  Our son loves his ""big boy bed"".",1
"The pay yard itself seems quite well made.  I would have rated it a 5 except for the directions--especially about how to take it back down.  It took me a long time to figure out that, at the middle of each top bar, there are two hidden latches (one on each side of the hinge) that must be squeezed up from the bottom of the cross bar in order to unlock the hinge.  The directions to &#34;lift up&#34; and &#34;push in&#34; do not describe the unlocking action very well in my estimation.  Other than that, highly recommended.",1
"Theses bottles are the most convenient we've tried.  Yes, they will leak if the lid is not on right - my wife originally hated them.  If they leak, just unscrew the bottle, and reseat the top carefully.  We both like them now after we found the trick with the lid.  I think the most important feature of any bottle is the way they allow air into the bottle to displace the fluid the baby drinks.  Some of them do not work at all, and the baby can't get any milk out since it's too hard to suck out.  These bottles seem to work pretty well in this area.",0
"Got it for my one month old because of big wheels and a carry cot option that can fold down and does not require extra storage space. Had it for a month. So far - love it. It's a little bit on a heavy side but those large wheels are great for the beach and parks (we live in Hawaii). I am taking my little one for long walks in the morning and at night and he just sleeps there and I know his spine is doing great which is very important at this age. Baby is comfy sleeping in it, not like those poor babies stuck in car seats where they can't stretch or lie flat. The carry cot has a wood at the bottom and nice little breathable mattress, so it's firm but comfy. Very good amortization. Happy mama.",1
"I want to give this stroller 5 stars- and I would have *BUT* the straps are hard as HECK to get undone.  When you have a screaming kid wanting to get out~ it's no fun yanking hard to get the stupid buckle undone.  I plan on calling and complaining because of this.  I was tempted to use scissors at one point to get my son out of this~ it's THAT bad.  On the plus side- it IS a great stroller, light weight and I LOVE using it~ if it weren't for the straps!",1
"I bought this to use as a diaper/snack bag for my baby boy to take to Sunday school.  It's worked out great.  It's just the right size for a couple of diapers, a sippy cup and a small snack.",1
"We bought this scale to measure breastmilk after feedings as well and were deceived by the specs. It seemed at first glance to measure to 0.1 oz and 0.001 kg which means it would measure to 1 gram. However, we figured out that it is a postal scale and that is why it rounds to the 0.5 ounce after 2 lbs. (It also rounds to 10 grams.) This means that if you are trying to measure breastmilk, it would round to 0.5 ounces and would defeat the purpose. There is a way around this. If you are looking to measure breast milk, measure in grams. You can get accuracy to +/- 10 mL b/c it rounds to 10 grams at either end. If the start weight is 3000, it could be 2995 or 3005. If the end weight is 3100, it could be 3095 or 3105. So the increase is 90-110, so +/-10. If your baby needs to eat 100 mL, then his/her weight should go up about 100 grams after feeding. (+/- 10) (Denisity of water is about the same as breastmilk so 1 g = 1 mL.) Measuring this way is the best you can do with scales out there (I checked everyone available) unless you have 100's of dollars to spend.",0
"If you want to avoid plastic bottles, there arent many options left. Most of the bottle companies now make plastic bottles with nipples that only fit their bottles. Most of them are now BPA free, but what will be the next ""BPA"" chemical in plastic.We tried these bottles, the Doc Brown glass bottles, the Pur stainless steel bottles and the organic kidz stainless steel bottles. These evenflo bottles are the best. They come in two convenient sizes, are easy to clean, and not over priced. They come with covers which are nice and our baby actually likes these evenflo nipples the best and we tried a lot of nipples, including these orthodontic and other fancy nipples. The Evenflo slow flo nipples work great for those who are also breastfeeding. Best of all, the Evenflo glass bottles and the nipples are widely available, and can even be found at Walmart.Despite being glass, they are very durable and it would take a fairly substantial blow to crack or break them. They have volume markings on the sides so it is simple to measure out for a 2 oz, 3 oz, 4 oz, etc bottle. I've kept one filled with water for formula in diaper bag with no leaks and no cracks.My wife uses these bottles with her medela pump and they attach easily and work great.The stainless steel bottles dont use a standard sized nipple, and you cant see how much milk is left inside which is a big negative. Also, the Pur bottles dont come with a cover for the nipple which makes no sense for travel.The Doc Brown bottles have too many parts to keep track of and clean, and we didnt notice any difference with regards to gas, fussiness, etc when using that bottle.Evenflo is the way to go!",1
Got the for my second baby but haven't used it yet. But I did use it with my first child and love it so much. Great buy!!!,1
"Note this review is from the husband of a wife that uses it, so I can't be very detailed.  Also my wife hasn't used any other breast pumps before.  But it looks and seems like a very nice breast pump.  My wife uses it daily and it only takes about 10 mins for her to get out all her milk, which seems really good from what I've read.  Not too loud, standing at the doorway I have to poke my head in to even hear if it's running.  The reason she wanted this one was so that the milk didn't get in the lines and I have to say the design on this is pretty nice, definetly can't get any milk in the lines and I can see how I wouldn't even want to deal with a Medela if that were to happen, that would be a pain to clean.",1
"we bought this for our son who just turned 7 mos.  He just started sitting up so it is perfect for him.  He is of average height for his age and he is already on the middle setting for height so I can see how 'tall' babies may be too tall/outgrow this walker.  He loves being able to cruise around, it seems well-made and comfortable, and sturdy.  It was very easy to put together and came quickly.  The reason I didn't give it five stars is the same comments many people had, 1) it seems a little too low even on the highest setting for a tall baby, 2) the 'bounce' feature is kind of stiff, not very bouncy like traditional bouncers, and 3) there isn't as much to 'do' if the baby is going to be stationary compared to many of the saucers/bouncers on the market...overall though, very good, well-made, nice walker.  our son should get a lot of use out of it.  and it's cute!",1
"Cute product, I bought it and gave it to my sister in law.  She used it to explain to her other child, about her younger baby with whom she was pregnant with.  She showed her son how to wrap the little baby, and used the different size to display mamma, and older brother, and the little lamb for baby.",1
"Totally meet my expectations, i've only had it for a month but it is great, good reach, good battery, the talk option on the parent unit has been really helpful on my two year old",1
"my son loved the soothie pacifier but he'd always drop it then i'd have to wash it before giving it back. so i got this clip. it's so adorable even tho the bee looks like an alien, but the pot is too heavy and the clip isn't big enough so it doesn't stay on or it hangs and would pull his shirt. it is cute though.",0
"Put this in my heirloom crib with red gingham sheets. Ties easily around the sides and is a nice addition to my baby boy's nursery. High quality fabric, should last a long time.",1
"I've used moonpads in the past and these are super great. Easy to rinse. Easy to wash. Great coverage (true to size)! I've used them for about a year and as long as I remember not to put them in the dryer, I'm confident they'll last many more to come! Highly recommend.",1
"I like these towels, they have cute designs.  They are a little on the thin side, but I have found that most baby towels are.  My complaint with them is that I received them with ugly black smudges on a couple.  I washed them hoping they'd come off, but they did not.  It's not a huge deal, not enough to return them, but I am a bit obsessive about spots.  I don't like them.  Oh well.",0
"Definitely has a better view than the mirror I had for my first baby, I can see her clearly, the remote fits securely on my visor and has good range, and the music and light is a great distraction that does the trick. However, the light doesn't stay on long enough to get a good look and it could be a bit brighter.But overall I love it :)",1
"I have several of these snack cups that I've used over the past few years with two children. These greatly reduce likelihood of spilling snacks. The lids are flexible with cutouts, allowing kiddos to push their hands into the cups and get their goodies. For the most part, kids can easily learn how to use these. They may be slightly annoyed that the lids slow down their snacking a little, but this is no problem in my book. These are not completely spill proof. If a kid tips it upside down and bangs it around, crumbs will fall out. If a kid reaches in and grabs a whole handful of snacks, some may spill out out there hands. But, overall all these lessen the spills and mess.I use a pacifier clip similar to this: http://www.amazon.com/BooginHead-PG-BF-PaciGrip-Black-Flourish/dp/B005CX0208/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1348806657&sr;=8-2&keywords;=pacifier+clipI attach it to the cup handles and secure the clip to keep kiddos from tossing the cup on while in the stroller or shopping cart.",1
"This is the second infant seat I've owned.  My first was a Graco. I loved it and would have kept it had it not expired; and probably would have bought another one had Graco not changed the handle style. So, I went on the hunt for a new infant car seat and believe the Chicco Keyfit is one of the best seats on the market.  Why?1) It has great safety ratings.2) Babies fit so comfortably in it no matter their size small or big. My little guy didn't like the infant insert under him, so I just took it out and he fit it fine  at 7lbs.3) It easily snaps into it's base.4) The straps are so easy to use and they don't get twisted or tangled ever!5) It's easy to clean and I really care about that!!!I would say the only cons about it are:1) The fabric can be warm for summer causing baby to sweat - We live in Utah so we have hot dry summers.2) The sun shade only covers half of the infant...  (My Graco sunshade came completely over the baby.)3) It doesn't fit in the top of grocery carts.  However, I'm only 5'1"" and I can't see over the seats when they're placed on top, so it actually isn't a problem for me to put the seat in the large part of the cart.4) It is a tad bigger and heavier than my old Graco infant seat, but I can handle it fine at 5'1"" and 100lbs.  My arms are getting really strong. "")Overall, I love the Chicco Keyfit and would recommend it to anyone looking for a safe and comfortable infant seat.",1
"I had high hopes for this monitor based on the reviews but I am not satisfied.  I have been using this monitor for about a month now and it has several issues.  The stand by feature quit working about 3 weeks in, so now it stays on all the time which is a problem because it doesnt stay charged in the first place.  In addition now it doesnt want to charge even when its plugged in, the red light will come on for a few seconds and go off.  Doesnt really help me in the night when my baby is in his room and the monitor is off because its not charging when I think it is.  I bought this a few months before he was born so I was unaware of the issues and now its to late to return.",0
"When we got this, I was not sure about it. I just did not see the point of yet another blanket. My almost-three year old, however, loves it. She has not put it down since receiving it and now easily goes down for a nap, as long as ""ladybug"" is in her bed (we have the ladybug version).I love the handle on top, great for my daughter to easily carry it and hold the two or three other things she wants to bring along and still hold the railing to go up and down stairs. It was easy to fold the blanket into the pocket too-- something I worried about until I tried it. I just stuffed the blanket in, mushed it around a bit and it looked like a ladybug again.",1
"We brought home our first baby this morning from the hospital.  After using disposables for 3 days, we got home and switched to cloth as planned.  i put one of these liners in and it worked like a charm. She went both number 1 and number 2 and the liner let the liquid through to the diaper and kept the tarry newborn poop on the liner....not a trace went through to the cloth.  Dropped the liner in the toilet and flushed....gone.  Dropped the cloth diaper with pee in the pail...done.  No need to scrape or rinse the cloth diaper....this is an incredible product.",1
"Love, this stroller!!!  Was concerned about the negative reviews from various sites, but decided to try it anyway.  This Sit n Stand is a lifesaver!  Toddlers love standing on the back platform, while the younger one sits in the front.  The child in the back can sit, if he/she chooses, while seat belted to the jump seat.  Mall runs are more peaceful, as the child can sit or stand (on back only).  Some children dislike sitting for long periods of time.  This stroller enables them to stand too, so you can keep shopping.  This stroller folds up smaller than the Graco DuoGlider, is easier to maneuver/turn, handles tight turns with ease (one handed even), rolls smoothly, and absorbs a lot of shock.  Better than the Graco DuoGlider.  It has only one snack tray (front), but when you child is old enough to stand on the back, they should be coordinated enough to eat from snack cups or to sit at the table anyway.  I have a double snack cup that attaches to just about any stroller frame ($15 at Toys r Us) and works perfectly for the back seat of this Baby Trend.  The front snack tray folds into two positions, and is completely removable.  It is also big and allows young ones their own table for eating.  Love it!!!!!  The canopy covers both heads, the kid in front and back, when seated.  No cons to this stroller.  Took it on gravel, dirt, and grass for a test drive and no issues.  It even glides smoothly/easily on grass!  The storage basket underneath has a big open area in the rear, which makes putting objects into it easy.  With the Graco DuoGlider, I had to lift the back seat up to fit some items into the storage basket.  This Baby Trend is perfect, modern, sleek, lightweight (about 26 lbs) and easy to use.  The Graco DuoGlider weighs about 32 lbs.  Assembly took 2 minutes.  It comes 95% assembled.  You just attach the tray, canopy, rear wheels, and rear platform (all pop into place, no tools needed).  I traded in my Graco for this Baby Trend and have NO REGRETS.  I forgot to mention it is VERY sturdy and stable, as well.  It is also easy to transport in trunks of average cars because it folds up so small.",1
"This product met my expectations. The black and white toile print was lovely, and the kit is easy to unfold/fold. It would be great if the wipes pocket could be accessing without having to open the kit for between diaper change clean-up needs. I would also prefer a softer, more padded changing surface. However, the pad is easy to wipe clean, and the kit is very slim and easy to tuck in diaper bag.",1
"Love these blankets. Had them for each of my girls and they held up well for 6 years. Got them for my baby boy and they have become his lovey. We have several for various locations. I can vouch for the washability of the blue dog, brown and white monkey, green pea, and pink ladybug.",1
We purchased this for our granddaughter so that she can look at photos of relatives and close friends who aren't around every day.  There are plenty of sleeves and 4 x 6 photos fit in easily.  It's very cute.,1
Bought this for my daughter in law. She said it's the best thing ever! Displays right temperature for baby. Highly recommend!,1
"Bought this for my 6 month old grand nephew.  It is soft, sweet and cuddly.  The music is soft and not tinny - the box is well placed inside so when he snuggles with it - it does not bother him.  Good buy",1
"Good idea but too dangerous. I really wanted to like this but sadly it's just not usable for us. The cross joints on each panel have screws in them and the end of the screw ends up facing the inside of the play yard.  So if your baby stumbles and falls and happens to graze or heaven forbid hit that piece, it will likely cause serious injury. Also my son likes to sit and bounce up and down when he plays or gets excited and he tends to rock back sometimes and when he does his head is right at that screw level. So sadly we cannot use this.",0
"I think Amazon should delete this seller. I bought this item as a gift for my niece and when I looked it over after receiving it, it looked like it was a store return. The seller said they would look into it and then didn't and ignored my emails. I contacted Amazon about the seller feedback I left but Amazon said I could not change it, I wanted to lower my rating on this seller. I would have returned the item but had promised it to my niece and didn't want to disappoint her. Really rotten to be selling kids stuff as new when it is not. Most will probably buy as a gift like I did then stuck with it and no time to get another and return it. I'd rate this seller as a -5 if I could.The actual Scooby Doo Hugs Throw and Pillow are really nice (after I cleaned it up) and my niece really likes it. It is soft and plush as described. Kids will love it but make sure it is a new one!",0
"This is great.  I don't have time to wash tupperware.  Yes this may seem like it would cost more for having convenience, but I don't need dish soap or water and i dont have to buy expensive tupperware that i have to replace, nor am I hauling tupperware around.  Daycare can simply throw them away.  And I'm a germaphob. This keeps everything clean!! One time use is easy and clean!!",1
Great baby shower gift. Good &iacute;tem for a Little child. buy it rigth now.. thank you very much .. ..,1
Got these for my son when he was about five months old nod he is now nine months and he still loves playing with them. One has a bell inside one has a crinkle sound. They are durable yet soft enough for him to gnaw on. And I just threw them on the delicate cycle in the washer and they were fine. Nice purchase!,1
"I read the other reviews about the swing dying quickly, but thought maybe they did something wrong, like put a heavy baby in it or something. Well, mine died after 6 months for no reason. My baby was not even at the weight limit yet. For the price of this swing, I had planned on either selling it, gifting it, or donating it when I was done with it. Instead it has to go in the trash. It's such a waste!BUT, until it died, I really loved it. I specifically wanted a swing that would plug in because the other one I had ate through batteries so fast, it was getting to be expensive. The cover is soft and cozy and machine washable. The mobile is fascinating to baby. The colors of this swing look so nice in my living room (compared to having bright primary colors!) The music speaker points down to baby, which is good and bad. If you are watching TV, baby will hear the swing music instead. However, sometimes if the house was quiet, it seemed like the music on the lowest volume was too loud, especially for pointing right at baby's face.The swing instructions explain to drape a blanket over newborn to have the blanket drag on the floor if the swing is to fast. This worked perfectly for us. We could control the speed based on how much blanket was dragging. And the swing was easy to assemble, I did it myself, at 9 months pregnant.If this swing hadn't died after 6 months, I'd have rated it 5 stars.",0
"This car seat just came today and I could not be more excited!  My car is a Ford Escape and I have the very safe, but very large Safety First Air 65 in it.  I love the seat, but it does not come close to fitting my husband's Scion Tc, which is about the size of a clown car.  With our infant seat in the back, the front seat had to be pushed and tilted forward and no one could sit there.  I ordered the Britax Roundabout seat b/c some reviews said that it fit in smaller cars.  And it fit!  It is rear facing, reclined all the way and it fits!  I can sit comfortably in the front seat of the clown car again!  It's like a miracle.  And my daughter seems extremely comfortable and happy in it.  This car seat is a MUST if you have a tiny car, but also want a really safe and nice seat.  The price was good for the quality and it was also easy to install with the LATCH system.  I love, love, love this seat!",1
This is a must for any baby. My son is 1 year old and loves all the different music and instruments. It's also easy for your little one to push the big buttons.  The only thing I don't like about this product is that there is no volume control.  Other than that it's a good solid toy.,1
"They have been on my shower floor for a few months now and they are still stuck on well.  Before I put them down I followed the instrution to the letter.  I used soft scub to clean the floor, and the I use alcohol to make sure that it was clean.  Would recommend this product",1
"I chose this bag in the first place, because it did not look like a regular diaper bag, but I was not sure of its size. Well, it is as large as a regular dipaer bag and it is very cute. I have not started using it, yet; but it does look practical.",1
"I purchased the elephant blanket as a gift for a friend's baby.  The blanket is a lot smaller than I expected.  I estimate that it's about 10"" x 10"" (sorry, I gave it away without measuring it).  However, it's a nice size for a baby to hug.One side is made of fuzzy fleece and the other plain polyester.  Both sides are soft, the fleece side especially so.  The image on Amazon accurately represents the color and detail of the elephant's face.  I was able to purchase this item for about half the list price, which I thought was a good value.",1
"Arrived when expected, thank you!",1
"My first aden + anais purchase was their Muslin Swaddle Wraps and I love them.  So of course when I saw these burp cloths/bibs I had to try them.  I am really glad I did because I love, love, love these bibs! I was aprehensive at the cost, but they are so worth the money!1) They are thick and very high quality.2) They cover a large area so no mess.3) They are a burp cloth and a bib so they have a longer range of use.4) The more you wash them, the softer they get!5) When using them as a bib, they have a snap, not Velcro!6) The prints match their blanket prints and I love to be coordinated :-)",1
Fun rinse tray for nebulizer gadgets,1
"I bought this after my swaddle pods became too small, and this is so much nicer! The material is a little thicker and stretchier. After wearing it, it wasn't stretched out like swaddlepods tend to do after use. I love that it let's my little girl choose where her arms are, but keeps her from startling herself awake. I highly recommend these over everything else and other brands.",1
The Tubing is working great with my Medela pump in style pump. And the price was muh better than in the stores!,1
"I originally just gave the nanny a pad of paper to write down this information for my little one. She would take him to the park and leave the pad behind - I was getting incomplete/inaccurate information when she wohld get home at the end of the day and try to remember naps/feedings/diaper changes. I wanted something she could take with her and also a way to better control how she reported information. This was the perfect solution! Now I'm getting all the information I wanted. There is a very helpful example of how to fill it out. It also has a pouch for additional documents and a section up front for emergency contact info. Each page goes from 7 - 6. This works for me because the nanny starts at 7am and ends before 6pm. I use an app on my phone for tracking when I'm with the baby. I transfer the info from this notebook to my phone. My only complaint: the space is pretty small - they provide useful shorthand, but it's a little difficult to fit some of the info in the space provided. Also, some of the other reviews complain about the 7 - 6 time format. This isn't a real problem for me, but I suppose if you wanted to track an entire day, you would have to use two pages - not too big of a deal. 7am - 6pm is pretty much perfect for daycare/nanny/caregiver situation.",1
This was recommended by friends so I order one for my grandson.  He loves kicking and making the keys sound.  Good leg movement for a baby.,1
"I used to have a Summer Infant monitor. (read my old review on that one)It wasn't digital, so picture quality was so-so.THis one - has a decent picture quality and almost no noise.I have returned it and bought the Lorex LW2002W Digital Portable Color LCD Wireless Surveillance System (read my review on that one as well).Here's what I discovered after using for a week.Receiver screen is too tiny.The picture is from way too far and that does not help with the size of the screen. You can basically see that there's a kid in the crib or there isn't :)) My camera is not positioned too high, it is about 5'5"" from the floor and just a little higher than my 3 year old can reach from his crib.The zoom-in feature is a good idea, but it blurs the picture too much, so basically useless.The receiver is way too small. Don't know if this is good for some people, but my previous Summer infant huge receiver was misplaced by my husband and we still can't find it. So this one would be a bigger challenge to find :)Also I figured that camera in color would not be useful for babies who are usually sleep in the darkened rooms, like mine. Night time - it would be black and white anyways, but daytime naps my son also takes with his shades totally closed - so black and white picture again. So if yours is the same - save money, get the black and white monitor.Hope this helps",0
"I liked the concept of the basic baby rattle, but the instructions on the box for washing are wrong.  They are ""Before first use and after each use, wash with hot soapy water, then rinse.""  I was wary of submerging them, as they didn't appear watertight, but didn't want to give them to my daughter without washing them.  I used a soapy dishcloth to wipe them and then rinsed them in running water; sure enough, water was stuck between the clear plastic covers and the silver rattle parts.  There's no way to separate the layers get the water out, and I'm assuming there will be mold eventually (I washed them a week ago and they are still wet inside).  Not sure if they designed them to be just wiped with a damp cloth like most other toys and the instructions were wrong or if the company thought they were waterproof but didn't test them.I talked to customer service through the chat on their website; they were quick to offer a voucher for the amount of the purchase price, but its only good in retail stores, not online.  They didn't really seem to be concerned with the problem; they said they hadn't heard of it before with this product.  Sounded like a canned line, but it is a newer product, so it is possible.  It would be a great product if they were waterproof, but I either had a customer service rep who didn't care, or they know all about the problem and have been instructed to pay out immediately.  I guess I'll follow my instinct next time and wipe with a damp cloth.",0
"At well past the danger of losing my baby at 19 weeks we started trying to prepare for our first daughter's arrival.  While I, unfortunately, know no time during pregnancy is free from danger the chances of losing my daughter at that point were less than .5%.  I was really interested in cloth diapering and ran across Kawaii brand.  I purchased 20 diapers for $120 and received 1 free.  I also received free shipping.  I was ecstatic.  I couldn't wait to receive them.  Unfortunately before I received my order my daughter was stillborn at 20.2 weeks.  We were devastated!  She was our dream.  I immediately contacted Kawaii and informed them of our circumstances.  I was informed their return policy stated that we had to pay to ship the diapers back to them and (as punishment for returning them) also pay for our free shipping. While I understand that every company has to have a return policy, for their protection, exceptions can be made for extenuating circumstances.  How heartless is it to punish a parent for losing a child???  I wasn't returning them because I didn't want them or like them, as a matter of fact I was looking forward to buying more.  So as punishment I would loose (minimum) $45 for a $120 order, which I really couldn't afford.  So now I'm forced to either keep these diapers and give MY baby's diapers as gifts to other babies (I'm sure that is going to be extremely hard) or sell them for what I can get out of them.  I feel it is extremely heartless to force a grieving parent into this situation.  From my experience I would not recommend Kawaii brand diapers based on their heartless business practices.Sincerely,Cynthia Petersen(Desperately Grieving Mother)",0
"Don't put this in the washer -- we purchased two of these to protect our minvan's leather seats from our boys' car seats.  They've both held up and other than the surface stains from spills, they were both in the same basic condition they were when we purchased them two years ago.  At least until my wife threw one of them into the washer.  The duomat got stuck between the washer's tub and outer wall and made a horrendous racket -- nearly burned out our new washer.  The washer tore up the mat, so we had to purchase a replacement.Our minivan's leather seats have been well protected by the two DuoMats we purchased two years ago.The DuoMats we purchased were a great investment.",1
"My first suggestion is to take your child with you to a store that allows you to try out the seat before you buy it. Put your child into the seat and check for a good fit. I was planning on buying a different seat, but my tall daughter had nearly out grown the seat I was looking at buying. I bought this one since there was some height growing room. I want to provide some positives and negatives:Positives:-VERY EASY TO INSTALL/change vehicles. Leveling does not seem to be a big problem like I have had with other seats.-Very, very, easy strap adjustment. Love this feature; it is pretty much a one click change. This comes in handy when you need to adjust for coats, jackets, or just differing thickness of clothing.-Can be used as rear/front facing.-5 point harness for added safety. (Should be used until child no longer requires a carseat/booster).-Nice material covering the seat.-Easy to clean.-High safety rating.-Most important... I feel that my daughter is safe in this seat.Negatives:-Expensive-This seat is large (both wide and tall). I would check to make sure it fits your vehicle(s).-Could use a little more padding.-Recline is difficult to use.-Not made for newborns/young infants. So... this is a transitional seat to be used for children over 1 year old and at least 22 lbs.Overall, I love this seat and my daughter loves her ""big girl"" seat also. I hope this helps someone out there. I highly recommend!",1
"We LOVE this brush and boy have we tried them all. My baby was very particular and we ended up trying most bottle brands and their corresponding brushes over a 2 month period. This is the best brush hands down! It holds up well, 8 mo and counting. We just purchased a second one for traveling. We currently use it with the Dr. Brown's bottles but like I said, it works with pretty much all of them. It also has a nice plastic hard case for the brush head which is nice for keeping it germ-free. Definitely one of my better baby purchases. Plus you can't beat the price, thanks Amazon!",1
ou should improve the buckle and how easy it is to get tyhe child out-Does not open/ claspse as easy as it should.Make for trouble in fire or bad accident!!!!!!Like it- but this could be a real problem.,0
The blanket is beautiful and the material is soft. It has a nice weave that is great for swaddling and the fabric breathes well. The company needs to tone down the attached tags. I guess they decided it was smart to attach the instructions as a tag but it's overkill.,1
This seat is much better than the Dora seat we had previously (and donated to our daycare so our daughter would go there as well).  The Dora seat seemed to get dirty easily between the cushion and the handle piece and it had a &#34;splash guard&#34; that made getting on and off or having them bed over to wipe a pain - sometime literally.  This seat is great and has none of the issues we noted with our previous seat.,1
"large and easy to clean but very thin, which makes it easy to transport but not ideal for the actual play area i have setup for my daughter, good to put away and bring out - just wish it were a bit thicker",0
"I love these bottles. They do not leak, they fit standard breastpumps, and the shape made them easier for my little one to hold. Also, they have minimal parts -- helpful when you're washing and prepping bottles each day.I didn't like the lack of a bottle cap (not nipple cap, bottle cap) for these bottles. I used the Dr. Brown's bottle cap on them which was good but not great as I got some leaking along the cap threads if the bottle was tilted or turned upside down.One other benefit of these bottles is that the collars fit the prepared nursette bottles of formula. Just screw on and go.",1
"I purchased this ring to replace my more expensive engagement ring that has turned and looks like junk. I love the quality of this ring so much that I visited the seller's website and we purchased an eternity ring for me to wear along side it as my wedding set. The photos do not do this ring justice. It is absolutely beautiful. The band is connected seamlessly to the prongs, which makes this ring look like it costs a few thousand dollars instead of under 30. The size of the CZ is just right, making it very believable. I could easily see paying 3 times as much for this ring based on its quality.",1
"This was really adorable, it is such a little thing, but we were redecorating our daughter's room and this is so much nicer than the sort of junky tan switch plate cover that everyone has.  It does make a difference, and it is quite sturdy.",1
"This stool gets the job done, the grip strips keep your feet from slipping off and the adjustable angle is a nice feature. Only two complaints is ours didn't come with assembly instructions and that it would be even better if the height could adjust for different height furniture. Otherwise a solidly made product that works as it should.",1
"I gave this monitor one star because it is dangerous.  It will randomly turn off during the day or night with no way of knowing.  One night I woke up to my son crying and the monitor showed a picture of him sleeping and silent.  It had frozed or something).  We returned it and got a new one thinking it was just a fluke, but it happened a second time with another one.  Don't buy this if you want any piece of mind that your child is safe.",0
"1. Cheap Price (+)2. Smells Weird (-)3. When you pull out one tissue, next one will stay out like dry tissue (-)",0
Very sturdy and well made. They are very classy and I am sure these will last a very long time.,1
"I like that the swing can compact into a smaller swing but that's really it. The swing makes to much noise when it's moving. And the sound is annoying. The straps can not be adjusted when using the body insert. I can't use it with my 3 week old because then I can't buckle him in. And for the price I paid, all it does is swing. I thought I read that it played music and vibrated but it doesn't. I'm actually considering buying a new one because I'm not happy and my infant doesn't like it either",0
"These pouches are easy to fill, easy to clean and easy for the baby to eat from.  He barely makes a mess with these. Very happy I got these and would recommend them to anyone!",1
"This is a must with a new baby.  So many bottles and nipples and droppers, etc. that constantly need to be washed and dried.  This rack looks good and has enough &#34;sprouts&#34; to cover all the bottles and accessories we need air dried.  The base has a leaf pattern with holes where you can stick droppers and pacifiers and other small stuff.",1
"These are perfect. We decided to try these and started with one on the stroller and ended up buying a 2nd and ordering 2 more to go with the Travel System that was a baby shower gift for my sister. We considered them a must have at that point. She is every bit as in love with them as we are.They are very sturdy, priced just right and hold quite a bit. It is nice to be able to add shopping bags without taking up the cargo basket.",1
"Got this to go with the The First Years Ignite Stroller.  As for a Gate Check bag, it worked fine.  The only problem is it isn't quite long enough to completely encapsulate the the Ignite stroller.  The handles had to stick out the bag.Used it to check the stroller 3 times.  No noticeable wear on the bag.  Handle held up to the weight of the stroller.",0
"After a car accident, we had to quickly purchase a new car seat for our toddler. (As in, run to a box store in the middle of the night so we could take her home). What we ended up with was a piece of junk.So I asked friends, did a ton of online research, and landed on the Britax. I love this carseat. We used it rear-facing until my daughter turned 3, and it worked great. We take it on airplanes and use it for travel, and it works great for front-facing as well. The padding is all removable (with some elbow grease) in case of accidents or spills. The seat seems soft and comfortable enough, but the seat is super sturdy and I feel safe riding with my daughter in it.My only complaint is that while the safety latches are easy to attach and release (thank GOD!), it is next to impossible to adjust the straps they're attached to. So while the latches pop out easily, trying to lengthen the straps to get them on a different seat is almost as bad as our other junky car seat. Lots of cursing and sweating usually entail.Also, the tether strap is REALLY long. I understand this is for larger vehicles, but I swear that thing is 7 feet long. It gets a little cumbersome switching the seat out or taking it through an airport with a python of a strap attached. So, it's picky little things that keep me from giving this a perfect rating, but it's really close.",1
"I bought this as a gag holiday gift for someone I know has trouble sleeping. They say it works to help put them to sleep!The """"heartbeat"""" sound is more like a herd of mongrel pigs but the other sounds are realistic.The only downside? Having to take it with you when you travel because you're hooked on it. People really look at you weird in the plane when you're an adult with a sound sheep. Or so I hear.",1
"I bought this car seat for my lil one once he turned 1 and I LOVE IT! The safety features are what I love the most about this car seat.  It is a bit harder to install compared to other car seats but that's what I like because I know it is completely secured in. It is a bit bigger than other car seats but I love it because he is so comfortable and loves it himself.  I would totally recommend this car seat because of the saftey, quality and comfert it provides for my lil one. Its pricey but completly worth it.",1
"I bought this for my baby for the white noise, thinking it would help her sleep but it didn't. She actually did not like the white noise at all but loves the music. Theres a small amount of light that comes through the holes that make a great muted night light. The top light you can turn on is blue and makes a nice, soft glow in the room.",1
"This sling ended up sitting in my closet.  I was afraid to use the sling initially because the pouch is so huge that my daughter disappeared in it and it did not support her enough to keep her in a safe position that wouldn't run the risk of blocking her airway.  I tried the sling again now that my daughter is 15 months old to use as a hip carrier and it is still useless.  I'm 5'2"" and even though I have tightened it as much as I possibly can it does not hold my daughter secure at all.  It is very loose behind her and she could easily fall out if she leaned back.  I would recommend trying this in the store, because it definitely is not one size fits all.",0
"got it when my baby turned 5 month old and started drooling a lot, then realized the bibs have very small neck holes, and after a few washes, the fabrics started tearing apart...",0
"This is our second Boulevard and we love them both.  The seat is no more or less difficult to use than any other brand/model, but it is by far the safest seat made.  That is all that is important to me...that my child is as safe as possible.  My son has never indicated any discomfort or issue with the seat and he has even gone on pretty long road trips.  You can't put a price on safety, so I feel this seat is a great value.",1
"Radians are really great seats and this model delivers all of the features of the other great Radian seats without the high price tag.  Most children can use this seat in the Rear-Facing position from birth (5 lbs) well into the toddler years (45 lbs).  The big selling point over Britax seats is that the Rear-Facing harness slots will accommodate a child 53 inches tall, where the Britax Marathon only goes to 49 inches.  For a toddler, that can equal another year or two in the safest Rear-Facing position.This seat is very narrow, and is ideal for fitting three seats across a small sedan. It is also one of the only seats that can be used in the forward-facing position without the use of the rear tether anchor, making it ideal for trucks and older model cars that may not have a place to clip the anchor.Most vehicle manufactures do not allowed the use of LATCH for children over 45 lbs.  If you are considering a Radian because of the Super Latch feature, be sure to consult your vehicle's owners manual or call the vehicle manufacturer to verify the LATCH limits for your specific make and model vehicle.",1
I am sorry but I have very bad experince with this pump. I've received this pump as a gift and when I came from the hospital with my breast engorged I've decide to give it a try. It worked fine for about 5 minutes than the milk stopped dripping into bottle and filled the top part of the pump and got into the motor. I called customer support for First Years (they are extremely nice and helpful) and they send me mailing label for free return. In five days I've received new replacement pump. That one worked for two days and end up just the same way as the first one. I've called again and they offered me replacement again. I've asked if that is normal with those pumps and I've been told that I am probably producing too much milk(thank God for that:) and this pump is not suitable for me. However they are still replacing it AGAIN! Frustrated enough I called Medela Dealer and I am enjoying my new Pump in Style advanced. If you are serious about breastfeeding for a while don't even bother with those cheap pumps. They are very frustrating. I know that over $ 200.00 may seem a lot but if you consider how much are you saving on formula it's a great investment.,0
These bottles are BPA free and fit the Avent bottle nipples so we were able to move our girls over with out causing any problems.  The lids fit on wierdly though so you need to make sure you have them on the correct grooves or your baby will be covered in milk!,1
These are perfect for our table with sharp corners! We don't worry she will break her head open on a corner anymore. The tape was really hard to get off though and apply.,1
"I bought two of these for our 2 year old and 4 year old, for a trip to Disney world.  I used a thin Sharpie and re-wrote the phone number when it started to fade.  They wore them for a week.  Well my two year old did, and he was the main reason we bought them.  It irritated him at first, but as the day wore on he forgot about it.  Our four year old felt that he was old enough not to wear one, he figured out how to take it off the first day.  I explained what it was for though and insisted that he wear it since he didn't have our phone number memorized. He agreed to wear it, or keep it in his pocket to show to someone if he lost us.",1
This pump was horrible. Didn't feel any suction at all. NOT ONCE! spent 60 bucks for nothing. Don't know why they keep this pump on the market if it does not work. Don't waste your money on this product.,0
"My 16 month old daughter already had a Radio Flyer Tiny Trike, but she didn't like it because her feet kept bumping into the front wheel assembly whenever she tried to scoot. I was really impressed by the videos on youtube of the 3 year old riding this push bike ride-on toy. Initially, 50 dollars seemed like a lot for a chunk of plastic so I looked around for something like it and closest was the Winther Mini Viking Safety Scooter, but the Winther costs $100!The great thing about the SuperMOPI is that it is just about perfect ergonomically for 1.5 year old. It's lightweight, so easy for a toddler to maneuver. The wheels are fast and the steering is incredibly intuitive and responsive, which makes it really fun. I would recommend this toy over any tricycle.",1
"This is th smartest thing on the market.  I buy them for all the new mommies on my list! Durable, comforatable and cute!",1
"Our Walmart never has what you need and I also went to several other stores in our county.  Thankfully, I found these on line.  Great product.",1
"We've used this monitor for 14 months and love it.  The only issue I have is that I didn't buy the one with two parent units.  I would've liked to be able to have one upstairs and one downstairs, instead of always carrying with me.  Love the monitor though.",1
"I really could not sleep at all without this thing - it is really comfortable and big enough for support, but not to take up all the whole bed.",1
Excellent product! Bought it for my 9 month old and he loves to go in and play . Also very easy to set up which I did by myself before my husband got home....Great buy also very affordable!,1
"I took my daughter to a local chain baby store to check out the JJ Cole Bundle Me in the toddler size. My daughter is small for her age (2.5) and there's no way she would have fit in there. I frantically searched online and couldn't find anything long enough (she has special needs and pulls off her shoes and socks - not ideal for winter jogs! I needed something that I could zip her in). I contacted a local stroller strides and another mom recommended the Nomie Baby. I emailed the company and asked for the length and got a prompt reply (39.5"" long). I ordered it and it shipped right away, arriving much sooner than I expected.This stroller blanket is JUST what I wanted. It's fairly lightweight, with enough room inside for me to put another blanket on her if needed. Easy to put into the stroller, very well made, and I love the colors.EDIT: The zipper ended up breaking. I emailed the company both on their website and facebook page - never got a response. The blanket is now useless for it's purpose. I'm extremely disappointed in the customer service.",0
"I bought this pig potty for my 19 month old, who is on the smaller side. While the potty was cute, it was WAY too small for her. Plus there isn't a sanitary way to empty it-you have to dump the whole unit. :(",0
"I was pleased with the quality of the product, but thought it had the surround padding included.  I wanted a generic theme so the bears sufficed.  I was a little amazed at the high pricing for this item considering it was almost the same cost, but slightly lower than retail.",1
Does the job; but the only negative to this item is that the adhesive appears to be a problem to remove once you no longer need the latches.,1
Very cute. Baby really likes. Just wish it played longer. Only winds 4 turns which is not very long at all.,0
"Gift for new grandson: it is sturdy, will be used quite often. Like the product and will brag about new grandson in it quite often.",1
"We bought this a second camera for the handheld monitor + camera. It initially worked but for some reason after a couple of days there was no video, only audio, from this source. No amount of configuring with the two cameras would make this unit work. The company, Healthcheck, gave us grief to no end about returning/exchanging. Not until we gave them a bad review on Amazon.com did they relent. You shouldn't have to go through so much fighting to force customer service!",0
Overall we have been pleased with the portability and features of this stroller for the price.  I was surprised that no one else has mentioned that the stroller's handle is quite low.  Hubby wishes he did not have to hunch over to use this.,1
i recieved this item just a day after it was shipped 2 days after my order and am very satisfied by my customer service,1
Very happy with the Talking Parrot.  My granddaughter loves it.  Well worth the price.  Highly recommend it.  Fast service.  Thanks,1
"Great mattress! Fits perfectly into Graco-on-the-Go. It's a little bit on the thin side, but still works great. If your kid sleeps in this GOG crib quite often I would recommend to get 2 of them, a bit pricey but surely worth it!",1
"Similar to the Beco Butterfly 2 that I have, the shoulder straps are very comfy, baby loves this, it's very cute... My only compliant is That the waist strap is a bit short... It just fits my waist, but it's a bit too tight on my lower back & because of my back condition I can not wear it for as long as I can wear my Beco.",1
"My daughter never liked a bottle so when I weaned her to milk, I went through A LOT of sippy cups trying to find one she likes.  She loves this one! It's a low flow sippy.",1
This was a perfect gift for my great-nephew's baptism.  It is soft and cuddly and plays Jesus Loves Me - so cute!,1
"This is a great product with lots of fun and activities. My 6 months baby enjoys it every time he rides. It makes him busy for 20-30 minutes at max. However, I think it could be improved in certain points:1) Its rotation mechanism is a little bit weak. Many times the chair stops to rotate, or it pups out2) When it is put on a hard floor, the activity station can be pulled by a baby all around the roomOtherwise it is a great fun for the baby and the sibling",1
"I bought my son the turtle and he had no interest.  So, I know he loves anything &#34;cars&#34; and I purchased this for him.  He loves, loves, loves the night light/car, especially because its wheels roll, and the headlights + tail lights work independently of each other while the main light glows and projects stars and lightning bolts.  The downside was it didn't come with instructions, so I thought the batteries ran out and I replaced them but still nothing happened.  Then while my son was pushing around the car, he pushed in one of the tail lights and low and behold, the car lit up!  Make sure you know that besides turning the on switch under the car, to push in the left tail light ifor the car to light up and the right one is the color changer and projector.",1
"I absolutely love this swing! I was looking for an affordable but good quality swing for my newborn. I have the MamaRoo bouncer that stays downstairs in the living/dining room area... And for a couple weeks I was lugging it up and down the stairs in my house & knew I needed something more portable and a swing for my baby upstairs. I researched this swing and saw more positives than negatives. What I love most is that it is PORTABLE! It  folds up quite nicely and is lightweight. I have taken this swing with me visiting the grandparents and even took it with me on a short road trip to a hotel to visit family! It is indeed quiet, and the speed settings and timers are great. SOmetimes I don't even use the timer, and it just keeps swinging. Sometimes I play the music that is provided in the swing, but the music is just OKAY, I would say that is the only negative about the swing... I prefer to play my mix of music for baby boy instead, but if that music is all I have I definitely use it! Thanks Amazon for selling such a great and functional product for parents and babies!",1
This mattress fit perfectly into our crib.  Batteries are easy to get to but screwed in so that small hands cannot get to them. Vibration feature is strong enough to be felt through bedding without shaking the baby too much.,1
"It looked super simple, but alas, it took 2 of us to get it on my toddlers cast. It served it's purpose I suppose, but was over all too short, and far too difficult for a stressed out single mother to figure out. Probably pass next time and stick with garbage bags.",0
"These bottles leak badly no matter what I do!! They started leaking about 6 weeks after I bought them. They leak from the rim. I searched the net for a solution to this problem, tried experimenting with the bottles etc but nothing works. Do not buy these bottles if you hate leaky bottles like I do. I have a hard time producing breast milk and pumping it and it is very hard to see it leak out the side of the bottle. Bottom line don't buy them unless the compANY FIXES THE PROBLEM AS I HAVE REALIZED THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM. ON THEIR WEBSITE THEY TELL YOU 3 REASONS WHY THE BOTTLE MAY LEAK BUT THE LEAKAGE FROM MY BOTTLES IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ANY OF THESE THINGS. THEY NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THEIR BOTTLES!!!",0
I did a TON of research on baby crib mattresses. This was a gift for my first grandchild. The package arrived in record time (with standard shipping). The box and mattress were in great shape after transit. The mattress is exactly as described and is light as a feather. There is no plastic smell (after unwrapping the item). I am very happy with my choice and this item. Love shopping with Amazon too because the price and service can't be beat!,1
Comes with easy to install template.  Great instructions.  I put this gate up in a short amount of time and I like it because there are no footholds for my one year old to climb on like some other gates I've used.  It's easy to open and close and swings in both directions.  A great product!,1
"The bum genius sprayer really thought of all the necessary fixings for an american toilet system. Please note that all parts are delivered for  a T turn off/on valve, lines, sprayer, nozzle and holder for the unit. Great price for all the fixings. We have been cloth diapering for over four years and are very grateful for our new bum genius diaper sprayer",1
"We tried this out yesterday with my son.  He is 5 years old, 45lbs not sure about height but about average.  He wore it fine and even fell asleep on the way home.  I was pleased with the way the vest positioned the seat belt.  He has currently been using a backless booster when traveling and this is so much better.  The seat belt is in the perfect positon on his waist and shoulder at all times even when he fell asleep.  He also found it comfortable enough to wear on the drive which was an hour each way.",1
"We switched from regular disposable diapers to gdiapers a few months ago and we love them. My daughter has very sensitive skin and used to get diaper rashes at the drop of a hat. No more. She used to stick her hands in the legs of her diapers all the time, but she stopped doing that once she started wearing gDiapers. She is so comfortable and cute in these diapers. We use cloth inserts at home and the flushies at daycare. Once I showed her caregivers how to put them on her properly they said it was actually easier than using a disposable. I really love that I can flush the flushies, compost them or throw them away knowing that they will degrade and not fill up a landfill. They are a flexible green alternative to disposables!",1
I love all the toys on this one and the different music options. My twin girls love it too and can be entertained by it for hours. It has plenty of room for both girls and great bright colors. I'm really glad I purchased it has comeand would buy it again as a gift.,1
"I'm only giving it a 4 because it does not fit quite right, and the crib is similar to the one in the picture.  However, it is doing the job for my little baby.  His limbs are safe from getting caught :)",1
This is such a great product... it has the right amount of power to get the job done quickly and easily.  The battery lasts a long time (though it mixes faster with fresh batteries it still does the job even when it starts to slow down).  I can't believe it's priced the way it is.  I've had mine for 6 months and have recently added two more to use for other purposes (like protein shakes and such).,1
"This thermometer is great if you have skiddish kids who dislike regular thermometers. It's a quick scan to the head and you're done. Every time I've taken their temp and then went to the doctor, the results have been the same. Very essential with newborns and movers.",1
"We have 8 month old twins and wanted to buy one chair and try it out before buying the second.  We like this chair, it certainly helps to save space, we haven't had any problems with it at all.  The removable cloth is handy, although it would have been nice if it had a more waterproof finish on it, because it absorbs everything.  The tray is simple to adjust, and the child is easily secured.  We have just ordered the second one and can't wait until we receive it.",1
"My daughter was learning to walk and bath time became impossible.  She wouldn't sit and was constantly flailing about ... too big for the infant tub, but too dangerous for her to be in the tub when she was pulling up and not sitting still.  I found this and bought it at full price (I believe it was upwards of 65 dollars...) but it was the best money I have ever spent. Before I couldn't give her a bath without my husband or someone there to help me, but now i love bath time and it can be me and her alone ... she sits and we have a ball and its safe.  I would recommend whole heartedly.  I would also say it does take a while to get once you order it as I believe it comes from Israel.",1
"For some reason, I was thinking these were larger than they are.  I am used to using Gerber burp cloths, which cover my shoulder with extra hanging down in front and back.  These cloths are basically a little larger than a bathroom washcloth.  I like the patterns, but I don't use that side because it doesn't absorb any liquid.  The terry side on the back of the cloth is perfect for absorbing liquid, but of course part of the reason I liked this cloth was the pattern, which you can't see when you use the terry side.  And since they are a little on the small side, I have had spit up go down my arm and not get trapped by the burp cloth.  Yuck!  But I suppose if you are not burping on the shoulder, they might work better.  Overall three stars since they are well made and functional.",0
"This is a great teething ring.  The part with the gel is really nice and thick so is great for biting to soothe sore gums, especially as my son has gotten a little bigger and his bite is stronger (8 months old).  The other thin teething rings just seem so flimsy like he will bite right through them.  This one is very high quality and stays cool for a while.  Nice bright colors!",1
"My son has loved the swing since he was first born. The lap bar is a little hard to put into place, but once I got used to securing it it is no longer an issue. The motor has a clicking noise, but I find it to be a white noise that helps drown out other sounds while napping. Love that it plugs in, so no batteries are needed.  The two speed vibration mode soothes my son when he is gassy.  Just wish the music could be lowered one more notch.",1
We have a similar blanket from DwellStudio that is in the same color scheme. My daughter loves both blankets. They are very soft and plush!,1
"My son just turned one, and yes, I am now only experiencing the great joy of ""the perfect bag""! I had been using the black bag the hospital gave us when leaving the hospital. It served its purpose, but I definitely felt the need to get a new, more spacious (and of course, stylish) bag. I searched high and low, only to find those falling into the boring or overpriced category. Then one day when picking up a few things at Babies R Us, I happened upon this bag and stopped dead in my tracks. I LOVED it!! But, admittedly, when seeing the price, I waivered on it. Should I or shouldn't I? I must have held it for 15 minutes... and with a shrug of my shoulders, put it back. ""I'll think about it"", I said. Months passed and after even more unsuccessful searches, I decided, ""that's it, I'm buying it!"".  Very excited, with credit card in hand, I jumped online only to find that this bag was SOLD OUT everywhere and that there was a waiting list the size of I don't even know what. I couldn't believe it! Again, I would have to wait...My sister was shopping at Babies R Us the other day, saw it, called me, and within minutes I was there, in line and out the door... with my beautiful new bag! It's been about 2 weeks that I have been using it and I AM IN LOVE!!!Do not hesitate! The price my seem high at first, but really, it's a beautifuly, incredibly function, high quality bag. It holds all the necessities - for the both of us. I am no longer juggling multiple bags - a diaper bag for him and a purse for myself. Initially I was concerned that there was not a shoulder strap option, but it's not an issue. It fits so comfortably over my shoulder and nestles right under my arm... it doesn't slide - at all! And, most of all, this bag is all glam... it's gorgeous, feminine... a real looker! You've got to get it :)One final word if you're on the fence. If you hate heavy bags, this is probably not the one for you. When filled to capacity, it does get a bit heavy, BUT (yes, there is a but) it's nothing you can't handle. I still give this bag 5-Stars... it's amazing!!!!Alas, my search is over... thank you Wendy!!!",1
"Quality is very sturdy and it doesn't scratch our door. As soon as I drink more bottles of wine, I am getting another.",1
"I ordered 2 carseats for my twin grandsons.  They still have to ride rear facing since they are not 2 yet.  The car seats are very nice and I really like how they adjust seating positions.  Only con is if you have a small car, the seats are kinda big and you won't be able to recline or adjust the seat in front of the car seat.  We have a van so it's not a problem for us. They were easy (as easy as car seats can be) to install. When the babies are forward facing it will be much better. The babies like the seats so much better than their other ones. I like how easy they are to adjust the harness and tightness. It could have a little more padding on the headrest, but it is fine. Overall I like these seats.",1
I acquired this monitor in order to stay aware of the needs of a family member struggling with illness. I took it with me when I went throughout the house or on the porch so that I could remain vigilant. It captured sounds beautifully and the volume control allowed me to make choices about the level of vigilance required at given times. I recommend this Audio Monitor without reservation.,1
"Fabulous option for two children of different ages! We are expecting a second baby any day and we spent the past few months researching double strollers. We had almost settled on the City Mini Double but then saw the City Select and immediately knew it was the right option for us. Our son is currently 22 months and he will be in daycare a few days a week so I will be home with just the baby most of the time, but we will need a double stroller when we have the 2 together. The City Select is the only one that eliminates the need for two strollers (a single and a double) on different days. It has lots of options on how we can use it (car seat, bassinet, facing front or back, etc), and handles really well. In reality, it's only 2lbs heavier than the City Mini Double and a whole lot thinner. We've used the stroller as a single so far, but also as a double with our son and one of his toddler friends and it's easy to maneuver, easy to get the different pieces in and out, and feels only marginally heavier to push up the giant hill he live on than our City Mini Single. My only complaint is that everything you need is sold separately: the second sit kit, the bassinet, the car seat adaptor, the rain covers, etc, so that drives up the price of the complete system considerably.",1
"Worked great for a few days, then started developing quirks - like it would get stuck on one sound or wouldn't turn on right away.  The iPod plug in never worked.Used if for a few weeks at night in baby's room, he slept to the white noise.  At three weeks it got stuck on - could not turn it off and then it died.  Completely dead.  Piece of junk!Tried to return to amazon.com - but they said it had been too long since purchase.  NO REFUND!!!!Read a bunch of other reviews and this happens a lot.  It's a defective product and the manufacturer knows it.  BUYER BEWARE.You should not have to purchase a new baby sound machine every month!  I'm going to try the Ecotones and the Marpac - both of which have way better reviews even though they're more expensive.  BUT since I've been using a fan for about ten years - it's worth the investment to me.I hope I can save some others from a faulty purchase and waste of money.",0
Don't break when kids pull things out of closet.,1
Suction cups hold our net up even when it's at full capacity.  We have a tiny bathroom so this is extremely helpful with containing our boys bath toys.  I'd give it 5/5 but it's nice the largest net ever so if you have rather large bath toys I wouldn't expect to get away with buying just one of these.,1
"These are just a basic bottle, they did come with packaging that said Medela on them.  I bought these to transport my breastmilk to and from daycare without having to buy a bunch of bags.  I also bought the medela lids that can be marked with the day of the week to go with them.  I did notice that the measurements are not quite accurate, but I am not actually using these bottles to feed my baby from.",0
"I have two packs of these and love them.  No piling, no shrinking, super soft! I love that we have given up disposable wipes and these are a great alternative.",1
"Just receieved this last night. Took only a few minutes to assemble. I got it for my new grand daughter . She is only three months old and loves to be rocked. the only disappointment was that I thought it looked green,. However, when it arrieved the color is beige. It does match well anyway. It is extremly comfortable. She has already been rocked to sleep. I hope it holds up well . Im looking forward to putting it to the test of time.After having this a few months I change my mind. The cushions and seat support do not hold up. Also, one of the arms comes loose and must be jarred back into place. Too bad. I would not recommend this.",0
We found this an awesome option for our trips to the beach. Much better then stopping somewhere and asking them to heat up the bottle in their microwave. Although this NOT for playtex bottles unfortunately. But for glass or plastic bottles it work awesome! Takes a good 10 minutes to warm the bottle but awesome (have I said that word enough?) to quiet a hungry baby!,1
We bought this a week ago and set it up as a 12 foot wide fence to keep the dogs out of the garden.It took a couple of times of opening the gate to get used to opening it.,1
"Very pleased with this product.  It was larger than I expected, which was great since my grandson has a lot ofstuffed animals that are now off of his bed.  I love it.",1
I own 2 of these and have purchased as gifts.  One I have had for several years and it is still going strong.,1
"I was a bit wary of buying this pillow after reading the previous reviews. But I'm actually very pleased with the Balboa Baby pillow! I'm short but have a long waist, and the Boppy just isn't tall or firm enough to support my baby close to my breast. After a few weeks of sore arms and shoulders, I stumbled on this pillow. It's almost perfect - the foam is very firm and supportive, and the shape of the pillow makes it useful for the football hold as well as the cradle hold. I do wish that the bottom of the pillow was flat, since that would make it more stable on my lap. It's quite pricey for what it is, but if it helps me nurse my baby more comfortably, it's worth it!",1
what should I said? My life saver!!!I couldn't point any unsatisfied about it!! My baby loves it! And easy to wear it for both my huasband and me! six stars for this carrier!,1
We bought the gate to bring to tailgates so we could mark off a section for my 9 month old son. It worked as expected but when we try to use it in the house it is very easy for him to move around. I tried to use it to block off door ways into rooms and my son is just about to push it around or move it out of his way.I think when its all linked together its stronger but using it as a gate unlinked doesn't really work.,0
"This wet bag does it's job - it holds at least one day's worth of cloth diapers and contains the smell. Also, it's cute.However, one of the images on the project page highlights the features of the bag, and says that it is machine washable and dryable. The packaging indicates that the bag should air dry, which I expected, as my other wet bags are not dryer-friendly. My gripe with this wet bag is that it takes a couple days to air dry all the way. My other bags of a different brand air dry overnight. Thankfully I only need to use this bag one or two days a week, so I can let it dry for several days.",0
My new little grandson or granddaughter will just love using these. One of the nicest around. I am glad I ordered this.,1
"it'a very beautiful product. a good product for my baby I think, he like the color although he cannot use it.",1
I would highly recommend this toy net as a great buy. My grandson just loves to put his toys in it.,1
"It is always difficult getting a reading from a thermometer for a sick infant. With this product, given that the infant would be used to a pacifer, works wonders. For all of my friends expecting a little one, this is a must.",1
"My daughter is 7 months old and this is the only product I have ever felt compelled to review.  I purchased this exersaucer to use at our vacation home and at grandmom's house.  I felt uneasy putting my baby in this from the start.  Not quality. It is terrible!  If you look at the picture closely the seal, the rocking horse and elephant all have protrusions on them. They are like little hammers, the plastic on them is really hard!  My daughter pushed on the seal and it bounced back and whacked her in the head. It caused a huge bump and tears! To be safe, we removed all of them.  The only thing left on this for her to play with is a soft lion that she can teethe and a rattle. I could have bought both for under $10.00!  The carousel spinner plays stupid music and blinks a single red light that barely attracts her attention.  I am leery of the carousel also, since the plastic on this is really hard too.  It seems to have the potential to injure her as well.  THIS IS JUST JUNK!  I have reported what happened to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.  The idea of this folding is wonderful and one of the reasons for the purchase, but everytime we try to fold it up, the legs fall off and the springs pop out.  The food tray is useless. (Who feeds their child in the middle of playing?) The space this takes up could be much better utilized with another toy.  I have a Baby Einstein exersaucer at home and it is so much better, safer and much more entertaining.  Spend $10-20 more, it is worth it!  I am taking this back to the store tonight!",0
"We have really used and liked this item constantly since our daughter was born.  We never take the changing table down and she sleeps in the bassinet on the other side. Haven't used the play mat yet.Pros: Very attractive, relatively easy to set up, nice storage bag, pleasant music, very soft and washable bassinet coverCons: Not great storage for wipes, the vibrator doesn't actually move the bassinetI would buy it again.",1
I have tried a few brands and a few solutions (like using regular washcloths). These are perfect. They are double layered and I can get the worst poop messes all cleaned up with no issues with these. I have only had to use more than one wipe on 3 occasions and I now have a 3 year old and a 1 year old.,1
"I was originally using the medela brand bra, but this is so much better.  I was able to adjust the size and it fits well over my nursing bra.",1
"We got this changing table based on other reviews and are glad that we did. I will say that putting it together was a nightmare...but that's our only complaint. The directions were AWFUL and there were about a million pieces, but they were all there once you figured out where everything fit together. Whoever wrote the review that says the changing table itself is poor quality was SO off base!My husband says this is the most sturdy, high-quality piece of put-it-together-yourself furniture he's ever seen. It is solid, well-made and expensive looking. The drawer mechanisms are actually metal and they slide very smoothly. The changing table top is designed to be easily put on and off with a couple of screws, so if you decide you don't want it (and just want to use the dresser without it) it is easy and nice looking.This is a NICE dresser and changing table and I recommend it!",1
"It was perfect for an infant, but flimsy. Not a substitute for a pack n play or tent... Okay for a newborn in the shade or inside... Not appropriate for movers, or in the sun.",1
"I love this product! I like that it has a case that's easily washable and holds up well. I just pack it up and put it in the diaper bag. We've had previous issues where the forks are not sharp enough, and our daugher has a hard time feeding herself because of that, but these are just right. Not sharp enough where we worry about her hurting herself, but sharp enough to pierce things, like vegetables, pasta, etc. The spoon is slightly wider than her other spoons, but she took to it well and has no problems.",1
"I would rather have a plastic chain link versus this cloth strap, but it works just fine.The cloth strap needs to be washed everyday otherwise it will smell. I am big on smells and prefer a plastic chain, but I cannot find one. So this one will do. It stays clasped to his clothes for the most part. I removed the penguin guy and wrap the strap into the soothie pacifier. The little character device does NOT hold the pacifer at all. Just make the adjustment and it is all good.",1
"The design is cute, and the color is bright and refreshing. It's also very easy to use.I got this for my daughter. Both of us are happy with this purchase.",1
"This chair is great.  Came packaged really well, easy to put together - Solid. So solid that I couldn't get the footrest in.  I takes some muscle and patience since after putting the thing together; once the things are tightened it's near impossible to put the footrest in.  I went back and loosened each side up but was somewhat reluctant to loosen then tighten the bolt for fear of stripping them - either way thru more use we are now able to get the footrest in.One other thing, the cushion on back works well.  So does the lap belt; however the lap belt used in conjunction with the bottom cushion doesn't work efficiently.  Even with the belt; when our son goes stiff like a board to try and get out - this action causes the cushion to slide forward and out of place - a minor hassle.",1
"So much thicker and good quality. Fit the older bassinets perfectly.I like how it rounds in the corners, not square.",1
"This pump works great. I use it at home when I need to do a quick pump. I also have the Medela in Style for work, but don't always want to set that all up at home. This was money well spent. Works quickly and easily.",1
I bought this based on looks recomendations and description. What I got was a glorified pack n play bassinet type thing. The only difference is the side is down on one side to allow you to roll over and pat your baby. I was expecting an extension essentially to my bed with both mine and the baby's matress at the same height this is not so. So I still have to pull her out of her bed abd put her in mine to nurse and then wake her up to put her back in. Plus I have a 4 poster bed with rails down each side at the base of my matress so the sleeper does not push up flush to the bed as it said they should warn about this.,0
"These are a MUST HAVe for us.  We travel a LOT and when we're on the road, not having to mess with scooping and measuring is HUGE.  Ours is mis-matched though with a purple lid and a pink bottom, NOT as pictured. It does its job and does it well, though.",1
"I have this seat for my 3 month old, and he loves it.  He has used it since he came home from the hospital, both with the mobile and vibration on and without.  He is a very long baby (25 inches), but the seat is plenty big enough for him.  The bouncing motion is gentle, but he can still make it bounce by itself when he kicks or moves his body.  The adjustable reclining height made it work well for him when he was born and had little head control since he could recline more. Now that he can hold his head steady, we adjusted the height so he can sit up in it more and look around.  He needs to be upright after eating due to acid reflux, and this seat allows him to do that comfortably.  I originally chose it because of the softness of the fabric, as it is by far the softest material on an infant bouncer I've ever seen.  So many bouncers have coarse thin fabric that doesn't really support babies but allows them to slump over when they are very young - this one has soft thick padding that supports their bodies and just feels good to the touch.  It has worked well for us, and I would definitely recommend it to my friends.",1
"It's not expensive, that's the point. It's not cheap either. Padding is thick and comfortable exactly where you need it. Gliding mechanism is smooth and has a nice range of motion.It's hard buying things sight unseen but it's equivalent to the Dutalier one's they sell for $600 at the other places that have a brick and mortar storefront that you have to wait for 8-12 weeks to get (baby is here by then dummies!) Craftsman from the old country don't need to make these things, it just needs to glide well and be super comfortable for mom and baby for a few years, this does that perfectly.Very easy to put together, 8 ikea style screws and you are gliding away into bliss town.It doesn't recline and it doesn't make pancakes or waffles or save you money on car insurance but it's a glider. It glides well, it looks nice, the padding is great and it's comfortable, and it's under $200 for both the glider and the ottoman. Will last through the next few kids and that's all that these things are needed for.",1
"I tried several other tubs before we landed on this one. The reclined infant seat is fantastic and allows baby to relax while he enjoys his bath.  There's plenty of room for him to splash and play.  I use the tub on my bathroom countertop next to the sink.  When we're finished with the bath, I just lift up one end and pour the water into the sink.  It's easier than using the drainage plug.  I've given this tub as a gift to all the new Mommies I know!  I'd definitely put it on my &quot;must have&quot; list for a new baby!",1
"Just like all the other reviews have said, this bath may does not stick to the tub.  It floats.  I tried everything to make it stick to no avail.  This product is crap!",0
"We've been using this seat for 8 months now, and its held up very well.We did a LOT of research, since this will be in use for many years.I think we made the right choice.The style is versatile - looks great in my car as well as my wife's car.Graco's solid reputation is well earned; the quality of all components are exceptional.",1
This is a great toy!  It's a ball shape with subtle details of an bird.  It makes a nice jingle sound when it moves and is just cute.  My 7month old loves its and has gnawed on anything he can get into his mouth and this thing shows no signs of wear.  It's also survived older brothers using it as a ball and subjecting it to some roughhousing without any issues.  There is some conflicting info on the box vs tag on wash-ability but I can say mine has been though the washer and dryer several times now without incident; a key point for a kids toy.,1
Love those lights. I only bought two but will order more. The light comes on only when in dark. It is great. We have been using them for few months now. There are Oslo not too bright just perfect.,1
This product is great in theory but really isn't very useful in the real world. It is a pain to put in and really is not that sturdy. I wouldn't suggest this purchase.,0
"This froggie spout guard I ordered from Amazon, com. relieves my mind that my grandchildren won't scrape their backs on the tub facuet.  It works well and stays in place even when the water is flowing through it.",1
"This toy is the most versatile gift our little girl has received!  There are plush links and rings, balls that rattle when shaken, music that plays when the balls are dropped into the ""bong"" (as my husband calls it), and so many different uses for all of these components.  Our daughter, who just turned one, has been playing with this since she was five months old.  Then, she really only was able to pick up the links and rings and shake the balls.  Later, she started using the links and rings as hats with her Grammy, pulling them off of Grammy's head and later attempting to put a ""hat"" on herself.  She has since banged the balls together, holding one in each hand, figured out how to carry the rings on her wrists, taught herself how to open the Velcro on the links, and now she's dropping the balls into the bong all by herself.  This was sent by one of my husband's friends- unmarried and without children- and I applaud him or whomever gave him the recommendation to purchase this wonderful learning tool for our little girl.  Go get one for your little one!",1
I love these! They actually dont leak!!!  They have something in the straw that make it not leak. If fits up to 8 oz max. Love them and worth the money!!,1
"I have the Olivia cover, which I used with my first baby and now I'm using it with my second. It is such a great product for such a great price!!! The fabric is perfect...light-weight enough to keep you and baby from over-heating. I definitely wouldn't want the fabric to be any thicker! I also just love the pattern--very stylish. In fact, I think all of the patterns are super-cute! I highly recommend this product to ALL breastfeeding moms!!! You can tell this was created by an experienced mother!!!",1
"Great value, cute design. My daughter loves this set for her lunchbox. I just hand wash the napkin and sandwich/snack holder everyday after school & they're dry in the morning before I pack her lunch again. So far, so good! Feel good about not wasting plastic and paper everyday - she goes to a montessori school so the teachers told my daughter to ask me to pack reusable napkins and baggies. I'm glad I did :)",1
"The trimmer is nice and sharp, inexpensive, and gets the job done.  The magnifying glass is difficult to use, unless you have a totally limp baby.  The anti-slip rubber is a nice touch, since I have sent clippers flying before, and I certainly don't want clippers flying at my baby's face.",1
Cute cups that don't spill.  It would be nice if they came with an extra valve since the valve is hard to clean and easy to lose.,1
"I ordered this diaper pail because I just love Charlie Banana OS cloth diapers. I used it straight out of the box and the first poopy diaper I had to rinse leaked right through this diaper pail. The zipper is on the bottom of mine (which doesn't make much sense) and the water came right through it in the corner. If the zipper were not on the bottom, I'm sure it would work just fine. Thank you Figure 8 Maternity for giving me a full refund! I ordered a few Planet Wise pail liners to put down in a trash can instead.",0
"We bought this ink when we couldn't find any no mess pads like they have at the hospital. I still would have preferred the no mess ones, but this washed off prettying easily and got the job done.",1
"This puzzle was for my 3year old niece. It is basically a great game for any child learning the alphabet. The outer loop of puzzle pieces is made up of 26 different people with occupations corresponding to the alphabet, and inside this loop are the pieces to a tiny detailed little town with buildings that correspond to the occupations.",1
i love that this has a lifetime warranty!!! very soft and durable. I would purchase this again. my baby is a stomach sleeper and its nice knowing she can still breathe if she falls face forward,1
I purchased this for my car which is a Jetta and this fits perfectly and protects the bottom and back of the leather seats. It even has a place cut out for the car seat locks to attach to the metal hooks on the car and also hides them. The storage compartment on the front is very useful and i like that this covers the entire car seat we have which is a Chicco. The car seat does not slide at all when sitting on this mat. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with leather seats.,1
"I have 2 of these gates, I've owned one for 2 years now for the top of the stairs, and I just purchased a second one about 3 months ago for the bottom.. they are sturdy and of great quality and very easy to operate,  for an adult of course, hard for the kids.. The installation is a little tricky, but once the gate if put in place, it works wonderfully, and definitely keeps the babies out of trouble..",1
"I bought some of these when the grandson was born. I gave two to my daughter in law, and kept one for my house. I do wish I could find some of these slightly bigger, but they have served their purpose well. Mine has held up well despite numerous washes over the last 6 mo.",1
I am an exclusive pumper.  I use this 4 or 5 times a day and let me tell you it changed my life.  I get that 2 hours a day back.  IT is comfortable enough to wear throughout the day (although I take it off and put it on when I need to pump and wear a real bra) and it is super convenient.  This was a great purchase for me!,1
"Love it.  No cloth parts so it can be wiped clean or washed with soap.  Adjustable back for different height kids.  Three point harness is part of the adjustable back, so once kids are big enough not to need the brown back, they usually don't need the harness.  Adjustable straps attach to the seat of the chair and the back of the chair.",1
My little girl loves her play suite and is really enjoying play time . Great purchase for our sitter since we don't have bassinet for her house.,1
"This little photo album with the lacy pink dress on it was absolutely perfect for the new baby in the family. It is a very inexpensive , well-made article and I think it was just precious!",1
"Freshfoods Mash & Serve Bowl  is so good ,clear,easy to sever for baby so many friends love it ,thank you so much!!!",1
"We love this gate. Not only does it work great, but it also looks great! Everyone who comes over loves this gate!",1
"The lamb is sweet and soft, and the music was fine until the spring broke! Really Gund?!!! Shame on poor your quality. I have my children's Gund stuffed animals with music boxes that are 30 years old and still working, but the one I gave my baby granddaughter for her christening is already junk! I expected better from Gund and for that price!",0
Great quality.  Keeps odors contained.  Easy to wash and quick to dry . Will order another.  Just wish there were more patterns and colors.,1
This bean bag chair is tiny. It might be good for a 4-5 yr. old and that is it. Plus it took 3 weeks for delivery. It is filled maybe half way so if you order this(why) order more fill for it.,0
"We have tried a couple of Raw Shea Butter products and we have liked them all so far, this one is just smoother and easier to apply with little to no work in getting it to dissolve.  Arrived quickly and without issues",1
"After spending a lot of time looking for a crib for our first child, I finally decided to roll the dice and get this one without seeing it in person. It looks pretty identical to the Pottery Barn Kids Kendall crib, but for about half the price.It shipped sooner than expected and was very easy to assemble. We did notice a slight odor as other reviews have mentioned, but the smell seemed to be coming from the packaging rather than the crib itself. We bought it well in advance of our baby's arrival, so we just left the window open over night and it was no big deal.The main reason I bought this crib was for its height. My husband and I are both tall and I was concerned about having to bend really far with a shorter crib. Just be aware that the height is measured at the highest point (the head and foot of the crib) rather than the side railing, which is about 5"" shorter than the height listed in the description. In hindsight, this makes complete sense, but it didn't occur to me since I did not see it in person.Other than that, it is very sturdy. Our baby isn't due until August, so time will tell how this crib will hold up, but for the price, we will have gotten out moneys worth of it only lasts through one kid!",1
"We LOVE robots so I knew when I saw this I had to have it.  I had a ten dollar off coupon, but even at only twenty dollars this towel is overpriced.  The towel itself is thin, not plush and upon washing this for the first time (and yes I followed the instructions) the black cording on the on/off switch of the tail came apart and now is frayed and ugly.  I will be returning this and hopefully they will return my coupon also so I can use it on something better.  You would expect this of a ten dollar and under towel, but not for this price.  What a hassle!",0
"Chair cover is NOT cotton, but is a flimsy polyester.  Padding on chair is minimal and there are no screw holes to attach the rockers. (Instructions say these holes are pre-drilled.)  Will keep the chair because the price was great and it's for my grandson who live far away so it won't get used much.",0
"I have a little girl with special needs and allergies.  I Have to have a good pump.  She relies on it.  I rely on it.The Avent Isis Duo IQ is Much more comfortable to use then the Medela pumps.  It is more durable then the Ameda for multiple times a day use.  I find it easier to clean then the Medela because I don't have to force off the yellow part every time.  My favorite part is the absolute control over speed and pressure.  I can make it go as fast/slow/hard/soft as I want just by ""showing"" it what I want.  I could never get it quite right on the others.  I can mimic the fast and light beginning sucks and then the deeper slower ones after let down.Avent stands behind their product.  My motor went out after several months of daily/nightly use.  I called their customer service and they quickly and easily replaced it for me.  Thank you!  I wasn't pleased that it went out, but there is always that risk with anything electronic.  I was glad to deal with a good company.",1
This gadget keeps my son out of the broiler portion of my oven (separate door below the oven) - so I'm happy with it.  It would be better if it were flatter because I can't open the upper oven door all the way since this has been installed.,1
I bought this on mothersday and excited but it having some damage inside and some tears so we are not comfortable with purchase. thought graco is good for this price.,0
"While this chair works fine, it's just not comfortable.  My son's little bottom is so red after just sitting on it for a short time!  He ends up either standing for some relief or moving around the chair in an attempt to find a comfortable position.  If I had to do it over again, I would buy something with a cushy seat.  Wouldn't buy this one again...",0
Use it every day in at least 2 places in my home. They have held up well against the door slamming / fighting.,1
Good monitor! Works well and had no problems with set up! Price when I bought it was good too compared to other places!,1
"I absolutely love this infant seat.  The music is so sweet and pleasant to listen to, unlike most of the other baby products that have a more annoying electronic sound to them.  The plush seat is soft and comfy, and my daughter has enjoyed this since she was about a week old. Some people complain that it doesn't do enough, but that is what I like about it.  This infant seat is meant to be soothing --she can relax in this chair.  (I bought the Flutterby Bouncer as an alternative for when she wants more stimulation -- it's cute and relatively inexpensive.)  I highly recommend the baby papasan -- I wish they would make one for me.",1
"My five month old daughter enjoys this toy immensely.  The crinkly crab is her favorite creature, followed by the jingly fish.  She also really likes the bowl itself.  I can already see her trying to figure out how to grab the toys through the plastic, which she can't.  I then get to show her how to take the toys out of the top.  This will surely help her develop her concepts of in and out.  Right now she quite adeptly empties the toys out of the bowl by dumping it upside down over her head, which is fine because the creatures are soft and light!",1
"I bought this after reading several other good reviews here on Amazon about it and I'm really glad I did. It was so cheap but it's good quality and fits on all our strollers. One of our strollers doesn't have any sort of parent caddy so I stopped using it until we got this. I need somewhere for my drink to go and other little odds and ends like keys and cell phone so they are handy. This works great!! It velcros on very securely. I highly recommend this, and you can't beat the price!",1
"I'm writing this review almost 2 years after my initial purchase - my son is now 20 months old and no longer fits the swing but when he did fit, it was perfect.  I do a lot of sewing and I kept him on my table next to me while I did my work.Would absolutely recommend this swing.",1
"We had another car seat for our granddaughter, but she was able to open the &#34;latches&#34; around her chest. She is not able to do that with this car seat.",1
"Cleans easily, travels easily. It was a great transition from high-chair to big table. My son calls it his big-boy chair.",1
"This stroller is definitely worth the money especially for twins. My twins are 14 months old. I was given this stroller from Kolcraft to try out with my twins and asked to give my honest opinions so here goes.Pros:1. Major Versatility in positions that the kids can sit. For me this is great. The twins love facing each other, but if one starts getting crabby and fighting, then I can always change the seating arrangement.2. Stylish. I love the look of the stroller. It is a very sleek look. It makes you feel like one of those trendy moms with a bugaboo.3. Full seat recline. This is huge for me. I have several other tandems and this is the only one that I have found with dual full reclining seats. This is a great design for people with twins especially because both kids are still young enough to sleep while out.4. Infant car seat friendly. My twins are no longer in infant seats, but if they were this stroller would be ideal. With the purchase of an additional car seat adapter (only 1 is included)this stroller can be transformed into a double snap n go which is a lifesaver for all new twin moms in the beginning. So it essential eliminates the need to buy 2 strollers. This stroller grows with the children.5. Great Maneuverability. This is my #1 quality. I have yet to find a tandem that pushes and turns well until now. This one is great. That is huge to me.Now sadly we move on to the cons.Cons:1. HEAVY. This stroller is ridiculously heavy. It takes some real muscle to get it in and out of the car. My twins feel lighter at a combined weight of 40lbs.2. Folding. Although it is easy to fold, I absolutely hate that you have to take a seat off to fold it down easily. It is not hard, but it is a nuisance.3. Leg Room when facing is inadequate.4. Leg rests are not long enough to allow for growth. My twins are only 30"" which is short for 14 months and they only have about 2-3 in to the bottom5. No snack tray/cup holders for the kids.Overall for me the pros outweigh the cons for the money. I actually wish that I had this stroller sooner. I would definitely stuck with it over the other 4 I have. I hope this helps.",1
"This was even better than I expected.  We have an elongated toilet in my son's bathroom and I was always having problems with potty seats not staying put while he was sitting on them.  Needless to say, he had some anxiety about sitting on the big potty after that.  I ordered this seat and it is absolutely fabulous!  The seat was easy to install and is very easy to use for both children and adults.  The best fringe benefit is that the seat closes slowly so it doesn't slam!  That should be a selling point in bold letters.  I recommend this product for anyone in a household with potty training children.  It works beautifully!",1
A PREMIUM PRODUCT AND ENJOYED BY OUR GRANDCHILDREN -- APPEARS SAFE AND SHOULD LAST YEARS AS OTHER GRANDCHILDREN COME OUR WAY -- ANOTHER GOOD AMAZON EXPERIENCE,1
"I like this mobile. Yeah, its a little expensive for the product, but it matches the rest of the Forest Friends bedding. The directions weren't great, but I figured it out pretty quick. It seems like it will fit most cribs. After it was put together, I think it looks really cute. I haven't used it long to know how long it will last. Overall, I really like it and I'm glad I got it at my baby shower.",1
These are super easy to use and install but the adhesive is not very strong.  We bought two and only one is really holding up,0
"Not only can i see my twins clearly as it changes back and forth between them it has a great rainbow nightlight on the camera above their beds. ( they love the rainbows)  I can constantly hear what goes on in the room and the battery life and range are great!  I've tried several other type of video monitors with all the bells and whistles. (including room temp and speaker system to talk to your baby.) Nothing beats  this practical, easy to operate, long lasting monitor with a great screen to view the child.  I've had  monitors where you just can't make out the picture on the screen and this one has excellent visibility. Also you can add another camera at anytime. I Love it! I would definentely buy another one.",1
"This products EATS batteries &amp; does skip sometimes, BUT it is very convenient &amp; is helpful at naptime!",0
I loved the item.  It was a gift though and I hope the mommy and daddy agree.  To be determined...,1
"I bought this stroller in September; by November the security straps could no longer close around my 32&#34; / 23 lb baby wearing a winter jacket.  The crotch strap only has one position, leaving a only few inches between its base and the seat back - you can't adjust it further out as the baby grows - which is just not enough space to be comfortable for my little man.  Then even with the shoulder and crotch straps fully extended, we cannot close them around the baby wearing a jacket.  I called Bugaboo and they said there was nothing they could do; no strap extensions, nothing.  She said they get a number of similar complaint calls at this time of year from the colder climates where the babies are wearing jackets, but not enough for them to make any design changes to the item.  So here I am with $900 worth of stroller (with additional canopies and accessories etc) that I used for about three months.The other major design flaw is that the recline has only three positions - straight up, 90 degrees and fully horizontal.  For the price, one would expect more options.  Between being squeezed by the straps and laying in awkward angles, my baby never looked comfortable in this stroller.Lastly, I find the stroller extremely difficult to open and close.This was a purchase that I greatly regret.",0
"We have both brands of these """"snack traps.""""  I like the Munchkin the best because they are bigger and the lids seem to hold up better.  The lids on the other brand tend to cave in after many uses.  The Munchkin have held up better.",1
"I looked at reviews and information about a LOT of travel potty seats before deciding on this one. I have no regrets about buying this seat.  It folds nicely.  It has never pinched the little one's behind, though the negative reviews I read had/have me worried about it. I have not had problems with it not fitting on certain toilets. We have used it in hotels and it does fine.",1
"I am pleased with this product. The only con is that the bottom ""stoppers"" fall off. I guess you could glue them on. I think we have lost all of them. My 7 month old loves this seat. The toys grab her attention and keep it. She stays occupied. I like that the tray comes off and you can use it as a seat. I love that it has a 3 point harness. The orange cushion comes out so it can be used for bigger kids as a booster, too. Great price, great product.",1
"I got this along with the Lady bug for my little niece and nephew, Wow, did they love it. They kept taking everyone into the bathroom, to turn off the light to ""see the stars and moon""  Highly recommend it!!  Still getting reports of how much they love it at bedtime!",1
Finally!  A baby monitor that works without interference.  I even place my cell phone right next to it at night and it still works properly!  The sensitivity and volume can both be adjusted and being able to tell my baby that I am coming is nice.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend.,1
"Easy to use, easy to clean.  What more could you ask for?  Great bottles for my newborn.  I bought the 4 oz size, and my newborn eats so much that I imagine they won't last too long - but quality is great.",1
"No smell, organic cotton. it gives some cushion for the baby's crib but it is not too soft that you need to worry about Sid.",1
I gifted this to my cousin who recently became a mother all over again and everybody said its very cute and lovely. The colors are bright and catches the baby's eyes :),1
It was a gift and the mother loves the  softness of the organic cotton fabric because it is soft and gentle on the baby`s skin.,1
It is a bit difficult to pull out once in the socket but I think I like it that way.  My 15 mos old tries to pull it out and can't. Works for me!,1
This item arrived as described and came in a nice kit.  Then only problem was it was cumbersome and not as strong as I needed.  It was actually cheaper to rent a hospital grade machine which was more efficient.  I returned this product,0
"I had tried a couple of different similar products, but this one is so sturdy and folds down flat. It is perfect for travel or taking with you whenever you are out and about. It installs very quickly and I feel comfortable with my 1 year old in it,",1
"I bough two. One foe my son and one for my daughter. My son's had a loose hand when we got it out, my husband was able to fix it. My daughter's stopped working after two days.",0
very useful and easy freezer tray. This is the second time that I buy it.......great!!! I love it!! 5 stars,1
My wife swears by this thing.  Cannot think of anything wrong with it.Works well and used 3 times a day.,1
"I thought that I would love this sterilizer, the concept is great. However, after a few uses the bottom has burned and is burning the plastic. Pretty expensive item and might not be usable soon. I have made sure to use the correct amount of water and made sure the sterilizer is level. I don't recommend this product.",0
"I bought two of the JJ Cole Essential Blankets. I like the waterproof underside it's thick, and works great in the sand. It also has a strap, and a little pocket. The top is soft and it stays cooler than the fleece blankets. I have a family of three and two blankets together fit us just right. Took the blankets to the beach, even when the blankets got a little wet, the sand still rolled right off. Took it to a concert in the park and it kept us off the wet grass. Absolutely no leaking through. It's very easy to roll back up and put away. Great Product.",1
This item is very cute. Perfect for my 8 Yr old daughter's room. It is a little smaller then I expected and doesn't put out much light. We replaced her ceiling light with it but It can be plugged in to an outlet in the corner and hung as an accent light. Probably better if it isn't the main light but she loves it and it looks great in her &#34;Paris&#34; themed room.,1
"The spout is too big. I really wanted to like this bottle, ( i bought two) and tried it several times with my seven month old son. It always ended in lots of tears. They are really cute. I love the measurement on the side and the handles but my son did not like the large spout. So I went back to the Boon sippy cup which I used with my first two children, all is good.",0
Love this bag! It's the perfect size & has a lot of pockets to store things. I like the handles that offers the option of holding on your shoulder like a purse or the extra strap that allows you to wear it cross body. The pattern is super cute too!!,1
"I am a stroller junkie and my husband will tell you that the last thing that we needed was another stroller!  I needed something for an upcoming Disney trip that would accomodate my 3 year old and I was not satisfied with the umbrella strollers out there.  This is just the thing!  She can hop in and out as needed, but I also love the option to recline if she should happen to fall asleep.  I have been using this around town with my 9 month old and I will now make this my ""go to"" stroller.  It folds up very compact and is effortless to maneuver.  After using it himself, my husband now sees why I needed another!!",1
"This product will be great in the fall and spring when I want to block bugs and wind, but here it is 100 degrees and up in the summer and there is very little if any air circulation. The mesh is very thick and the baby cannot see through it very well either. I recommend going with a thin mesh from a local store and a ray shade if you live in a hot climate.",0
Very easy to fold up and well worth the money. We have a bigger stroller but this smaller one is just the thing for shorter trips and is very compact.,1
"I love this set and the price is unbeatable for two items. The potty seat is soft and colorful, fits well over the toilet seat. The side handles offers extra support for our son. It's extremely light weighted so you can take it with you as needed. The stepping stool is awesome too. Like the seat, it is bright and cheery. It's durable and strong and helps my son to reach whatever he wants to.",1
been using it for six months straight .. it works great and it is very gentle on the breat ... thanks,1
"1st I will start by stating the negative.  I ordered the Natural color, the box stated natural however; it was definitely Honey-Oak.  Since this was for my grand-child and in a back room it was not a deal breaker.  If you want to coordinate with a specific color scheme look at it closely before putting it together.  This was the only&#8230;I repeat only the reason it lost one star.2nd for the money, this was absolutely the perfect toddler bed!  The quality and style was great.  The wood was solid and in perfect condition and was packed with care and not missing any parts.My granddaughter is 2  years old and could get in and out with ease.  She absolutely loved it and so did my daughter and son-in-law.  He thought about telling his parents to buy one.  I think that this bed will last for several years and hopefully more grandchildren.It took about 45 minutes to put together.  The worst part was trying to hold the barrel bolts in place with a screw driver in one hand and tightening the screws with the allen wrench in the other, but it can be done.  Also, the way Amazon had it bundled that you could choose the bed, mattress and pad, and comforter/sheet set was easy.  I did not have to worry if everything would fit because they (Amazon) took the guess work out.  A definite would buy again.",1
"this seat is well made, fits our regular ole toilet seat, and my potty-training three-year-old and two-year-old fit perfectly on it. highly recommend it.",1
"My daughter loved this seat from her first day home! It's cozy and would fit her perfectly (just make sure to use the straps) Her Aquarium bouncer seat is just too big for newborns and offers little neck support.  She would sleep for hours in this cozy little seat!  Now that she is 2 months old, she doesn't like it as much as her swing. I still use this papasan seat to keep her near while I am in the shower and most of the time she will stay happy in it. Now that she is getting bigger, I think we will start using the Aquarium bouncer soon (it offers more stimulation).",1
Very Disappointed it Isn't A Medela! AndThe Cord Is Only 12 Inches Long! I'mStuckRight Next To The Ac Outlet When Pumping!,0
"This is a terrific product, well worth paying for the shipping if you can't find it in the store.  My first one lasted over a year, and I already ordered a second one for my next baby.  A must have!",1
For the price this is a great option to add entertainment to bouncer. It would be great on stroller too.,1
We love this monitor.  The sound is clear (can hear him breathing) and the picture is good even at night.  It's comforting to be able to just switch on the screen to see him.  Rechargeable too!,1
"I originally put this on my registry but saw it on sale at Kohl's and bought it.  I'm looking forward to giving this set to my baby.  The toys are quite large, but they are bright and very detailed.  There is a set for boys too that is equally as cute.  I think this would make a very nice gift!",1
This is one of my favorite towels for my baby.  It is so nice and thick and keeps him warm after getting out of a bath.  The design is cute.  The only thing is it is definitely made for smaller babies because as my baby is getting longer and starting to move around more his feet don't stay covered as well as with his bigger towels.,1
"Well, this pump must work for some people, based on the number of good reivews, but it doesn't work for me--unless I have over an hour to pump 4 oz.  I don't know whether it is the suction or the speed, but it just takes forever to get not nearly enough milk!  Also, this pump has turned off on me for no reason!  (I work from home and don't pump often, so nothing should be worn out yet!)I really like the fact that it is a single pump, as I only pump one side at a time, but this product just isn't good enough to feed my daughter with a bottle, forget about keeping my supply up.  So, I'm still on the search for a good pump.  (Lansinoh is my next try, even though it's a double.)Good luck!",0
These were a gift and are just so cute.  The mother and everyone else loved them.  They seemed very well made. I would purchase more as gifts.,1
Yes..I would recommend this product...soft and cuddly ..granddaughter loves this blanket...second one for her..washes up very nicely.. thank you,1
VERY helpful! This is the 9 volt- you need to know which on you need!! I have the medela pump in style backpack pump. You do need to turn it up more than te electric plug in.,1
"Assembly was a bit rough with the first gate I installed but the second one went much quicker after learning what not to do with the first one. I do recommend using the wall caps for at least the top 2 even if your not using it for stairs. It gives the gate more stability, which is what we need with our dogs. One keeps thinking he can jump it (has yet to make it) and the other keeps trying to lean on it and paw it like he did to get past the wooden ones.Overall it is a solid gate and not that expensive. Happy with my purchase !",1
"This was easy to put together and very cute. It is not as sturdy as I would have liked. We have a similar product by the same company (a holiday themed version) that will support my older nephews as well as the baby. They wanted to sit in the new one right away, but we were quick to explain this was only for the baby. And the baby loves the lullabies and the fact that it vibrates.",1
"I think these baskets are great.  I have 4 of them stocked on my changing table.  I have them filled with diapers, receiving blankets, bibs, burp cloths, bath supplies, etc.  All of it is easily accessible and they look adorable.  I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 only because the first set that I bought I had to fix.  Be careful with the ties on the liners.  The ties on one of mine broke as I was trying to tie the bow.  Our Babies R Us hardly ever has them in stock so instead of returning it and waiting for more to come in, I had to restring the tie through the liner and sew it back together.  A little bit of work but I am still happy with my purchase overall.",1
"Between my almost 3 year old and a 6 month old, I have collected a few child carriers so far - Moby wrap, baby Bjorn, Ergo, Hotslings.  Each one has their own pluses and minuses, and an age and situation that fit best.  Right now, I am using Ergo and Hotslings for my 22lb 6 month old.  But I am always on the lookout for the next great product to try.  This really sounded good at first glance so I ordered one.Pros:The product seems really well made.  Good quality material and construction.  Pretty light considering the size.Cons:1) UncomfortableThey make the promise but it really doesn't work.  You can't have 20,30,40 pounds on one hip with no leverage.  Mine sank on the baby side, and dug into me on the opposite side.  Didn't matter how loose or tight the belt.2) Bulky!I put it on and immediately I noticed the thing is quite big, a lot bigger than I thought.  It is just as big or bigger than my Ergo folded up because of the styrofoam block you have to carry around under the seat.  I originally thought I would just have this on me during the day at home, but no way!  The seat part is pretty bulky so I can't leave it at the hip position.  I would have to turn it behind me to make room for my arms when baby is not on me.  Also the belt is very wide.  When I have it on at a good height for me and baby, the bottom of the belt hits top of my leg.  So when I walk with the baby, the belt repeatedly rubbed against my leg.3) Access to storage is inconvenientThere are several storage pockets that sounded like a plus.  But when I tried to use them, it was pretty hard to reach any of them.  a)The zip pocket under the seat is roomy but hard to access with baby on.  You have to put the baby down to get anything in or out. Kinda funny shape because it wraps around the styrofoam block under the seat.  b)Slots around inside the belt are not usable.  Even their instruction says you have to put the belt on very tight.  They say to buckle it while holding your breath!  With the belt that tight, you just cannot reach into the inner side of the belt to take something out.  c)Mesh pocket they advertise as a bottle pocket is too small for a bottle.  It would fit a granola bar or two quite nicely but seriously nothing bigger or longer will fit.4) UnattractiveIt was just not good looking.  With the wide belt tight around me I felt squeezed in a very unattractive way.  The wide belt with all the velcros and buckle looks quite industrial as well.  Maybe I should have ordered black so they wouldn't show so much, but I felt like a weight lifter.  I don't know if this was a fluke but mine had half a zipper on top of the seat where the baby sits.  What's up with that?  I looked all around it for the other side of the zipper, but I don't think it zips onto anything.So I printed out the return label withint a few hours of receiving this thing.I am back to my beloved Ergo for longer carries & nursing on the go, and have hotslings in diaper bag for short carries!",0
"I bought this for my son after he kept asking for one (a picture of them appeared in one of his books) every day for over a week. I wasn't aware that you only get one race car, so that was a disappointment when I opened the package. I wish the description was more obvious, or that we could at the least pick the color of our own choosing.That all said, it is made very well and does seem that it would last for many years. My son however was disappointed in the color we got, and quickly decided that he was no longer interested in it, or the picture of them in his book. I would only recommend buying this if you absolutely love it. $15 seems way too steep for so little options and to only get one...",1
The bed rail is easy to assemble and solid.  Installed on Graco Lauren crib.  I would definitely recommend this product.,1
"This book has a lot of pages for each age. As the child grows, the number of pages decrease. Too many questions are being asked and a lot of it is cluttered. Not all information that it asks I'd want to answer and the ones that I do want, are not there.",0
"I just received this bag and so far, I really like it.  It is BIG! I can fit a ton of stuff in it without stuffing it to the max.  As an aside-if you order a BIG bag, then don't complain about how big and heavy it is!Things I Love-The strap is super comfortable even with the bag packed and super heavyThe inside mesh pockets are great! This way, smaller things don't slip into the black hole of a large diaper bag.  Here is what I have put in these: my daughters emergency give her a toy B4 she has a meltdown toys in one, some ready made travel formula and a clean bottle in another, her ""suplies"" (baby pain relief, vaseline, nose sucker, butt paste, the all important Bibby and Burpee...you get the picture, lots of room. There are also 2 non insulated bottle holders on the inside as well.The insulated bottle holders- they are big enough to fit 1 8oz each.  I always pack mine with a cold gel pack and this fits as well.  I love the magnet closureI love that it opens like a doctor bag, very convenient.  The downside to this is that it is difficult to open and unzip with one hand.Things I don't Love-There are 2 large outside pockets-this is great.  What is not great is that they do not have any closures.  So, don't put anything in them that you are afraid may fall outThis bag comes with a nice changing pad.  Problem is that it is bulky.  My previous diaper bag came with a nice little self contained changing pad that folded up, velcro'd and was extremely portable (i.e. in a restaurant I would take only my daughter and the changing pad (which held some wipes and a couple of diapers)which had a nice little strap.  The changing pad that comes with this bag can't really be folded any more than in half :( and thus is really not practical unless you bring the whole bag with you to change the baby.  I realized this before I ordered so I did order the ""Be Quick"" pouch.  My first issue is that even though I ordered the same color (brown, with pink) for both the bag and pouch, the pouch is a different, lighter shade of pink.  Also, I had to pack a differnt changing pad into the pouch.All in all, this is the bag for you if you are any over packer like me or if you have more than one kid who needs you to carry their stuff around LOLGreat Quality as well! Feels nice!",1
We got this for my son to wear while in the carrier and at 17 mos old he can still use it around his waist (handy since his pant legs always ride up) in both the carrier and stroller. It is soft and warm and cleans up very easily. I wish I'd gotten two!,1
"This is an absolutely great set for older babies and up.  I never used it for baby food, so I can't speak to the leaking issue.  But for half a sandwich, and snacks like cut fruit, cheese, or crackers, it is perfect.  It's not very big, so if you're going to be out for a whole day you'll need to pack more than this holds, or use the small containers separately so you can put food in the big one too.  I also think that for older than about 2, it might not be quite big enough for a meal-- my 17 month old cleans it out already with no trouble!  I guess that's boys. :)  The lids are somewhat hard to get off, which I'm glad of for my toddler but might be a problem if an older child needed to be independent.  And the main lid warped a bit in the dishwasher, but still fits fine with a little wiggle.  I don't quite understand all the objections to the spoon-- the bowl is sort of flat, and wider than infant spoons, but really not so freakish and useless as you might expect from all the complaints here.  As an added perk, the whole set is also a puzzle-- my son often spends as much time after lunch fitting the little containers into the big one as he did eating.",1
My husband chose this because he was tired of the girls toys being all over the tub and didn't want to spent $30 or so on the Boon products that are basically the same. I was a little wary about how sturdy it would be but I like it a lot. My girls are 4 and they can get the scoop off the wall themselves to dump the toys out or pick them up. It isn't hard to get on or off...simply lift it up. I'd say it is a good quality and was a good price. Holds more than I would have thought also.,1
I purchased this for my 9month old son. He is at the stage where he likes to bang things on the table. He took to this right away. The casstanet is a little hard to make noise. You have to shake it a certain way and my baby can't quite get it yet. He likes the bells and the shaker with beads best. It is sturdy and looks like they will last a long time.,1
"I am an IT consultant and deal with technology on a daily basis.  I am so surprised and excited by this camera's ability I can hardly contain myself.  We played with it for 5 hours when we first got it, just because it was so much fun.  The night vision works so well but it's also scary as it reminded me of paranormal activity.  The picture quality is excellent and the signal works from every room in our 3k square foot home.  The mic is clear sounding and works very well.  I put a screw in the wall to easily mount the camera away from the crib so no wires were near it.  This camera can pan and scan every inch of the nursery.  I cannot believe this technology exists for this price.  I'm ecstatic to use this when our baby is born as I know it will help make sure our baby is safe at all times.  Anyone who gives this device less than 5 stars must have received a lemon.",1
"I purchased this after using the diaper genie product for 18 months. True you don't need to buy special bags, but that means nothing really fits well. Also, there isn't a way to secure the bag. So once it is full it slips down. The smell does not escape while the unit is closed, but when the bag is being changed or when putting a diaper in the smell is bad. The diaper genie did not hold the smell this way. Overall, I would recommend a product like the diaper genie over this one. The cost is higher but so is the overall convenience and ease of use.",0
"The colors are brighter than the image shown, (which I prefer). Very cute and fit the crib well even after repeat washings.",1
I put these on the tables whenever we go out to eat to protect my baby from germs.  I'm able to put her food directly onto the topper and I don't have to worry about her smashing it into the table etc. (She's 9 mos. old). I recommend this product to keep a more sanitary environment for your child.,1
"I absolutely love this stroller and am very happy with it. It is lightweight, easy to fold, basket is easily accessible even with the carseat on. It easily fits into my trunk, where I always keep it. It is small enough that I can still fit my fold up camping chairs, stroller and have enough room for groceries from Costco. It doesn't hurt my back when lifting it in and out of the car. I love that it folds with one hand. I have a Graco carseat and had no problem fitting the carseat onto this stroller. I've never used that strap everyone is talking about. I am able to snap it in. I often times will have to pull on the carseat a little to one side to get it to snap, but that's no big deal to me. Once I hear it snap in, I'm good to go. The features of the stroller are awesome that I'm able to overlook that sometimes I have to wiggle the carseat around a little. I love how this stroller has all the features of a larger, heavier stroller without the bulk and weight. I love how there are cupholders. I can set my phone in one and have my drink in one and then put my keys in the middle. It's great for walks or for going around town shopping. I can hang whatever hooks I want on the handlebar and I often will hang reusable grocery bags when I go to the farmers market or hang my diaper bag or purse. You won't be disappointed if you get this in my opinion. Great deal also.",1
"I purchased these for my third child and was very very satisfied. I was considering going with Avent, but all the reviews I read said they leaked badly. I'm so glad I choose these bottles.They are easy to clean, easy to use. The only time I ever had a leak is when the lid wasn't tight enough, due to operator error.We had no problems with gas or air. The nipple doesn't cave in while the baby is drinking, which is great.The best thing, NUK has a sippy cup that is almost identical to these bottles. The nipple is very similar to the bottles, but trains them on a sippy!",1
"we used these on the fridge, wine cabinet, and other places we needed to child-proof but didn't want to damage the furniture.  they work great, are easy to install, and are easy to open.",1
"With their reputation and safety ratings, Britax has been our number 1 choice. Our 5 month old outgrew his chaperone and I decided to upgrade to the boulevard g3.My husband has the boulevard 70cs and we love it - easy install with latch, easy access to harness adjuster, great fabric. The g3 is even better for harness adjustment.Sadly, when I pulled the seat out of the box, the fabric was not sewn properly. There was a 2 inch gap between the white piping and black fabric.Rather than return this to amazon, I called Britax and they are sending me a new cover. I asked them to send me the cavalier rather than onyx so I won't have an issue with the piping again.Britax customer service is phenomenal and they are sending me a new cover tomorrow. In the past we had a problem with our B ready stroller and they sent us a replacement quickly, so I trust them.I am disappointed this seat made it out of the factory with such an obvious (aesthetic) defect, but quickly forgive Britax as they own up to their mistake. All I had to do was email them a picture of the defect.It is a great seat and I am happy we are sticking with the boulevard! Nothing more valuable than our baby's safety!",1
I love this mattress. Its firm and fits in the new crib perfectly. My girl just loves to jump in the crib.  :),1
"Great, leakproof sippy cup.  MUCH easier to clean than valve-based varieties. I highly recommend this one for home AND out & about.  My friend told me about this brand and I'm so glad we listened to her. We have 2 young kids and we have tried many other brands of sippy in the past, but this is the best, and now this is the only brand of sippy we purchase.  You will need to use a nipple brush to clean the inside of the spout (but it IS easy to clean) - so don't throw out your baby bottle brush & nipple brush just because your baby has graduated to a sippy!On the downside, I find that after about 6 months to a year of daily use, the sippy cup will eventually start to leak a little in one of the top valves.  So you will need to eventually replace the old sippy cup.  But it is leakproof for quite a long time and in that regard is waaay better than any of the other brands we have tried.",1
This item was very nice. It was beautiful in the baby nursery. The materials & the colours used are lovely,1
I brought this toothpaste on the recommendation of my dentist.  My babies love it.  One loves it so much that she screams and cries when I stop.  This is a problem for me but speaks to quality of the product.  TheyIke the gum massage as well as the taste of the toothpaste.  They actually get excited about getting their teeth brushed.,1
"While searching for a witch hazel without alcohol, I found The Homestead Company.  For the past two years, I have been ordering their fragrance free witch hazel for my oily, but sensitive skin.  Then, I purchased the belly oil during my first pregnancy.  I was looking for a product with naturally derived ingredients.  I am very happy to report that I do not have one stretch mark from the pregnancy.  I also used the witch hazel during the post-partum healing process, and it was effective.  That area is so sensitive, so having a gentle product to help the healing process was important.  My experience using the diaper rash oil on my baby has been positive.  I am so fortunate to have found these products because they made a big difference during and after my pregnancy.",1
"This giraffe sound machine was a well-loved and cuddled favorite of my granddaughter's.  She used it for sleeping until she was almost two.  Thus, I have purchased Gentle Giraffes for new parents ever since.  The gift has always been a hit!",1
Absolutely amazing product. great quality and perfect size. My lo loves to stare at the flowers during feedings. Highly recommended.,1
I bought one of these to try- it worked great for about a week.  but taking it on and off wore out the loop and it broke.  currently looking for an alternative.... I will not buy these sleeves again.,0
"At first I really liked this deck guard -- it is very easy to install and its see through so it really is not as ugly as others. However, I was very disappointed recently. I've had the deck guard installed now for about 7 months, and my deck gets direct sun light in the afternoon for about 2 to 3 hours every day. And now the plastic is chipping off, with very little effort I can pull on the guard and it crumbles at my fingertips. Where is the safety there? My daughter is walking all ever the place and I defiantly don't want her to fall off the deck, but also now I'm worried about the tiny scraps of plastic from the guard all over the place. Buy something different, don't waste your time or money...",0
"My 5 mo old loves sleeping with this.  I like leaving a little something in her crib overnight to keep her company.When she wakes up, she likes to play with this.  I like the little rattle and appreciate that it's organic so she can chew on it to her heart's content.",1
I guess they are ok. I have a great deal of trouble seperating them. Would not buy another one.  Thanks,0
"My son seems to like this walker...he plays with the toys and is entertained for about 10 minutes. The down side???? He's too short to walk in it! It says it can adjust 3 levels, and it does - but it starts off really tall! When I went to the manufactures site it said the walkers will accommodate children up to 32"" and 30lbs. Well my son (at 6 months) is 25 inches tall and he's too short for the lowest setting. I'm not sure how much use I'll get out of it as far as ""walking"" is concerned, but he's content to sit in it for awhile...honestly I wish I hadn't bought it because I already have a jumperoo and that's what this really is to me.On the flipside; he loves it when I push him around the house and he gets a great laugh out of it. It maneuvers well when going forwards, backwards is pretty much a straight line. It was hard to push and steer on the carpet, but the tile worked good. Easy to assemble and very affordable as well as durable. Overall, a good buy...especially if your child is about 27"" tall.",0
Purchased as a gift for my two year old grandson and he really loves it! Another Lil People hit! Thanks!,1
"I've had no problems with it. Note the other comments about charging and the single color indicator LED. That's not entirely clear on the device.I also wish there were two barrel jacks. One for charging, one for use. It's one or the other with this device.",1
"My daughter loves anything that rocks, and now she has her very own chair that she can get into on her own.  I love the size and look of the chair, and the smile on her face when she's sitting like a big girl.  My only complaint is that it slides around too easily.  It is low to the ground, but my daughter has fallen over and out do to it sliding out from under her when trying to sit down.",1
"great colors, great for boy not plain blue. big enough for shopping cart and high chair. good quality.",1
"KidCo PeaPod is great accommodation for a child while away from home. I bought is a present for a little boy aged 2 and he was thrilled that he got his tent to sleep. It comes in a nice green color that makes it, at least in my opinion, a bit more suitable for the boys although that is a matter of taste. It's pretty big, even a child up to the 4 or 5 years can easily sleep inside.It's packaged fully assembled with a Micro-Lite pad for sleeping that is already attached to the floor. Also it has two large zipper panels, lightweight mesh to good air circulation and insect protection, window screens that can be adjusted, anchor straps to keep it secured to the ground, UV protection and a bag in which you can carry it.It's really lightweight to carry, around 1,5 kg (3,5 lb) and when it is ready for use it measures 1,3m (L) x 0,6m (H) x 0,8m (D).Fully recommended as great travel bed/tent/even playground for your kid while you are traveling but also you can consider it as a great gift.",1
I love theses cups I had never seen them anywhere else and i am a big Dallas cowboys fan thanks,1
"As some of the other reviewers mentioned, the lights seem like a good idea and I don't even mind the super brightness. The problem is their placement on either side of the clipping surface. It makes these completely unusable. When cutting you need to be able to get under the fingernail with the bottom half of the clipper so that you don't clip off any of the child's finger skin by accident and the best way to do that us to come at the nail at a bit of an angle, using the open edge on the side of the clippers to wiggle them into place. This you can't do with these clippers because the sides are not open, it's where the lights are. Also if you want to cut any part of the nail at an angle, not straight on, you can't do it with these (like if the nail bed is wider than the clippers and you have to cut it in 2 pieces).Actually the best clippers are this model by safety first but without the lights. They have a padded clipping grip and are perfect for tiny nails. Use those in combination with a standard led headlamp you can get at the hardware store. I clip my sons nails this way after he falls asleep and it works perfectly.",0
This is very cute and very boy(i was worried)! We are very pleased with every bit of it! happy happy happy,1
"These bibs are great!  Cleans really easily.  Wash, flip and dry.  The pocket does a decent job of catching food from our messy eater.  It's lightweight so very easy to bring when we're out.We've also tried the bjorn one and love this one much more.",1
"I bought this for my iPhone. I am not allowed to have it at work and have to leave it in my car all day. My phone was overheating from the warm temperatures in the car. I keep the phone in this case, it even has room for the charger and my ear piece. Since using this case my phone does not overheat. I do not use the ice packs. It comes with two. I'm sure this would work great for medicine or snacks. Really cute size. Nice shade of soft pink.",1
"Our son is now 2 and I just couldn't take the snap, crackle, and popping of our cheap monitor anymore, so I researched digital monitors and this one seemed like it got the best reviews overall.  This is a great monitor- I don't have to worry anymore about not hearing my son over all of the background noise or having interference with my cellphone, and if the noise level in the room stays the same it goes to ""stand-by"" mode and you hear absolutely nothing.  It is absolutely wonderful and I highly recommend spending the money on it!!",1
"Excellent stroller. Its a little big but good looking. It's easy to close and open.If u have a small car I don't recomend this stroller, is berry smooth to use in any surface.In 4 words ""it's a good stroller"".",1
This mobile was more than I expected. I did not realize that it had lights and my grandson was mezmerized by it. He's a fussy little guy sometimes but he spent the better part of an hour watching it when I put it up on his crib. It's become one of his favorite things. We both love it.,1
My 11yr old son wanted this after using the one in his classroom to sit at his desk.  He loves it.,1
"I first saw someone demonstrating this product to a buyer right before it hit U.S stores! Out of curiosrity I purchased it, and my 7 month old baby loved it! We often put apple sauce, or water in it and he is obsessed! Will purchase another soon!",1
This H was really pretty and can go with almost any room. But it was really hard to hang and it is still crooked in my room because  I gave up hanging it straight. Other then that this is a great item for brightening up a room.,1
"My 3-month old son adores this toy.  He loves to watch it spin and laughs and coos every time the music starts.  Unlike some other toys, it's very easy for a baby of his age to get the music to play.  It spins easily and always keeps his attention, no matter what kind of mood he's in.  I wish we had the opion of turning off the music because the song gets a bit annoying after a few minutes (to me...not baby), but I suppose as long as he likes it, I can suffer through.  : )  Great toy!",1
"This is a well constructed stroller.  The usual complaints are true.  It is heavy.  Let me repeat.  THIS STROLLER IS HEAVY.  It is sort of incomplete as well as you really need the deluxe seat covers and parent organizer to make it a usable stroller.  That being said, it is easy to assemble, and once you figure out how to fold it, it folds easily.  It is precisely what we needed and expected.  Minus one star for the weight.",1
"Sense my son has been able to walk he has NOT liked riding in a stroller. He would prefer to push it himself. Arg.He is almost 3 now and always rides on this stroller when I ask him to. Sitting doesn't offer a whole lot of room with his 7 month old sister's Graco seat behind him but he doesn't seen to mind. He also rides standing about half the time. I did not install the cup holder for myself because I figured it would make it more difficult to get in and out of for him and he would likely bump his head on it while riding standing.I am certain we don't have a snug fit unit but whatever our Graco seat model is it WILL fit onto this stroller. I had to take off the larger canopy for it to work though. I can still manage enough shade for the little one with the second canopy and the one on her seat as well.I had to tell him almost immediately that the brake was NOT for him to use :) It is pretty easy for him to step on it, but he has been good about not doing it sense I asked him not to.It is a bit longer than a regular stroller, but still easy to move around.WARNING: if you don't have a truck, suv, or a car with a very large trunk/hatch don't bother. Or at least keep in mind you may be returning it if you plan on transporting it. I have a Highlander suv and it's no problem at all. My Wife's Camry didn't stand a chance though (mind you, that car has a relatively small trunk).My only other issue if I had to look for one is the wheels could be larger for times when we drive on the grass at parks.Oh, one more thing, I am 6 ft tall. Short people may kick the standing platform when walking with this stroller.. I think this is the case with most strollers though.I give this stroller a really high recommendation!! It's stay at home dad approved!",1
After 7 months of use still like new is really easy to use and clean i have no problems i will recommend this item,1
"I didn't want to take my big stroller on an upcoming trip for fear of damage on the airplane, so I wanted to take my Baby Jogger City Micro instead.  It fits perfectly into this bag and the makes it super easy to carry the stroller to the gate or from the car.  The bag isn't what I would call heavy duty, but it seems as if it will hold up to at least a few flights.",1
When using this product consistently and properly it will work! We ordered one for our 1 year old because she kept getting her thumb infected. It helped it get healed up very quickly. We told her it was her bracelet and she was excited to wear it! Worked great for us.,1
"I tried several gates before finding this one and it is perfect.  It keeps my small dog in and it stays put. Also, great price.",1
A wonderful and colorful training aid to gentle remind the little ones to take care of their business when playing ....,1
When i heard about this balnket i laughed !!! how will this calm my baby down?? but i watched some videos saw it helped other mother  and i ordered it!!! i used it for the first time after i fed my baby and i changed her pamper so i knew she was comfortable and had no reason realy to cry and wrapped her up and the rest is history!!! i have a changed baby (this item can only be used to calm babies that are fed changed and burped not just to calm a hungry uncomfortable baby!!!!),1
"Seriously first and second time parents, you need to purchase this stroller.Why you ask?Let me tell you the reasons:1. It's super lightweight.  Who cares if a stroller has everything you need if you dread getting it in and out of the car?2. It folds easily, not bulky at all!  You can fold it with the seat attached or not, it's up to you.  Doesn't take much room in your trunk and it is a one step process.3. The seat is reversible.  This was key for my first child.  I wanted to look at him while we were walking around.  When he got older, I reversed the seat.4. The car seat adapter makes this stroller a 'Snap and Go' stroller.  No need to buy another stroller just to keep your baby in the car seat.  So great! Saves you ~$60 bucks.5. The basket is huge!  I would do all my shopping in this stroller and be able to find everything I needed.  I also purchased a 'mommy hook' to attached more grocery bags on the handle.6. The parent console is a perfect size for all the necessities.7.  It looks more expensive than it is.  People were surprised to find out the price of the Indigo Stroller.  They thought I spent $300+.8. Very easy to maneuver. Could easily push with one hand.The only con with this stroller is that the canopy is not that large.  But you can easily buy an attachable canopy to solve that problem.  Also, it's not the most sturdy, but it lasted over 2 years of every day use/abuse, then we had kid number 2 and got a double stroller to replace it.  Wish they made a double stroller version.If the wheels get squeaky, take them off, put some white lithium grease(not WD40) on the shaft, put the wheels back on, and off you go!Looking for the perfect stroller was a pain.  Most were too heavy, bulky, a chore to fold down and super expensive. This is the only one that had everything we were looking for and more...BUY IT!",1
When I first saw this bedding I instantly fell in love! I just had to have it for my little guy. Once it arrived I was truly overjoyed at the quality of the bedding...sooooooo soft! Everything looked just as it did in the picture.,1
"I bought this toy for my daughter right after she turned 3 months old.  She adores this toy, and ""coos"" whenever she plays with it.  She hasn't figured out how to make it squeak yet, but she likes the crinkly wings and she rubs her hands over the different textures.The clip is very handy.  I attach this to her Tiny Love play mat, to her stroller, etc.",1
I love this little potty for car trips.  My 3 year old is petrified of automatic flushing toilets so we bought this chair to use on a recent vacation.  She loves it.  It is really easy to clean.  I just keep some clorox wipes in the car with the seat.  It now lives in the back of my minivan incase of an emergency potty stop.  We are also using a second one to train our 23 month old son.  The splash guard is great and he is very comfortable on the seat.,1
"Package came not heavy to move and i am 7mo pregnant. Easy assembly, solid wood, beautiful color, extremely shiny, goes with our dark cherry nursery perfectly.  I highly recommend it.",1
"I purchased this butterfly to attach to my carrier and it turns out my baby loves the item so much I now attach it to the crib, car seat and sometime on her baby gym. when I attach it to my stroller I get so many people asking me about the butterfly it is beautiful and squeaks as well. cute cute cute!!",1
"These bottles are quite convenient for my baby when he is toddling around the house and just wants to have a sip every once in a while. He doesn't have to strain his neck tipping back for a normal bottle. He took to it quickly and I get tons of comments from people on how great of an idea it is.  A few of my other mommy friends have invested in these as well.My only beef is that it leaks, a lot. If the nipple is at all upside down, say when the baby falls asleep in his car seat, I am left with a messy cleanup. I have tried different nipples by another brand and they seem to keep the leakage down a tiny bit, but not much. Hopefully this is a design flaw they can fix in the future. But soon I won't be needing them anymore :)",1
"The system in general is pretty good - the bags are fine but I don't see why we couldn't use just regular grocery bags or something later.  There is a little lining in these which is nice, and the bags are thick and we haven't had any ripping or leaks - but the lining is hardly enough to even begin to absorb a typical toddler pee so it's almost pointless as you're going to end up with a bag of fluid regardless.",0
"These covers do an excellent job at keeping liquids in. I prefer the velcro to the snap they are faster to use.I would have rated them 5 star except, despite washing it everyday and hanging it in the sun, it now just smells like pee. (Im going to soak them in vinegar & see if that clears the smell. I know that will run the risk or wrecking the plastic coating rendering them useless, but frankly them smelling like pee has put me off them anyway!.)They do make the bum sweaty because they don't breathe, being plastic coated.I have just transferred over to using Lovey bums wool jersey cover. They are a little more work as you have to soak them in lanolin before use, and resoak them every month or so, but the lanolin does make them waterproof and I have found them very effective. They also breathe and my son doesn't get sweaty, great for summer!",0
"I give this 4-star ratings as I don't quite like the cleaning brush.  I think the brush could be improved and also include a smaller brush to clean the silicon teats.Overall, Avent is good brand and it's 'Made in England' so quality is better.  It's easy to hold, easy to wash.  My baby's on it since a few days old as my milkflow came on the 5th day, so we had to supplement her with some formula first (Malaysia is a hot country, so I need to keep the baby hydrated) I find that my baby is able to switch from bottle  without problems, and there was almost no confusion at all.  NO COLIC at all. Most importantly is that there are only a few parts to wash for Avent bottles!!Dr.Brown has got 6 different small parts to wash after each usage, so life can be a havoc if you're a busy working mom.  Dr.Brown is 'Made in China'.  And so is 'Tommee Tippee' bottles.",1
"This is a very well made, sturdy stair gate.  I chose this one because it did not have scary reports of injuries or failure like so many of the stair gates I researched.  We have had no problems with it, it is very sturdy, and easy to open but locks out babies well.  Highly recommended!",1
"Twin boys 18 months old and another on the way. First trimester, wife is sick and I'm now outnumbered. This is not mommy's helper. It's daddy's helper! They hunt in packs and they've been testing my attention for weaknesses....they remember. Now I can still lose track of one and not worry about him cleaning the toilet bowl with his bare hands. And they really gave this thing a test when we first got it. They were trying like crazy to break this thing. It won. I won.",1
Much sturdier than other brands. plenty of adhesive. Holds up nicely. highly recommend this over any other brand out there.,1
"We purchased this stroller for use as an umbrella stroller instead of buying the super cheap ones. We like the Chicco brand. It is very smooth and we like the added features of the sun shade and the goodie basket. I will agree with other users that sometimes my husband kicks the rear wheels and the strap between the child's legs should be longer. However this fits our needs perfectly. We wanted something small, compact, light for our 2 year old in malls and other brief trips. It is very compact and light weight. If you want a full on stroller that has an adjustable handles, cup holders, all terrain wheels I highly recommend the Chicco Cortina Travel System. We loved ours and still use it for the zoo or the fair.",1
"My 5 month old loves this jumpy! This is the one thing I can go to if I need to cook, do homework with the older kids, or get ready!",1
"My wife and I had been searching for a few months for an item like this.  We found others that where much more expensive ($15+ for 5 pads!) but this one was right on the mark.  If you are looking for a way to keep your baby safe on those nasty changing tables when you are out and about, look no further!  These pads hold up when being used, and are small enough to fit easily into our diaper bag.",1
Super stylish and functional. This bag has Lots of pockets and it Can really be stuffed with everything you need.,1
"Complicated to open, but predominately due to very small buttons for very weak hands. More importantly, so long it gave baby enough leverage to rip a cabinet handle off. Are you supposed to cut these to length?",0
our daughter is potty training and this is awesome we move it from her stroller to her car seat and it is so easy. if there is an accident it was easy to wash too.,1
"Ok, I admit, that setting it up could have been easier.  It took two of us. However, now that it's in use, I cannot imagine my life without it.  I love the fact that it fits so securely to our bed, nothing can get between it and our mattress unless I purposely shove something (like the sheets) in between there.  I can easily pick up our baby and soothe her or nurse her.  It's also incredibly easy to calm her by reaching my hand over and stroking her little head.  I can also sit up in bed, slip a &#34;chuck&#34; between her and the crib sheet, and change her diaper.  Believe me, when the pains of having just delivered a baby are still screaming between your legs, having the ability to attend to your baby without getting up constantly - is essential!  The co-sleeper looks nice, doesn't need the additional waterproof mattress liner (mattress already is waterproof enough), but it's important to buy extra sheets (not standard crib sheets either). A talented seamstress could sew additional sheets, but they require quite a bit of detail on the underside (velcro, loops, button holes...) to attach to the co-sleeper properly. One sheet does come with the co-sleeper purchase.Noteworthy: having a high bed isn't a problem with the extension pieces.",1
"I love the way this chair completely forms around my sons body.  It supports him enough to not have to worry about him wobbling around.  It is very portable and light and fits nearly everywhere.  I use it even in the bottom of the tub while I'm showering.  Although it would be nice if it came up a little more in the back to help support his neck now that he's a little bigger it's not much of a concern anymore.  My only complaint would be that the buckles inside aren't very comfortable for him, but I'm sure they are required as a safety precaution.",1
This blanket is super soft and fuzzy on one side and silky on the other side.  It is very light but very warm.  I think I'll have to buy at least one more for when this one is in the laundry!,1
These are a MUST HAVE for cloth diaper-ers.  The fact that they are flushable sold me right away: septic-safe as well.,1
"Either I can't figure out how to use it or it's poorly made. The light keeps blinking, doesn't stay on. Waste of money.",0
I love this teething guard.  The fit is so clean and nice looking on my son's crib.  It fits tight and the material is easy to wash.  I have had it for about 6 months and it never wears when I wash it.  The color is rich and beautiful and it is gender neutral.  I would say this is the #1 teething guard to buy.  I purchased another one but the material wore quickly and it looked worn and old.,1
"We decided to purchase this model after researching MANY different kinds of convertible carseats for our now 1 year old.  Had the return window not closed, this would be going back.  Our daughter has ridden in this a total of 4 times, and we are not happy with this seat.  We upgraded to this from a Chicco Keyfit 30, and I wish now we had stuck with Chicco.  The straps are very difficult to loosen in order to put our child in the seat, and the hugs pads are hard to snug down.  Not to mention the recline - I have no idea why this is recommended from newborn and up.  For rear-facing, we have it in the 3rd and farthest recline position, but it still is not reclined far enough for our daughter.  We had to place a towel under it to make the seat level (lame), and the 2 times our daughter has fallen asleep, her head has fallen forward on her chest - NOT GOOD!  We have this in a 2006 Toyota Avalon, just to give you an idea of how it fits.  Hopefully this will help someone else out - we're sticking to Chicco and plan to get the NextFit as soon as we can.",0
Bought this for our little girl to start potty training and it is adorable.  Easily attaches to any TP roll and the wipes container fits right onto it.  Smart idea and perfect for having the flushable wipes within arms reach for any kiddo clean up!,1
"These bottles were the perfect solution for my son who gagged on other ""rounded"" nipples.  We were previously using Avent bottles and it was taking him 30-40 minutes to drink his 6oz bottle (he's 10 weeks old).  Since he only took MAM pacis, I decided to give these bottles a try.  It worked like a charm!  He now takes 6oz in 10-15 minutes and does not gag on the nipple because it is more flat.  I am so glad I made the investment to switch!",1
"I spent A LOT of time researching strollers. Reading reviews. Watching videos. Our ""baby"" just turned two and I really didn't want to have to purchase another stroller, but life dictated otherwise. We have recently moved to England from the states and we've been doing a ton of traveling. The two strollers I brought with us, a Chicco Liteway .. my ""mall"" stroller and a Kolcraft Contours .. my neighborhood/walking/park stroller, weren't working. The Chicco wasn't able to handle cobblestone streets or walking in cities where we'd be navigating sidewalks and then stop at a park and need to push through the grass. And the Kolcraft was just HUGE. A pain on public transit. A nightmare in shops or restaurants. So, I finally settled on the City Mini GT. I couldn't be happier. We just got back from a weekend in London and it is the best stroller for different terrains, easy fold up, pushing with one hand while sipping a coffee. The seat is really cushy, the straps are easy to adjust. The handlebar is also adjustable so both my husband (6') and I (5') can push it comfortably. I did purchase a parent ""tray"" from a different company which I haven't received yet and the child tray from Baby Jogger (which hits my daughter at mid chest so it's a little awkward ... we actually left it at home this trip).  For $350 I feel that these ""extras"" should come standard. There is a warning that says not to hang anything on the handle and there's a reason for it! When the stroller is fully reclined and you have something hanging from the handle the stroller is VERY tippy. I used stroller straps and attached our diaper bag to the side of the stroller and didn't have any problems with tipping. If the seat is up you can hang a bag on the handle without worrying about tipping. The mesh pockets on the back are nice. I put my cell phone, keys and water bottle in them. The under carriage basket is essentially useless. Even with the cut-away at the back we couldn't fit much in it. We did manage to put a few small shopping bags in from the side, but that's basically it. Also, the seat reclines almost flat and the hood is huge. My daughter took two really good naps in the stroller over the weekend which she never did in the our other strollers. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend it. I only wished I'd purchased it earlier. Really thankful Amazon offers shipping on most items to APO addresses!",1
"Most inexpensive I could find for making our own rsvp for my daughters wedding, they were perfect, and came within a couple of days which was a blessing!",1
"The panels helped to expand the pen for my puppies to help monitor them while outside.  It's easy to set up, move and store!",1
"This is a great organizer for the bath toys. Oversized, very durable and sticks to the bathtub. Perfect for scooping up and draining the toys.",1
"My wife and I were looking for a car seat for our first born son.  I am a safety professional so I was looking for the safest seat available.  Consumer reports gave this a great review so we decided to purchase it.  We absolutely love it, getting him in and out of the seat is easy.  Putting it on the base is very simple and with no difficulty.  The only thing we wish was better would be to have a larger canopy to protect him from the sun.  Would definitely recommend this car seat!",1
I bought these for my grad-daughter for her water table outside but she ended up playing with them all the time.,1
"My 4 month old daughter loves the spin and play garden. It's the perfect tummy time play mat!!! I just wish it had been around when my son was that little. He's 19 months old and plays with his sister with the attached toys. It's a must have for any new baby! It is well built and even stands up to my son's not so gentle touch. It stores easy when not in use, and is easy to clean. This is definately worth the money you pay for it. I just can't help but sing the praises of this wonderful toy!!!!",1
"I had initially given this product five stars because it seemed to me a terrific alternative (and I actually found it EASY to refill the empty cartridges!).  But after using this alternative for a few weeks, I had to delete my original review and caution everyone about something noted by another reviewer. -- The plastic ""tubing"" you get here does NOT contain the SMELL of your kid's poop!!!  It was really puzzling at first, and I admit I was in denial for a time. -- I figured there must have been a tear somewhere.  But no, there was absolutely no breach in the integrity of the plastic and yet still the foul smell escaped.  So either the Wrapooh people use an inferior grade of plastic that is far more porous than the brand name product, OR the brand name product actually contains a deodorant of some kind that I never appreciated before.  So SADLY I cannot ultimately recommend Wrapooh, as much as I really wanted to believe there was an alternative option.  And I wasted money on two of these!  I do hope the Wrapooh people take this as instructive.",0
"I used this rack for my Avent bottles, which are very wide. I can fit 8 comfortably. Just like other reviews I had read said. Seems a bit flimsy but it definitely does the job! I love it.",1
NorthState's extra wide gate. I am a professional child proofer. This is the only gate I use when closing off wide openings. It is inexpensive. Easy to install. You can remove it from time to time. It is not intrusive.Over all a very workable and affordable solution..,1
"I sent these back, because I was looking for something flexible. The description was misleading & said they were flexible, but these are a thin hard plastic- only slightly flexible. It looks like the description has been corrected now. Silicone would have been nicer. These were also quite small, so they wouldn't be good for use with a toddler. They probably would be better for spoon fed babies.",0
"This is a great buy.  However, the info provided is misleading.  This item comes with only the main unit.  You have to buy the solution, pads, and instructions from [...] separately.  I've used it a couple times, with no noticeable difference, but I wouldn't expect the results to be immediate.",1
"This is such an easy and clean way to dispose of dirty diapers! Quick, one hand operation & NO odor problems!!!",1
"I initially bought this potty chair for our daughter to save space in our small bathroom, but we recently moved and have switched to theBoon Potty Bench Training Toilet with Side Storage, Kiwifor the main potty chair, and use this as an extra potty chair to use in other rooms. It's very compact and portable, which makes it easy to carry from room to room, and the inner potty is very easy to remove and clean. So far, we are just getting our daughter to sit on the potty from time to time to get used to the idea of it, but are not seriously potty training yet. She likes to sit on it and read books, and we've had a few successes with it so far!A couple drawbacks: It is pretty small, which is good in that it is space-saving, but I worry that it will be too small for my daughter when she gets a little older and we are more seriously potty training. Another issue is that because the inner potty is so easy to remove, my daughter can pull it out with ease herself, and she's always carrying it off somewhere!",1
"Very soft thick fleece, which is great.  My only issue is that sometimes the zipper comes apart during my son's sleep.",1
"I purchased this rocker for my grandson when he was one month old - he's 4 months old now.  And he sits in the rocker almost every day to watch his Baby Einstein videos.  When he has an upset stomach, the vibrations seem to help him work it out!  I had researched different seats before purchasing this one and am 100% happy with it.  I assembled the rocker myself, and didn't have any problems understanding the directions.",1
This pillow is the best.  I am 18 weeks and didn't realized how badly I was sleeping at night until I got a good night sleep with this pillow.  It did not come with a removable cover so be sure to order one.  It takes a few minutes to get the cover on.,1
"This product looks great in the baby room and Has plenty of storage.  Also, it got here quickly with no problems.",1
Such a good price!!! My car windows have zero tinting so these were a must. I bought two sets so I could have more shade for my babe. One on each rear door window and two on the rear window. Doesn't block all the sun but it keeps pure sunlight off my babies face.,1
Love these spoons!  First used them at my sister in-laws and had to order them!  The spoon fits a lot of food on it and it easily slides into my sons mouth.,1
"I really like this bag -- nice and roomy, with three interior pockets, two exterior pockets, plus matching accessories.  I love the zippered pouch for keeping changing supplies ready to hand, and the changing pad has a little bit of padding, which is nice without adding bulk.  Nice insulated bottle holder too.  It ships direct from Amazon, so the shipping was LIGHTNING fast!There is only one big drawback to this bag, and it's a doozy -- the one I received (as of 12/13/07) was chocolate brown and white, NOT brown and blue as pictured.  Changing pad is chocolate brown too.  But upon seeing it, I liked it BETTER than the brown and blue one I thought I was getting.  It is very gender neutral and stylish, great for a parent that is waiting for a ""surprise"" baby, or for someone who wants something a little more sleek and a little less baby-ish.Some things that I would have liked to see are an interior zippered pocket for Mom, a tether for keys or pacifier, or possibly an elasticized interior pocket large enough to put a bottle or sippy cup inside and keep it upright, but these are just nit-picky.  The overall function is great!  The pockets inside are just the right size for small items or diapers. The pockets on the outside the perfect size for the 4oz Avent bottles or for other small sippy cups with the flap closed.  For larger or taller cups and bottles such as a 16.9 oz bottle of water, they fit great but you can't close the flap.  Not an issue -- they work just fine. Objectively, these are not as important as having to room to pack what you need.  Some diaper bags have so many pockets that you run out of room for larger items like toys, blankies and clothes.  Not so for this bag.  There is a nice balance between pockets and room, style and function.",1
Smaller than it looks and so the font on the pacifier is pretty small too. A little disappointed because I chose this one over another one that was only about a dollar more ...that one had the cute little semi-circle handle attachment too. Well the nipple size is good for a newborn so it's a keeper.,1
"very well priced very durable. I bought this for my daughter. It was easy to assemble, it came with everything you need. took me about ten min to get it up and going. I also bought the paper and paints and markers to go along with it. My daughter has used this every day since santa brought it. chalkboard, white board and paper. it can be used in a classroom with kids its that durable. but easy to move around and easy to store. Any questions just ask me. I am not an expert but I can tell you what my daughter and I do with it. I really like materials and products that feel sturdy and this is one of them.",1
"The wheels get stuck all the time! Very hard to push, and steer! Have to take things apart, in order to let it down",0
It works great for the first few weeks. It get a lot harder keeping it in place once the baby is a little older and more squirmy on the changing table. Overall I'm glad I bought it. It saved my a couple of times from a wet mess,1
"I love this bouncer.  My son took awhile to notice the fish in front of him but boy when he did he went crazy.  He loves it.  It's how I take a shower, eat dinner, etc.  My only complaint is the toys come down so low they touch his legs and bother him.  I took off the linkadoos and now all is well.  I would buy this one again.",1
"very good baby carrier, rocking chair with vibrator to sleep the baby, easy to carry, lightweight, good time entreg and packaging according to what is offered, I recommend",1
"The Summer SwaddleMe WrapSack Blanket, What a Hoot, Small  is a quality product. I loved the bottom zipper for easy diaper changes without having to disturb the baby. It was a great feature so we even though the baby might wake up you don't have to fight putting the swaddle back on.The material wasn't as nice as other brands hence the 4 instead of 5 stars.",1
"Great diaper bag!  It is perfect for quick trips and everyday use.  I love how it has magnets instead of velcro closure.  The multiple pockets are great.  I bought it to use as a diaper bag for when I am running errands, etc.  It is made really well and with high quality materials",1
"Could use better instructions, a little difficult to follow. Once together my sone loved it, fit nicely with the design of his room.",1
My little one is absolutely head over heels for this little giraffe!!  When he sees it for the first time his eyes light up immediately.  It doesn't hurt that you do not have to worry about a recall or be concerned about the materials she is made of.,1
"The print looks more like a cow print than a pony, but that is easily visible through the picture.  My daughter loves the chair and it seems well built. We have not put the rockers on yet, but it is great without them.",1
"Works really well, my little guy likes to sit at the table so this is a perfect traveling highchair to take to friends and restaurants.",1
"I really like this container. It is a great size, and it's shape fits very nicely about anywhere. I really like knowing it is BPA free and the green is a nice touch!",1
"We had our first baby five months ago and everyone told us we were nuts for using cloth diapers. They all bet us that we'd give up within the first month. I can honestly say these are one of the best decisions we ever made for our baby and our family. They are environmentally friendly, easy to care for, INCREDIBLY inexpensive compared to disposables, and gentle on our baby girl's delicate skin. She has never had diaper rash! We have turned several friends on to gDiapers as well. What's more, we can use the same diapers for every baby we have after our daughter is out of them. I highly recommend buying the Newborn Bundle as it includes the tiny gPants, which snap down to protect the umbilical stump until it falls off. We love our gDiapers!",1
"Very fine quality! The suede feels very nice! I love the two front pockets (the 2 squares of &#34;leaves&#34; on the front are the pockets). As it's next to the changing table, I will usually tuck his jammies for the night in the pocket.Definitely worth the money!",1
"My 16 mo old loves being in the Ergo and I love having him close by. The Ergo is engineered in such a way that you do not feel like you're carrying 25lbs. It's a great product and easy to put on. I love the front zippered pocket. I can stuff so many things in it that I don't need to carry a diaper bag.I think with babywearing, the key is to start right away. My son only wants to be in the Ergo, he doesn't want to sit in a grocery cart or walk in a store. This can be good and kind of annoying, but at least I don't have to chase around a toddler while I'm trying to shop.I love how when he's feeling shy he can bury his head into my chest and when he's feeling playful, he can touch my face. He also likes to chew on the hood straps, which keeps him occupied.You can discretely breastfeed in it, but I found that more trouble than it was worth.",1
I used this with an evenflo pump and Ameda purely yours and I absolutely love it!!! I have DD'S and this helped keep the pump still as opposed to what a hard time I have holding my pump up with my hands. Very comfortable and adjustable.,1
Very easy to use and makes diaper changing much faster.  I wish we had seen this product a year ago.  This is a Nursery &#34;must have&#34;!,1
"The Joovy Highchair works really well for our home! It folds up tightly so you can put it against a wall or in a small space which is very important in our smaller home. I love that you can take the tray off so we can pull our son right up to the table to interact more with us at dinner! It also wipes down really easily (it's plastic/fake leather chair). No assembly required, couldn't be easier or have all the essentials we need!",1
This carseat is beautiful in color. The purple is a very deep royal purple and looks like it cost a lot without you having done so! I love the really big harness clip at the bottom of the seat. It makes it very easy to buckle a wiggly infant in. The only thing that takes away from the carseat is the attachable side cup holder. It looks a little cheap. But seems to be very sturdy. It folds up when not in use. Overall really great product for my money. I priced the same carseat for $20 more at Wal-mart.:),1
"I bought this as a bag to use when I take my kindergarten class on field trips.  It worked perfectly, fitting everything I needed and I received quite a few compliments as well!LOVE.  I would definitely recommend this item!",1
I bought this elephant night light for my son's room. The light is sturdy and well made and gives off the right amount of light. It is also very cute and fits my son's elephant themed room. It definitely deserves 5 stars.,1
Got two of these and really like that they are a nice quality and larger than most baby bath towels.,1
"Bad,just bad.It didnt fit my bath tub faucet only the knobs.It's way to small and after the first wash it turned redish around the corners.Complete waste of money.I just bought the elmo faucet protector and it works great.",0
"I wish that this was stickier, but it gets up most of the pet hair. For the cost it is fine, but I'm still on the hunt for a better solution for cleaning the couch.",0
I wanted them for outdoor eating with preschooler and the adhesive strip on the back was perfect to keep them in place.,1
"I am using this as a gate for my outside deck. Works great with the thru gate.  WHen I originally ordered, it did state that it had the option to be wall mounted with screws, but it mounts only with the tension knobs, which work great.  It does look like it will rust a bit, but a little white Rustoleum takes care of that.  Not bad since this is meant for indoor use anywayRecommended",1
"I ordered the Flensted Mobile: Wings Black & it arrived intact today, Jan 8, 2009.  Upon taking it out of the box, the item consisted of 3 flimsy small black cardboard mobiles with a small round red ball at the base, all of which were held together by a thin black thread.  Upon unwinding the pieces, the thread immediately broke causing the pieces to come apart with the red ball rolling across the floor.  What a ripoff!  I paid $57.00 for maybe 25 cents worth of cardboard held together by a yard of sewing thread not even strong enough to keep the pieces together!  Never again!!  James Motley",0
"I am giving these as a gift, I hope they will like them. They are very large pads and very soft. I could even see smaller chested ladies folding them for double the protection. Loved that these are Organic/Eco Friendly!",1
"MAM products are high quality, and suitable for babies.",1
"I love the pattern and it looks perfect in the room.  Just wish it was a bit 'stretchier'  I don't have a standard size crib, so this probably looks fab on a standard mattress.  I just have to tuck it around the edges creatively.  Still love it too much to worry about that small detail.",0
"I thought this toy would jingle when it was knocked over and then come back up again, encouraging my daughter to reach and grab.  Well, the toy doesn't jingle.  The toy sounds like there is a single bell buried in the belly and you have to shake the toy very hard to hear the noise.  The starfish hat doesn't squeak, and the ball doesn't come back up again.  However, my daughter (now 3 months adjusted age) likes looking at the octopus face and the octopus arms are just the right size for her tiny hands to grab onto.  She can pull the toy around and it is light enough for her to move easily.",0
"Hard to clean and eventually I have to throw out and get new ones. They do the job, they don't leak unless upside downa nd it comes out through the straw. But the straw is hard to clean very well.",1
We got this 3 months ago for our twins that were 13 months old at the time and we love it (wish we had gotten it sooner).  We got it with the intent to store toys in it in our family room and occassionally put the kids inside while mom had to be on the phone or get something done around the house.  Ours is on carpet but up against a fireplace that is closed up so the back 2 sides do rest on tile instead of all on carpet and this does help it stay in place better.  One time they did manage to move it enough to tip it and climbed out themselves(and came walking down the hall towards me).  We have no problem fitting the 2 kids in there with some toys/books with no extensions.  So if you don't have the space for extensions this size really does work fine.  Hope you like this as much as we do!,1
I purchased the Playtex Nurser bottles based on recommendation that it helps decrease the amount of air babies swallow. I was able to stay home with my second child and would have more time to be able to mess with the bags etc. To my surprise these bottles are easier to use then standard bottles! I love the pre-formed drop-ins and because of the bags they warm up in half the time. In fact I tried them in a bottle warmer &amp; it became way to hot in only 1 minute. Instead I simply warm them in a cup of hot water for a few minutes. My daughter hardly ever suffers from gas and it is so convenient being able to toss the bags in the trash. No more bottle crud! These bottles are convenient &amp; great for babies tummy! I highly recommend them.,1
"My wife love it, the size suggested is perfect, we are buying one more.... just in case this bra is just for pumping not for wearing all day.",1
Got this bag for Christmas from my husband. I love everything about it. It has three small compartments and comes with a changing pad and wipe container. Easy to clean and made very well. Every  time I go some where I receive a compliment on what a cute bag it is.,1
"1. It lights up the picture at the bottom, the buttons, and at the top, which means baby is captivated.2. It plays several different melodies, Jazz, Classical, lullabies, nature sounds, etc. And each genre has several different songs.3. Gives u the option to shuffle so it doesn't get monotonous.4. The little animals rotate constantly so baby has fun watching and trying to catch one.5. It turns off by itself after 40 minutes so the batteries don't run down.6. She can kick that lighted button on the bottom to turn it on.7. Lights are optional, so if lights disturb kiddo, music plays without them.There. 7 reasons why my 5 month old loves it. Want the #1 reason I do?? She is entertained which means I don't listen to her fussiness when it's bedtime and can lay her down guilt free.",1
Gate looks great but still required installation and mounting. Good gate to keep dog from other areas of house.,1
My daughter loves to lay in her crib and watch this mobile. It is very easy to install and is a great value!,1
"Someone got us a pack of smaller swaddling blankets and this large blanket.  We thought this one was too big, it was comical.  Then our already big baby kept getting bigger, and the 36-38 inch blankets were a joke.  This huge blanket does the trick, and I'm finally ordering two more in other patterns.  I wash it frequently and it's holding up well so far.",1
This is a great book for my 6-7 month old. It's soft and crackles and is fun to read! He loves to pull down on the flaps as well so this is a wonderful book and I will probably buy it as a gift for other expecting mothers.,1
"First off my daughter loves this car seat and it works great when she is buckled in.  The problem is that it becomes somewhat dangerous when she is getting in and out of the car.  There is no way to secure the seat itself to the car.  As a result if she hold on to the arm rest when getting out of our car it will fall out along with her.  This is particularly problematic since we use this in a mazda CX-9 which puts her several feet above the ground.  Unfortunately the armrest provides a natural place for her to hold onto making this hard to avoid.Please note that this is a problem with nearly every booster seat currently produced.  As such I would still recommend this item, but beware of the potential dangers.  The companies really need to start producing these with latch attachments to keep everything in place.",0
Love it's purpose and the quality is great as well ! I live in a very windy area so this was a nessesity so that my baby wouldn't be getting sick all the time from the wind blasting her in the face everytime I went out for a walk. It fits very nice and snug on the stroller and it does an exceptional job at protecting baby from the wind so I love it !,1
Purchased this seat for my grandson had a chance to try the potty training this past week.  Every time I would lift him off the seat the whole seat cushion would be stuck to his buttocks.  Opening seems a little too small for him.  Did not like it at all!!!,0
"I really like this cover up, it very helpful!  I have used it in public as well as home with visitors!!  Great buy!",1
"What you should know is that after I paid well over $100.00 on this item. Target had it at almost half the price. And no, it was not on sale in target, it was regular price.  For that money it should move, play music or something.",0
"This seat is very easy to install and much easier than some car seats to fit snug. I had to practically break my back to tighten my last seat and with this it is easy. My son also seems much more comfortable. I haven't been in a crash, so I can't speak to how safe this seat actually is, but I did quite a bit of research and heard nothing but positives. I feel very safe putting my son (16 months old) in this car seat when traveling, which is the number one reason I bought it.There are only two potential issues I'll warn potential buyers about. If you like the thought of taking your child out of the car in the car seat while they are sleeping, this is not the seat for you. There is no handle to do so, which will all but guarantee needing to wake your child.Secondly, this seat ships with the small harness, which is not meant for children over 20-25 pounds because it's so short. I don't know why Britax won't ship the strap that is meant for bigger children, but they don't. Luckily, if you simply write Britax and request the bigger harness, they will ship it to you free of charge (mine arrived within a week). Still, it's a bit of a hassle to do so, which is worth mentioning.",1
"When my daughter outgrew her infant seat we purchased another, less expensive convertible car seat. I know that all the care seats have to meet the same safety standards so I was hesitant to spend a ton of money if they are all about the same. Boy was I wrong! My daughter hated the other car seat almost instantly, it was difficult to install, and the straps always dug into her neck (even with pads). I finally decided to break down and buy one of the more expensive car seats and I don't regret it all. My daughter, who is 1.5, is now so much more comfortable and can actually fall asleep in the seat without her poor head bobbing all of the place. The padding is soft, the straps easily adjust for height and tightness, the strap pads that come with the seat are soft and removable. The seat is also a breeze to install and didn't require any extra padding or adjustments to get it to fit in my car. I would say that this car seat is definitely worth the money!",1
it's an ok toy but the description had me thinking it actually had music and did more than what it does,0
This was a great product very durable and very pretty we resally love it and it came to us in a very fast time,1
"Ordered the hello kitty rug for my sisters birthday, came in a good amount of time and was really awesome!",1
my boys are rough on everything. We have had these for two months now and they still look new. They are dishwasher and microwave safe... SO WORTH IT!,1
"I have been on the market for a non-toxic baby bathtub. This is one of the most important baby items to make sure is made without harmful chemicals because you are putting warm water in it and soaking your child in it. If you put your child in a regular baby tub, you might as well call it BPA/pthalate broth.So here's the tummy tub. Non-toxic. I show it to my husband to get his buy-off, and he, like many, declares it a glorified bucket.So I tested this. We happen to have a number of food-grade plastic buckets hanging out in the garage. I fill one up with water and proceed to try bathing our 6 month old daughter. Complete and utter disaster. First, because there's no water fill line on the bucket and I'm blindly filling it, I filled it too high and she's breathing in the water as I'm furiously trying to dump the excess out. Then she's panicking because, like every food-grade bucket, it's opaque. She can't see outside of it, it's too tall and covering her line of sight, so she feels trapped. Also, because the walls of the bucket are straight, she's flopping all over the place. She was so upset I took her out of there fairly quickly.So we try the tummy tub out of curiosity. There is a very clear water fill line, and the directions are clear about the optimal temperature for the water. The directions show me how to lower her in the water safely and slowly. The walls are clear so she can see what's going on, and the walls of the tub support her in a sitting position. She loves it!! She immediately takes to enjoying her bath-there's a smile on her face, she splashes around, she is calm and in good spirits. I never had this reaction from her in our old tub, the First Years infant to toddler.Instant love!!",1
This was the hit of Christmas morning fun. Product shipped quickly and was as described. Loads of fun for all ages.,1
"I find these bought for one reason, meal time.  They are a nice size, our girl is 6 months old, and long, 28"" and skinny 14 lbs.  She wears these and they fit nice, velcor makes the adjustable, and they are on for the food, they wash out and stay clean, and are a great broad size, covering her clothes all the time during food.Great buy, value is outstanding, will buy more if I need to but they seem to be very durable, and wash out easy so no stains so far, and I am talking prunes and carrots, so good deal, buy them!!we also use baby gear ones and they are similiar.",1
"These are made really great.  But, the white diaper covers get dirty looking really fast.  Stick to the colored ones.",1
I ordered this truck print as well as the train print by the same artist for my son's nursery. They are very sweet and the colors look even better in person.,1
"I wanted a booster seat for my rather large 3 year old that still offered 5-point restraint.  Indeed this unit has it, but there are not enough adjustment slots for the crotch strap for growth.  Will have to go to lap belt sooner than I prefer.  Additionally, this uses the cheap, very thin straps that twist and frustrate.  The release button is very hard to press, which might be ok (even preferred by some), but no for me.  The plastic strap guides pop out of the fabric too readily.  Good features are comfort for kid, price.  If you are coming from a Britax, you will likely be disappointed.  I am also somewhat concerned that the stellar reviews for this product, and the seemingly negative votes for bad reviews are questionable.",0
"I read the reviews for the latex ones and they were awful. I searched everywhere for these and couldn't find them until now. I'd rather pay a few dollars for this spout than replace the whole cup every few months. This is the best learner cup for our toddler, and the only one she'd use until she was 14 months old. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because it took us forever to find them, they were on back order, and they have to be replaced every few months. We replaced them after 4 months when one of the spout tips began to enlarge and liquid would pour out.",1
"This product is great and Amazon has the best price on it w/ the free shipping. If you're using the Graco Snugride, this stroller frame is perfect. The car seat clicks on so easily w/out any fuss. It feels very secure. The stroller is as lightweight as it advertises and as easy to fold up for storing. Perfect addition to your removeable infant car seat for shopping trips, etc. Don't waste your time with those bulky travel systems that every mom tells you they never even used.",1
This is a wonderful keepsake box. It has two chambers inside the box that is very convenient to seperate your children's memories.,1
"I was able to snatch these up for free on a promotional day! Baby isn't here yet, so will be quite a while until I get to test them out.",1
"This product is very cute.  Unfortunately, it stopped working the second day of use, which was a bummer because my son was excited about brushing for the first time.  junk.",0
"My little girl seems cozy in her woombie. We were swaddling her, but she was breaking out of her swaddle while she moved in her sleep and would wake up. Now, she stays cuddled in her woombie!",1
Purchased several years ago and I'm still using it.  Great quality!  Easy to use (even with arthritic fingers)!!! Quality item.,1
"We got the high chair delivered the day my baby girl turned 6 months old. I am so happy we did! I researched high chairs for months, thus being the reason we didnt get one sooner. I was back and forth between this one and the Fisher Price Zen, seeing as I have the Zen swing and bouncer..and love them.. Ultimately I went with this one because of the postive reveiws, the easy to clean, the options and the smaller foot print.This thing is more like a 10 in 1 than a 4 in 1First of all, it was so easy to put together, Im the mom, I did it myself in about 10-15 minutes. I wondered if it would be high enough for my counter height table.. to be level with us while we are eating. If it went up one more height adjustment it would be perfect, but I love everything else about so much that its easy to forgive. It also goes super low, so she can see everything going on down near the floor if we are just all hanging out in the living room. Its obviously perfect for our formal dining room also, its a regular height table. I love the leatherish seat cover, its soft and very easy to clean, and the printed insert is also an adorable pattern.Ive read the reviews about the snack tray being to far from their baby.. I noticed that too - EXCEPT.. you can adjust how car the try slides in and out from your baby - which is fantastic! Also.. there are pretty much 3 trays in all. The clear plastic cover that you can put in the dishwasher, the tray without the cover and the small snack tray.It comes with the second toddler booster which is seperate from the chair, so you need to have a place to store it if you arent using it with a second child.Overall, I love this chair, its modern, yet not too over the top - its trendy with nice color tones and not too bright and crazy like a lot of baby toys/entertainers are.Oh - a note about the foot rest, you feel as if you might break it when installing, just give it some force and it snaps right in.",1
"The cord is to short to hit all the keys, it's only 12 inches long. The photos are very deceiving.",0
Purchased for daughter who thinks this is wonderful. She saw one a friend was using. The friend recommended it as well.,1
"We have a boxer mix, now 8 months old.  We gate her in the kitchen every day, using 3 of these gates.  It is nice that we can open the doors when we are home and not have to mess with uninstalling and reinstalling gates every day.  The doors are way worth it.  This have held up well so far.  Just make sure your doorways are the right size for them, either with or without the extensions.",1
"This pacifier holder is cute, but it is not the most practical or most convenient. Very small. Not great value for money. Not easy to sanitize. The plush changing pad by Ah Goo Baby is fantastic, however!",0
"These bumpers are nice, and they come with a roll of tape. But you'll find the roll of tape is about 6 feet shorter than the roll of bumper - at least if you want to tape the top and the side down. I don't know of any children that wouldn't pull it off if you didn't. So now we have a coffee table that is protected on 2 sides. Great. Fortunately he hasn't figured how to walk all the way around it yet. So I guess I've got a day or two to find some more double sided tape.",0
"I bought this for my daughter when she was 5 months old. She loved it! I'm rating it a 4 star because she's almost 6 months now and is almost to tall to use it. I think bouncers like this should have more of an adjustment for taller, bigger babies. I'm glad I made this purchase, but again... I'm not so happy that she's almost out of it and it's only been a MONTH!",1
I was surprised to see all the negative reviews saying this didn't work or didn't fit. I've been using this on my daughter since she was around 7 or 8 months old. We have no problems with water getting on her face - you do have to hold it against their forehead so that the flexible part forms a &#34;seal&#34;. It doesn't seem to be uncomfortable for her. We have a sprayer attachment for our shower and this visor allows me to rinse all the shampoo out of my baby's hair in just a few seconds with no tears or fuss. This is honestly one of the most useful baby items we own.,1
"I registered for the bumGenius 4.0 One size pocket diapers with the snaps and was initially bummed that the one size AIO diapers came out after all my showers were through.  We needed a few more diapers so we supplemented with a 6 pack of the bumGenius freetime diapers.  Love the colors that they offer and the snaps keep these diapers on well.  I was also expecting the freetime diapers to be one ready to go diaper with the insert sewn inside rather then being able to be removed. However, the OS AIO has the inserts as two large flaps sewn on either end of the diaper that you fold or stack inside the main diaper area.  I find that they make my babies bum even more bulky then the 4.0 diapers and if they aren't stacked just right, they leak like crazy.  Also, when he poops, instead of just having the inside diaper area to rinse, we have those two large flaps as well.  It works out to being five surfaces that need to get sprayed making rinsing these things a major pain in the neck.  And because the ""inserts"" are these flaps and they're permanently attached, they soak up water like crazy when rinsing making for a big sloppy mess when I try to throw them in the washing machine.  It takes us about three times as long to rinse these guys and between that and the leaks and the big puffy bum, I'm overall disappointed in these.  We prefer the bum Genius 4.0 OS diapers.  Even though we have to stuff them every time they're washed, the quick rinsing, the dryness and no leak coverage they provide make them worth the extra 20 seconds it takes us to stuff each one.",0
"This is a great gate for the price!  I purchased this to keep my maltipoo puppy confined out of the den, etc., yet wanted my 4 & 6 year old to be able to come and go as they please.  This gate fits the bill, as it keeps our dog in the kitchen, yet our girls can easily open and close the gate.  For those looking to use this for children, note we don't use the lock feature as it would make it more difficult to open.  I still think they would be able to eventually open it though with some work.  Great gate for a great price!!  Sturdy, nice quality, and would gladly buy another!!",1
"The headband is beautiful at an unbeatable price. I find have to add extra hot glue to better adhere it to the band otherwise it didn't sit right on my baby's head. Also, pay close attention to shipping info. It ships from China with no tracking.",1
Third time's a charm. I got 2 other nursing covers that turned out to be small before seeing this on a friend. The fabric is soft and it covers me and my baby well.,1
"We bought this lock after a similar product from a leading safety company broke down immediately. The lock has been in place for more than 3 months and it doesn't show any signs of wear and tear, even though we use the oven at least 3 times per week. I highly recommend it.",1
The item was purchased as a gift.  I saw these in the gift shop at the hospital where I work and was so excited when I found them on your website.,1
"I put this in at the top of our stairs to keep our blind pooch from falling down the stairs.  Good quality and so far, it works great.  High quality material and easy to install.",1
"Our son and daughter-in-law rate this very high.  When our grandson gets too old for the dangling animals, they are projected on the ceiling.",1
"This nipple help the little drink the milk more smoothly. And the feeding progress is also been shorten. In addition, it recover the quantity of the milk.",1
"its nice and soft, washes well. i recommend to anybody looking for a waterproof crib mattress pad. i wish they would come in different colors :)",1
"I used it for my promenade stroller, its great quality, nice color, very comfy,  very recommended, my baby loves it!",1
My son is two and has not used the toliet yet but we have it out just in case.  He does use it as a step stool.  Looks like a great product and was just what I was looking for.,1
"This set consists of a crib sheet, dust ruffle, small comforter, and a bumper set. It is done in a subtle color combination of chocolate brown, a robin's egg blue, and creamy white. The crib sheet is primarily white with polka dots in the brown and blue color palette. The other three pieces are accented with a tasteful chocolate piping that contrasts with the white background.The construction is superior. When described as having hotel stitching, this is true. The stitching is tight enough to stay in place , but not so taut to snap. The main composition is 200 thread count percale cotton. It has a soft yet sturdy feel to it. I bought a comforter in this fabricaion for my last child and it held up beautifully during its time in service.The overall design is contemporary and could work into virtually any decorating scheme. What I am particularly enthused about is the tailored bed ruffle. I had never seen one like this before, but it is not too fussy.",1
"I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could install this car seat without sustaining injuries to my hands and self-esteem. The locks for securing the seat to the car click onto the metal hook in the car with minimal effort. Even better, the way the lock is designed you don't have to stick your hand into the hidden recesses of the seat. You just push and click. They are even easier to remove by pressing on the button and pulling.The seat belts for the child are just as easy to adjust. The only real question is what to do with the long strap used when the seat is mounted facing backwards. The illustrations show it being hooked to something that may be common in Swedish cars, but seems to be absent in US models. I finally just coiled it up, waiting until my grandson is old enough to sit facing forward.",1
"Three little words... Twelve hour nights. That's how long my 18 month old has slept from 4 weeks of age and I am a firm believer it's because she's sleeping comfortably. I would recommend this to every parent looking for a great quality, lightweight, comfortable crib mattress!",1
The strap broke after one usage. My son literally picked it up to put it on his back and the strap snapped. However it is adorable and the perfect size for my 3 year old to use at preschool. Just wish it was better quality.,0
"I bought this for my two year old daughter for the pool this summer.  We have used it a couple of times already and it works well. She is wearing mostly 3T clothing.  This diaper has a little room to grow, but I wouldn't have bought it any smaller.  She is at the low end of the weight range for this size.  It has a cotton insert (connected) that does absorb pee- unlike many disposable swim diapers.  I must say we haven't had a situation where poop was involved while wearing this diaper, so I cannot comment on that.  It is easy to wash and dry and comes out nice after washing.  I think overall, this is a better option than the disposable swim diapers.  I am happy with the purchase.",1
"I did a lot of research before deciding on prefolds and covers.  Then I did a lot of research on which prefolds and covers.  I went with these because of the great reviews and because they only have two sizes rather than three or four.  We've been using the OsoCozy brand for 8 months and they are wonderful!  We had a pukey baby so while she was in the size ones, we ended up using the size twos as burp cloths.  They worked sooo well.  The diapers are super absorbent and are easy to wash.  I mostly hang them to dry, but occasionally throw them in the dryer to soften them up a little.  She's almost ready to move up to the size twos now, but we've been using them as nighttime diapers for last couple months.  They work and I would definitely recommend them to any parent looking to use cloth diapers!",1
"We bought this a couple of years ago to use for travel, but we ended up using it daily for over a year.Pros: compact, easy to set up, comfortable, inexpensiveCons: When used daily it's difficult to clean out crumbs and food that's become caught in the velcro and the material folds. For this reason, we recently bought a hard plastic booster, but we'll still use this for trips.",1
"I though the comforter would be thicker, but overall I'm happy with the product and quality of the material. it washes well",1
"I first received one as a gift.  My daughter still uses it to fall asleep each night 8 years on.  Since then, I've bought three more as baby shower gifts.",1
"Love this monitor! The first brand of monitor we tried got too much interference from all our wireless technology, the second one didn't have a sensitive enough microphone and didn't pickup our daughter's voice until she was screaming...but this one is GREAT! You can adjust the microphone sensitivity on the back of the baby unit and also adjust the volume on the parent unit.  With the sensitivity on the microphone almost all the way up and the parental unit volume at 3/4 of full volume it's plenty loud and picks up even the slightest cough when our daughter is sleeping! We also have a white sound machine in her room which does come through on the monitor when it's on the highest sensitivity setting, but not at lower microphone sensitivity, the white noise coming through doesn't bother me because I know the monitor is working and I can still hear our baby cough even over the white noise. My husband is a computer geek and our house is full of tech gear, but there is absolutely no interference with the signal and everything always comes across crystal clear! The temperature reading on the parent unit is great since our house has several levels and the temperature varies on each, I always know our baby is comfy in her room! We've been using this for 2 months now with out a problem, hopefully for much longer!",1
"If you've ever cleaned a child carseat, then you know what a big pain that is.  THIS thing is great, not only for potty training, but also to catch food spills, barf, and any number of messes that a small kid makes.  I put one in my car, hubby's car, and in the stroller, but can also be used on high chairs.",1
"Not only does my granddaughter look sweet as pie in this cradle swing, but it does things I never imagined. You start it out as a cradle and just a little turn and it's a swing. Plus all the entertainment! Only one small issue is that it says there are different speeds of swinging, but no matter what speed I set it on, it still swings the same as every other setting. Overall, an excellent and beautiful cradle swing.",1
"I bought this for the main purpose of a walker so that is why I've rated it 2 stars. As an Activity center, it deserves 4 stars, it keeps my son well entertained. However, the wheels on this are hard to push around even for me and my wife. I haven't tried it as a rocker yet but I was very disappointed after spending my money to find out I just might have to buy a separate walker.",0
"Looks cute with the Jacana themed nursery...and additional nice touch.  Good quality, and I'm sure it'll get snuggled with as the baby gets bigger.",1
"To walk through the gate, you must slide a small button and then lift and push the gate.  Sliding the button moves a piece of plastic that is intended to prevent the gate from being lifted and opened.  The piece of plastic is so small, my baby was able to defeat it by just lifting and pushing the gate. My son is only 9 months old and 17 lbs.  We have to make sure the tension is just right to keep this from happening again (Note that our door is 44"" so we are using both extensions, so that could contribute to some of the problems).My other complaint is that the gate will auto-close, but not with enough strength to actually latch back into a locked position.  So, the auto-close function does nothing but get the gate in the way and make it appear the gate is secure when it isn't.That being said, I haven't found a gate yet that is walk-though and able to contain my son.  I'm giving two stars as it works well enough that I'm keeping it, but I don't like it and will never trust it to completely contain my baby.",0
This gate is easy to install and durable.  I've used ours for a couple of years now and it is still holding up great. I really like that my child could see through the gate if I were on the other side.  I'd highly recommend this gate for kids!,1
"this was a gift for my daughter.  Right from the start the baby slept well in it. swaddle the baby, lay him/her on their left side and they sleep like a baby (ha). Wish I had one of these when my kids were babies.",1
"After seeing the pro model in use at the ER at Children's Lurie Hospital in Chicago, I had no doubt that this is money well spent.  This is the fastest and easiest way to diagnose a fidgety child for a fever.  It may not be accurate every time, but it's not difficult to swipe this across a child's head to get multiple readings.",1
"I am very pleased with this product.  My 4-month old has only been taking 20 minute cat-naps and I needed some way to encourage longer sleep during the day.  I thought maybe a background noise would help.  I did a TON of research and review-reading before making this purchase.  I was concerned after reading the reviews about the lack of volume that has been claimed for this product, but have not found this to be an issue at all.  The volume levels are not too soft at all.  In fact, I often worry about it being too loud.  It has a great volume control to fit your needs.  We use the ocean sound, and at first I was worried because one wave sound is louder than the rest, but turning the volume down one notch solved this so it wasn't overbearing.The sounds are fantastic.  My husband likes to play with the blending of various sounds.  There is no break in the repeat of the noises and you cannot tell when the sound is starting its cycle over again, as I have read on so many other sound sleepers.  There is a HUGE variety of sounds as well.  I was impressed.  It has something that should match anyone's needs.It's a huge advantage to have the sound sleeper be battery operated or able to plug into a wall.  It's been a piece of cake to quickly unplug and use it on battery power when my son has fallen asleep in our bedroom or another location.  I love this feature.  We live overseas with the military, and when we vacation we can still take it with us to use on the batteries, since we can't use the plugs here without an adapter/transformer.We love the timer that is on the sound sleeper as well.  We usually let it run on ""on"" until my husband and I go to bed.  Then, when I am going into my son's room to check on him for the last time in the evening, I simply flip the button to timer and an hour later it goes off when we're all asleep.  Love the timer feature.Overall, I'd give this product more than 5 stars if the ratings were higher.  It was a fantastic purchase for very little spent.",1
"i pump exclusively for my little cleft palate girl so i need a good bottle brush. this is it! we had a munchkin brand with a sponge atop harder bristles, but sponge got gross/musty pretty fast and bristles were too hard. this is a soft bristle that works perfectly. storage upright in its own stand is perfect and allows it to air dry-- no must!",1
"My son is 6 months old. We tried swaddling him in the beginning, but he easily wiggled his way out of the blankets every time, or woke himself up trying to kick his legs, something he does a lot in his sleep. We gave up, and got used to him waking up often. He also has a seriously sensitive startle reflex, and very active little hands the minute he's even semi-conscious. Once those hands grab onto something interesting - Boom! It's playtime, not sleep time!So I came across the Woombie and thought, perfect! It could solve a multitude of problems for us - -  IF our son would go for it. Being 6 months old, I thought it might make him crazy being confined all night, and I couldn't find any glowing reviews except from parents of previously swaddled babies. But I went for it anyway, even though my hubby thought it was a crazy, desperate attempt (which it was!). Well, glad I did! Our little guy is still a sort of light sleeper, but having his hands restricted and having the snug feeling of being held all night has resulted in him waking up less and settling easier. He still can kick to his little heart's content, too! So glad I discovered this crazy cocoon!",1
"Keeps my baby nice and warm, is soft and comfortable, and very easy to get on and off.  Great quality materials (zippers, snaps, etc.).",1
"LOVE this bag! We have been using it for 18 months, and it has worked great. I love the interior pockets - they make it easy to find just what is needed. There are two small things that bug me tho:- The side of the strap where it adjusts - the loop always shifts and it is starting to tug at the stitching. Not a deal-breaker, but annoying- The wipes container isn't airtight. When the kiddo was small it wasn't a problem because we used them so fast, but now as he's older, they dry out if not used within a week or two. Now i just keep a travel pack in the bag.Honestly, I'd buy it again in a heartbeat - it was worth every penny.",1
I like the fact that I can take this seat anywhere. It's fairly simple to figure out in the begining. My son loves the toys!,1
"I love this caddy. Super cute. I use it as a diaper caddy on the first floor, because the changing table is on the second story of our home. It holds enough size ones and size fives for a couple of days, plus some wipes, diaper cream, and a folded changing mat. Really helpful and functional.",1
"Okay, so I had an aspirator that I thought was bad so my husband and I bought this one.....and it doesn't work at all! I wanted this one because the tip was smaller for my young baby's nose....but the thing doesn't suck anything out. My poor baby can't breathe : (",0
"I bought this with high expectations. I pumped more milk from the cheap $80 pump that stopped working - but I'm getting enough to feed my baby so it's ok. It's hard to attach the rubber tubes. In fact, one of the tubes is tearing as we speak. Now, what happened is unbelievable. So I am in the middle of putting the pump together. I'm having an issue attaching the tube, as usual. Suddenly, the plastic flange splits in half. I've had this pump for a week. I can't believe it, now I can only pump from one breast while I work. I was expecting quality from a pump the hospital recommends / instead, I have a broken pump. It's also incredibly uncomfortable. Imagine sticking your breast into hard pieces of plastic. Ouch. Unfortunately, their customer service is closed... So I'm going to have to make an emergency stop at Babies r us on the way home hoping they sell parts because I need this by Monday. If I knew this pump was complete junk, I'd have waited an extra week until I got paid to buy the Medela...",0
"I have this mattress protector as the first layer on top of the mattress of the co-sleeper which on its own is a bit stiff.I also bought the plush mattress sheet which I placed over the protector making the co-sleeper mattress extra comfyfor the baby! Babies will have accidents, so I think this is a must!",1
"Let me just say, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!  I used the diaper genie from the time my daughter was born until the time she was 16 months.  That was all I could take.  Constantly buying expensive refills, emptying it every couple of days, juggling a wiggly baby while trying to open, lift, push, spin, and close the genie was just too much.  Then I was shopping at Babies R Us and in the STORE's changing room is the Diaper Champ.  It was easy, didn't smell, and used regular trash bags.  I was sold.After using the Diaper Champ for 2 months now, I am confident I made the right choice.  Yes, when it gets too full, you have to change the bag or the weight will get stuck (duh!).  Yes, if you don't wrap up the poopy wipies in the dirty diaper, you will have to clean poop from the chute (just wrap it up).  Yes, poop does smell (not like roses), but my daughter's room doesn't smell like poop because the Diaper Champ does a great job of containing odor.  You do need to disenfect it when you change the bag, but I would recommend that with any product that is a holding tank for feces (you have to disinfect your toilets, too).I have recommended the Diaper Champ over the genie to every one of my friends.  It is fantastic!!",1
"This valance was very cute, seemed well made and the price and shipping seemed to be reasonable. Shipped fast. However, the baby has no comment one way or another.",1
"I have both the Gia and boppy. I truly prefer the shape of the Gia bc it gives more support while nursing and  allows me to better angle my son who has reflux while nursing. I feel it also provides better support for sitting my son in it. The only downside is the Gia cover. I have a ton if boppy covers that are soft, plush and easy yo take off and put on. The Gia cover doesn't have a zipper and is a very tight fit like a snoogle pregnancy pillow. Other than that , I love the Gia",1
"Our daughter is 19 months and will soon be sharing a room with her newborn brother.  She loves the monkey theme and the colors and patterns are nice and neutral.  We bought the crib set for the baby, but I am now back looking a set for her crib as well.",1
"Just what I ordered, will do exactly what it says so I give it a good review! Yes I would recommend this to others as well!",1
these are super well made and my son loves them. however..........they are kinda short. they need to be like 5 inches longer. he can only chew/reach them if he is very close to my chest. there just isn't enough slack. he still likes them and I'm glad we got them. its just that sometimes they can be worn we have to just give them to him.,1
"This is the type of thing that I think appeals to the adults looking at it but not so much the baby playing with it.  There aren't enough toys in reach at any given time and the prime spot, directly overhead, are out of reach altogether.  The ""glass"" part of the mirror fell out.  The monkey is attached by a curled tail and it came out as soon as a little hand tugged on it even a tiny bit.  Most importantly it didn't stay connected.  Instead of the ""legs"" staying in position by a hook like I've seen on other (more simple) baby gyms, they snap in at the top.  One of them stopped staying in, every time we moved the gym it fell out, and it was annoying as heck.  As soon as my son outgrew it (when he began crawling) we got rid of it.  At this price I'd like to see an item like this, that gets used for such a short period of time, last at least through two kids.For baby #2 we used a much, much simpler one, the Bright Starts RRRoaring Fun! Play Gym.  It's out of production now but I'm sure there are similar items.  No music or lights but plenty of what baby wants.  I've been thinking my son (#1) wasn't ""into"" the baby gym and that my daughter (#2) is, but now I'm wondering if it was the Rainforest gym he wasn't into.",0
"I purchased this as a present for my son's first birthday.  He has a fascination with tags, as most children do, so he took to this stuffed animal immediately.  He sleeps with him every night!",1
"It works. It's simple to install, and it even keeps me out when i forget it's on! I love it.",1
"The SippiGrip looks great and works well for keeping that sippy cup off the ground! I love all the different designs and the adjustable velcro. I was afraid it would slide around on the sippy cup, but once it's attached it's basically immovable. This and the Baby Buddy Secure-a-Toy are a mum's best friends!",1
"This is a really cute coat, but its huge... I ordered a 0-3 month and this looks like it could fit a well over 12 month old.... Crazy!!! Be aware of this!",0
"We just purchased this stroller for our son who is just turning a year old. We wanted something lightweight and stylish as we just stopped using our heavy double stroller. This stroller is lightweight, under 12 pounds. We also really liked the look and color scheme. However, this stroller is almost impossible to collapse. You have to push down on this button and pull on this handle simultaneously. It was so hard to get it to release that my husband even had a lot of diffficulty closing it! The worst part was the back support for the child. It has a hard support piece behind the back that is curved within the material, and it made our son sit hunched over and he couldn't really sit with his back straight. He seemed so uncomfortable that after using it a couple of times, we have decided to get rid of it. I would definitely look into a different brand/stroller.",0
Better then disturbing your baby. This way you don't have to disturb your infant but just place the baby in carseat into stroller,1
I don't think it's fair to give this a bad review because you disagree with the premise. The product does it's job fine. It protects an iPhone or iPod touch really well. It looks cute and is not too expensive comparatively to other products.The apps it comes with are really simple and very appropriate for babies and there are other apps you can download for babies too. You can also use it and play music on your phone or a movie. It can come in very handy. It's hard to avoid letting your little one play with the phone sometimes so you might as well protect it. Other parent friends have expressed interest in getting one for themselves.,1
"Got this crib set for our little guy who will be here soon. Nice, quality materials, vivid colors, good value. The one issue we had was tying the crib bumper. We have a standard size crib, a Bedford Baby Monterey, and besides being difficult to tie, the bumper is way too long. It is not snug at all like recommended and therefore not very safe for the baby. Now I wish I just got the separate pieces from this set, not including the bumper (although it is a very cute one).",1
"This seems to by my infants sons favorite pacifier - and the only one I don't seem to lose :) It's easy to find, when digging through the diaper bag, or spot, in the house. Love it. Highly recommend.",1
"These have saved my back. I was getting a lot of pain from hunching over for breastfeeding and pumping. The angle allows me to lean back further. They also do seem to be more effective at grabbing the breast tissue, like others have said. They're expensive but totally worth it!",1
"These cards are really cute. They're the perfect size for a thank-you card and reasonably priced.  They're not the highest quality cardstock, but you get what you pay for.  I ordered two of these card sets to use as thank-yous for my baby shower; one set was great, the other was missing one card (9 cards and 10 envelopes).  I probably should have returned them, but I needed them immediately.  So make sure you count your cards!",1
"i read a review that said &#34; its works just as good as a fork&#34; not it doesn't, i works much more better than a fork, much more..., it mashes the food real good, and actually does what its supposed to do, it very easy to clean, a simple wash gets all the dirts out.",1
"We had this given as a gift for our daughter, and it works great. She has used it to put herself to sleep since she was a couple months old. She is 3 now and we finally decided to replace the set. with new ones.(they are still fine but a bit faded.)Having 3 is perfect for us, we keep 1 at her daycare and 1 at home, and 1 spare. The actual blankets are soft and are great for little hands.We loved this so much we bought a green triceratops one for our son. Good buy.",1
"It does the trick for now but as my daughter gets older (currently 13 months) and stronger, I think she'll be able to push it open/over.  Pressure mount gates will never be great, period.  BUT...it's nice to have something that doesn't require permanent drilling and holes.",0
My nephew (8 months old) just LOVES this musical toy! It was a great gift! Especially with the price I paid for it!,1
"We bought this extra camera since we have 2 rooms where our child sleeps. From the monitor, it has full control of tilt and rotate of the camera. The night vision is great in that the room can be nearly dark and you can still see your child. Of course it has a microphone so you can hear any crying or whimpering in the crib through the unit. This additional camera pairs very easily with your existing MBP36 monitor and works seamlessly!",1
"I have been using strollers for more than ten years now. I bought this stroller after my youngest child's Maclaren was damaged on a plane flight. I would have liked to replace it with another one but where I live now, they are unavailable. I managed to find this one in the major Asian city where I live. We are city dwellers and walk ALOT and everyday. We take the subway and walk up & down stairs often (since many of our stations do not have escalators or elevators). I dislike this stroller so much that after only three months, I am looking to replace it. The sun shade is constantly popping off of the stroller frame. Every time I want to close it, I have to stop, hold both sides, open it, then pop it at least once back on the frame. Once it is down, it stays nicely, but it is a headache to do. It is not a one handed folding stroller. It was designed to be, but in practice, it doesn't happen. I am often popping in and out of taxis and it is not a fast, smooth transition in and out. You could not be holding a sleeping baby and open this one and no way could you close it one handed. And it doesn't lock closed easily either. I always have to give it and extra push to make sure it latches. Already the tips of both foot breaks have broken off (still operable) and just today a side latch that locks the stroller when folded, broke off. It is also not a lightweight stroller. My Maclaren was much lighter and just easier to manage up and down stairs. The baskets held about the same amount, but the Maclaren held the stuff better and when full was much better balanced. When the basket on this one is full, it is heavy and awkward and very difficult to carry up and down (not to mention stuff often slides out the top). This stroller would probably be fine for the suburbs where you had a lot of space, a lot of room to put it in the back of your car, didn't have to carry it up and down places or put it on and off of a train. This is not a good city stroller at all! It is also very difficult to tilt the stroller up over curbs. The Maclaren was a breeze. My two older boys (10 & 8) loved to push their three year old brother in the Maclaren. They HATE pushing him in the Peg Perego. IT is too difficult for them to steer and push. They can hardly tilt him up the curb. In contrast, they had no problems tilting him up in the Maclaren. It is the way the weight is distributed in the Peg Perego that makes it difficult. It is also difficult to manage it up and down escalators for this same reason. This stroller does have a nice tray, it is easy to get my child in and out and it reclines pretty far back. The Maclaren didn't do this. This sunshade also covers more than my Maclaren, but the one I am looking at replacing this one with looks like it covers a lot more than my original Maclaren. The Maclaren is a true lightweight stroller.The thing that frustrates me the most about this stroller is how it just does not live up to the quality that it should. It is just cheap with a few quality features. But overall it is cheap and not long lasting. It will probably do you fine for the first year or two of your child's life, but this is not a long term, long-lasting stroller. And for three hundred dollars, this should last you the duration of, at minimum, one child. It is a disappointment. My Evenflo from 1998 did a much better job than this stroller. MUCH. Nothing ever broke on that stroller and I loaded it with groceries, at times pushed two children in it, it reclined very nicely and I think that price point (yes ten years ago) was only $120-ish including infant car seat! If you think this is a quality stroller, give a Maclaren or other high quality stroller a spin and you may just change your mind!",0
"Initially, I bought this medicine dispenser to give my baby the Colic Calm, but it also proved itself good at pediatrician's office, where the nurse used it to give my little one the rotavirus vaccine, and that's what we use every time we go in for boosters. It is fairly easy to clean and I strongly recommend it.",1
i recently purchased gate to keep the dogs confined to the down stairs. Plus i figure with my baby growing it will be needed to keep him safe.i like the way the gate looks especially if you need the full length plus assembly is really quite simple. However there are two major things i find disappointing hence the three stars. First off the gate to pass through is very narrow so if you have to carry something be careful. Second is they don't account for whether or not you have baseboard or trim where you are placing the gate. If where you set the tension on the bottom was a little higher perhaps going through the first horizontal bar this would alleviate that. As it is if i raise it past the trim then i have the concern of it being a tripping hazard. Had i known this i may have considered a different brand,0
"Exactly what I wanted.  Solid but can fold down if needed.  Would prefer greater colour options, but otherwise very good product.",1
"Was a gift for granddaughter, she is totally in love with her Blabla doll Kit.  Great product for early childhood development.",1
"Not really thrilled with these; they seem to repel water.  I thought after washing many times it would stop, but they still do it after two months of use (wash every other day).  I bought these along with organic OsoCozy flannel wipes and I must say those work far better.  I still use them, but will not be buying any more.",0
This potty seemed like a great idea for on the go potty needs but.... it is too small! My daughter is tall but petite for a 2 year old. She cannot get comfortable on the tiny seat so after a couple of failed attempts she refuses to use it. I read the other reviews commenting on the size and wish that I would have listened to them. I decided to get a regular potty chair to keep in my trunk but use the potette liners with it.,0
It is easy to use. I think we made the right choice! Fisher price never disappoints us. Go for it.,1
"Great food storage containers! On the side they even have a scale showing ml, oz so you know how much food is in them. They seal perfectly and they're easy to clean.",1
"Exactly as it is described! Perfect for my little boys room, we just ordered the long panel curtains to go with it. Thank you!",1
"We love this swing, it was easy to assemble, our baby boy seems to like it so far. But there is one annoying thing about it. All gears except for the first make an annoying sound when swinging, especially when gearing up. Not a dealbreaker, but please Papasan Team... fix it in the next version!",0
"Like the title says, I wish they made these in a soft cloth or crinkle fabric.  Nevertheless, my son's attention is caught by these.  I especially like the book that allows you to insert pictures of the family and friends your baby encounters often!",0
Great extra seat to leave at the grandparents house or to take on short trips. Takes up little room and does the job. My daughter seems to like this seat. No complaints about it.,1
"First of all, these things are like a giant square of gauze with some cotton stuffed in the middle. Everytime baby pees or poos it soaks right through everytime. They dont last long either. I have washed them several times and already there are rips. I recomend buying these only if you are wanting to try out cloth diapering as a beginner, not for long term use. if you find you like it then you can pitch these and buy a good quality chinese prefold. I persoally dont think they feel very comfortable, they are rather stiff.",0
"I typically use the take and toss sippy cups for my daughter...but she tends to be lazy at times and doesn't tilt the cup back to use it. Because of that I saw these sippy cups and got excited because it seemed like the ideal solution to the issue at hand. While it took care of the need to tilt as much, that ease just creates a new issue of it spilling everywhere when tilted to the side or upside down. The take and toss at least are somewhat spill resistant, these cups are most definitely not. Because of them spilling so easily I don't really use them at all anymore and reverted back to using the take and toss cups I was previously using.",0
"These are excellent wrist rattles.  With these rattles kids can't throw them on the ground every two minutes so they're entertaining without causing parents to pick them up all the time.  The animals are very cute and give kids something to chew on as well as shake.  This is great for kids who love to crawl, roll, or toddle around since they'll enjoy the noise as they're moving around.  And if your little one likes these you may want to check outInfantino Foot Rattlesas well.",1
"I don't like these.Pros:1. These are very easy to install. Simply press into place.2. Color blends in well with the outlet.3. Very cheap (price, that is...see below for quality problems)Cons:1. If you have fingers bigger than the average 6 year-old, good luck getting these off when you need to. You either need to use a screwdriver to pry a corner while pushing the center ""push tab"", or tear your fingers up with extreme pressure.2. You have to be a master at ""Twister - the Hand Version"" to get these off. Push tab serves no purpose. It was SUPPOSED to add leverage to allow you to use one-hand to slide it out of the socket, but I always end up doing the following:A: Using my right hand's thumb and middle finger, grip the sides.B: Using my left hand's thumb, reach up in-between my right hand's death-grip and push hard on the center push  leverC: Using my left hand's pointer finger, reach over and down, in-between my right hand's grip, and pull at the top of the plugD: Apply steady, painful pressure on all points, until my fingers start to hurt, or it comes off3. Little fingers can more easily wiggle their points into the protector, kind of defeats the purpose...Overall: I DON'T LIKE IT - 2 STARSAvoided one star because of the price...I shouldn't have cheaped-out on these, spend a few more dollars, and gotten better ones. Caveat Emptor.",0
The bedding is exactly as pictured and perfect for my toddler!  I have no complaints at all and the price and quality can't be beat!,1
Received two of these items  ran then both for about 30 min. One started to smell like an electric fire and over heated and stoped working. Dont waste your money.,0
"My 16mo. old was totally over sitting in his high chair.  After reading the reviews we ordered this booster and it is perfect.  The settings to raise and lower are easy and handy.  It is well priced and works perfectly.  The colors are pretty bad and like everyone else said waaaay too many stickers that all say the same thing, but what the heck it was $12 and we will use the heck out of it.",1
"This toy looks much better than it is. The product description reads like it is more than it is. I was disappointed for a few reasons. First, the magnets are so weak. They can hardly stay on. Also, the two sides of the pieces are the same with opposite polarity. I wish they had different designs so kids can learn about the two effects of magnetism.The bear's head is cute, but it is quite small and is easily lost.A great idea over the usual ring post toy, but this design needs some improvements.",0
"I bought this initially for bottles and such. However it works great for all kinds of other things such as medicine droppers, medicine cups, the parts to my french press, cookie cutters, and so on. It's even a great place to set the sponge to dry out so that it doesn't stay moist and start to stink. It's big enough that I can fit a good amount of things on it, but small enough that it doesn't take up a whole lot of space. No more trying to hand dry bottle pieces or little things that hold water in... it all drains out with this thing and then you can take it apart and throw it in the dishwasher for cleaning!",1
These filters are hard to find locally but my order here was filled and delivered to my home in about 7 days. Excellent turnaround and product.,1
"This was perfect to extend our gate. Even though the original gate was purchased 7 years ago, I was pleased to see the quality and craftsmanship has not changed. We had no issues installing it and it does the job well.",1
"My son would not take the avent, nuk, playtex brand pacis.  all other pacis are pretty much the same.  he only wanted his mama. a friend gave me a Mexican honey filled paci and he loved it but it freaked me out.  no one else seemed to mind (we are all mexicans) i was determined to find one similar to that one and this was it.  I also love the European standards.  Worth the $9.",1
"We are very happy with this booster seat.  Started training our baby girl to sit at the table with us when she was about four months old and she took to this very well.  We had to prop her up a bit with some rolled up towels on the sides, since she likes to lean over and watch our dog underneath her.  The trays pop right off after feedings and we just run them under hot water with some soap or use wipes and they're like new.  Same with the seat.  Only thing that's hard to clean are the white straps, but not a big deal.",1
"They work great, without breaking the budget!  Just make sure you have screws on hand cause we had to make a home depot trip since enough weren't provided.",1
my baby loved this mirror so much! it was adorable to set it on the ground for tummy time and watch him find his reflection and then laugh and smile at himself! stays up well until bumped,1
"It's a nice sling, easy to get baby in and out. An adjustable sling, though more work might be a better way to go. Generally though, happy with the product.",1
This was a good product but my son discovered it at 1 year and ripped it off the entertainment center so..... just judge it based on your childs personality.  Mine destroys everything.  It was great until that point though,0
"Although very difficult to install forward facing, it was totally worth the effort! Very secure and seems comfortable. My daughter loves it. Straps adjust easily.",1
The length of this surfboard bib coverrs my little one from neck to toes so there is no way he can spit up on his outfit. It is made of a nice absorbant terry cloth so it soft on his face.,1
"I had a terrible time shopping for bottles before the birth of my son. The reviews of most bottles are mixed or bad, and I simply couldn't pick one out. Now that my son is 5 months old, I have tried a few out, and I have come to love these bottles.The advantage of these bottles is that they are glass. The majority of the plastic bottles on the market now are designed to be BPA-free. The plastic used to make them BPA-free is flimsy. Extra parts need added to make the bottle sturdy enough to attach a nipple to the bottle. Like many of the reviewers of the plastic bottles, I have found they leak easier. The extra parts are not desirable to clean or store. These glass bottles are sturdy, don't leak, and don't have the extra parts.I was worried that these bottles, in particular the 8-oz bottles, would be heavy. I have not had a problem with that. Also, a concern may be that they are not wide-base. The advantage of a wide-base bottle is, due to the larger diameter, it is easier to pour formula into it. I don't have much problem with that either. After some time, I am not sure when, I became a whiz at making bottles. I find it advantageous that the diameter for the nipples is standard, as opposed to wide-base, as other standard-sized nipples or caps can fit on it. (When pregnant and shopping, I also had trouble trying to figure out what nipples fit on what bottles. Mostly there is standard-size and then wide-base. As long as a bottle is not ""wide-base,"" it is probably standard and you can, in theory anyway, mix and match it. Just FYI to soon-to-be moms who may have the same questions as I had.)The trick to making these work is to buy the appropriate flow-rate nipple for your child's age. If pregnant, buy the slow (0-3 month) rate for immediate use but also buy the medium (3-6 month) and the faster nipples right away. Then you have them and there is no lag in switching to them when you need to; YES your baby will grow FAST.I was disappointed however that the different flow-rate nipples for these bottles are not CLEARLY marked as being slow, medium, or fast. For me, a clear indicator on the nipples, the way Avent does by clearly marking the nipples ""1"", ""2"", or ""3,"" would make these bottles better.Also, the venting on the Even Flo nipples is not as good as some other nipples--but not terrible. When feeding, we break the suction semi-routinely to release air. As a comparison, NUK nipples had a vent at the base of the nipple. It was a hole well below where the baby's mouth is such that the baby's mouth does not cover the hole and it clearly let air out. Those nipples worked well to not build up air, but I do not find that the NUK nipples fit as well on the Even Flo bottles as the Even Flo nipples so I use the Even Flo nipples.To make formula, I have learned to tip the bottle upside down and at an angle, while simply putting my finger over the hole in the nipple, and shaking. Being upside down and at an angle seems to shake the formula from all directions and so it is mixed quickly and easily.The only disadvantage of glass is you most likely won't be able to take it to daycare. I used Avent bottles, again getting the proper flow-rate nipples, because that seemed to be what most other parents used and I wanted it to be easy for the caregivers at daycare to use and assemble them.Highly recommend!",1
"I have a 2.5 month old daughter.  I was using the Primo bath tub to bathe her; however, it was a pain holding her up with one hand while bathing her with the other.  The primo tub is huge!  Also, I had to be on my knees next to the bath tub. This tub is very secure when placed over the kitchen sink.  I don't really have to hold her up.  It's easy to store too because it's pretty small.",1
Love these swaddles but the swaddles are very different sizes despite being labeled as the same size. The apples one will likely fit up to the claimed 14 lbs but the ivory one is so much smaller and my 10 lb baby barely fits in it already. Weird.,0
"This was the perfect seat for us. I'm posting this mostly because I had a heck of a time researching seats that would fit in the Clubman so I hope this helps other parents who want to hold onto their Clubmans!(For reference, I have the &#34;3-door&#34; Mini Clubman and it's a teensy bit bigger than the 2-door Cooper.)This seat was actually somewhat easy to install (via LATCH), but I didn't like how much it wiggled, so I had it checked by the State Police and it was fine. (I was being over cautious.) It takes up more room than the infant carrier did, but a passenger can still sit comfortably in front.The 3rd door on the Clubman is on the passenger side and there's enough space to get my average sized 17 month old toddler in and out of this seat in the back without any problems.The Clubman also has a split back seat and I keep the driver's side of the back seat folded down most of the time. There's plenty of space left for another car seat in the back seat as well.My only complaint about this seat is that the chest strap requires 2 hands to unhook.",1
"This backpack is so cute I can hardly stand it. But be warned that it is definitely a backpack made for toddlers, not really for school-age children. I use it mainly to cart around my 2 year-old son's toys and books in my car in case I need to keep him entertained somewhere but there is not a whole lot of room in the backpack.",1
This cloths are great! Exactly what I need them for! Fabric it's soft and I use them all the time! Very durable,1
My husband and I have been very pleased with the quality and ease of use of this gate. Would definitely recommend! :),1
"I cannot say enough good things about this gate.  My husband and I have a fireplace with a brick hearth that sits at an angle in our living room which made it difficult to figure our the best way to protect our new baby from hurting herself on it.  We have pets which would chew any type of foam protection, so that was out.  I had concerns about the magnet lock until I reviewed the video of this item and saw that it was a pull back latch PLUS a magnet.  I am so glad I ordered it as it is absolutely perfect.  My husband got it installed in about 25 minutes and that includes shaping and everything.  I cannot recommend this product enough to any parent/grandparent/babysitter who has a fireplace with hearth.",1
"I love the pitcher. Granted you can go out and buy a typical iced tea container with a mixing plunger but I just bought this instead. At the moment I make five 6oz bottles. That's about all I'll make at one time, plus that's all my son eats in one day anyway at the moment. If you make more than that some formula will splash out the sides. I figure if and when my son starts eating more I won't care if I have to fill the pitcher up again because it has cut my bottle making time in half and that's all I care about!I will agree with some of you who said the handle likes to fall off when it's not supposed to.  It's supposed to come off.. It comes off for easy cleaning purposes. But it comes off when you don't want it to.The only thing I would change about it is making the size bigger. I knew how big it was before buying. I think you can mix up to 36oz? But just remember, when using formula you always end up with more ounces because of the powder. So I can't really see myself mixing 36 ounces without making a small mess with it overflowing from pushing the mixing plunger to mix the formula.Still.. I love it!",1
"I love the fact that it has a little hole at the bottom where the water comes out so that water doesn't just pool at the bottom.  I love the bubble bath dispenser as well.  It does take a little bit of adjusting getting on the faucet, but I LOVE this!  So does my 11-month old baby.",1
"The review by a previous customer was very helpful as it is difficult to tell the difference between various books when searching online. Wish the sellers would give a better description of what is in each book, but this book is great and I am very pleased with my purchase. Covers milestones from birth to 5 with extra pages in the back to add extra personalized pages. Great to purchase before babe comes so everything can be included in the book (ie: hand and foot prints taken at the hospital, newspaper headlines from the day baby is born, etc.).",1
"Even thoough, I like seeing our newborn, it is not worth the money.  We have nothing but problems, every night I put the monitor on and it is either fuzzy or the pictue keeps flipping over and over. I think the idea is great, however if they are going to charge so much for it, they need to come up with something better.",0
"This is the cup for you!I did quite a bit of research on these cups before purchasing.  I was a bit confused and had second thoughts about them after reading some reviewers complaints about leaking.  These reviewers are mistaken.  They need to take the time to properly read the instructions and insert all pieces.  This sippy cup is a superior product. It has multiple pieces, that when assembled properly, form a natural vacuum.  The vacuum allows my child to labor less and enjoy more... without spilling a drop!My 1 year old likes to tap and bang her cup on things.  She has been able to create quite a mess with other cups.  This item does not allow a single drop to leave, even after she removes it from her mouth and waves it in the air.Don't let the price or bogus reviews discourage you, this item is the one for you!PS-Amazon shipped two of them separately, charging me more and wasting lots of materials...shame on Amazon!  Amazon, please re-think your shipping policies!",1
"Purchased this item for a co-worker perfect for her needs- pattern was beautiful and all was easy to put together,",1
My son loves it. It is comfortable and very nice looking.  It is a very good quality bedspread and sheets.,1
"This item is a little small for my growing 13 year old boy's lunch but all in all it's very well made.  The lid has deep indentations that sort of trough so it's important to pre-soak in hot, sudsy water to make sure no particles of chili, soup or casserole still are lurking.Did find a larger one at Ikea for a better price, but this is still a good item. Seems to be fairly indestructible.",1
Item arrived on time and is as described. We'll use it to make a double-strap backpack to carry the carseat when traveling.,1
"I just bought this high chair for my 10 month old, and it's great!  The ONLY issue I have is that my daughter leans back a bit too much in it's most upright position. For now, I have to put a folded blanket behind her so she sits up a bit straighter. I'm sure that when she gets bigger, it'll be perfect though. I love that the tray has a dishwasher safe insert you can just pop out. She hasn't figured out how to get it off yet, so that is good! Fabric is really comfy and washable--and cute!",1
"It was great for 1.5 month and then it lost its waterproof quality, the water spread through the indicative panel one day and that was the end of it.",0
"I bought this cover so that I would be able to read my kindle on the beach. I have not been to the beach yet, but so far, from what I can tell just by going outside in the sun, it works pretty good!  I'm excited to be able to read my books on it at the beach next week!",1
"I use these bins to store diapers under my daughter and son's changing tables, and they work very well. I didn't notice on the description, but the separators in the bin are removable, so you can have sections or just one big bin to put all your things into. This is a nice feature.",1
"I bought these for my son to have around the house. They're even less spill-proof than the take and toss ones. They drip constantly if you turn them upside down. They're also hard to close; I have had them spill all over when my child grabs it from the top because it's not closed properly.They are functional, but that's about it. I mostly use them w/o the lids now.",0
"I bought 2 of these chairs for my twins. I love that they hook onto the counter so the twins feel like they are right there with everyone else when we eat. I love to have them face me when I am busy in the kitchen. Then I can turn them away from the counter to feed them. We get compliments all the time about them. HOWEVER, here are my complaints: They are a bit of a pain to clean. They are easy to remove but are supposed to be hand washed and dried. I have put them in the washer without problem but I don't dare to put them in the dryer. So I have to try to remember to wash them at night so they are dry in time for breakfast. But my BIGGEST complaint about them is that in order to buckle them in securely, their back has to be snug against the back of the chair. And the buckle just comes up through the legs and around the waist. It will not hold a squirmy child. I guess my twins are smaller than most kids because if they are against the back, they can't reach the tray very well. Plus, they spill food all over themselves. We usually just stuff old towels behind them to tighten the space because they can climb right out of the buckles. A few days ago, one of the twins fell out and broke her leg. I do love lots of things about the chairs but I wish there was a better way to secure the child.",0
"I gave this as a christening gift to a family member - very sweet.  It is  well-made, soft and seems like it will be durable.",1
I don't care what my friends say.  I do not need to spend $20 on a diaper from an american company for them to be good diapers.  I have used Alva for the last 2 years with my baby and have had no more leaks or blowouts than anyone I know using the more expensive American brands.,1
"We have used this with our almost 3 year old since birth. It has several sounds options, most I think you'll never use. The mp3 option is nice & works great with an iPod nano because it fits in the bottom compartment even closed. It has a blue night light option, but also puts off a little light just when playing sounds. The buttons click a little loud if you're adjusting when baby is already asleep. Only real complaint is power cord connection no longer holds tight so it has to be taped or placed just right so it doesn't fall out. This can be really frustrating when baby is asleep & then you have to search for the plug & reset the sound & volume you want in the dark.",0
"This is my first Amazon product review--the Lansinoh mOmma worked so well under desperate circumstances that I felt compelled to let other parents know.Our exclusively breastfed 11-week-old daughter took to the Lansinoh mOmma with two weeks to spare before I had to go back to work. We had tried several different standard, wide-neck ""breastfeeding"", and orthodontic silicone nipples (Tommee Tippee, Comotomo, Avent Natural, Breastflow, Nuk, and Dr. Brown's). She latched on the mOmma right away--she took 2 oz. with her first feeding (some fussing), 3 oz. with her second feeding (minimal fussing), and 4 oz with her third feeding (no fussing, and even fell asleep as she would at my breast!).We first introduced a bottle at 5 weeks, but the most she would take from the first two bottles we tried (Tommee Tippee and Avent) was 1 oz. We wish we had tried the mOmma first, as it would have saved us both the cost of assembling a bottle 'collection' and the worry that feeding would be difficult for her caregivers.We observed two problems that the above mentioned silicone nipples posed for our baby: 1) The nipple would slide around in her mouth; or 2) The nipple was so long that she would gag on it. Both prevented her from latching properly. I should mention that we did not try latex nipples--some parents on the Nuk bottle reviews cited success with this as softer and grippier, and it would have been our next try had the mOmma not worked.The three features that distinguishes the mOmma from other bottles is 1) the shorter and smaller nipple which gently slopes to a wide base; 2) the matte area around the base of the nipple which encourages proper latching; and 3) the short, round bottle shape. We observed that our baby did not gag on this nipple like other longer and wider ones, and that the matte part of the silicone allowed her lips to grip on to the base and prevent the nipple from sliding around. The bulbous bottle shape allows my husband to get a good angle and close hold for feeding.We also found mOmma's air vent system to work well and prevent excess gas, unlike the Nuk orthodontic nipple bottle (the second best bottle she took to). The silicone nipple is soft (unlike the Tommee Tippee, Avent Natural, and Comotomo) and so far seems durable. It truly has a slow-flow nipple (unlike the Avent Natural which caused our daughter to cough and gag)--when you hold it upside down, it either doesn't drip or drips sparingly. The wide-mouth bottle shape is easy to clean--you don't need a bottle brush, just a sponge cut into 1/4 and dishwashing soap of your choice.Some critics here have complained about the lip near the bottle thread preventing all the milk from entering the tip, leading to waste. While we agree that the lip is annoying and could be redesigned a la Comotomo's seamless shape, my husband found that it was not difficult to unlatch and then relatch her to get all the milk into the nipple reservoir. Other critics have cited that it is difficult to measure ounces on the bottle. While it is true that the ounce marks are clear and could be more visible, I use my Ameda pump storage bottles to measure ounces--it has never been a problem. A third criticism I've read is that the bottle shape does not fit some bottle warmers--we use the Kiinde Kozii and it fits the mOmma with no problem. If the mOmma doesn't fit one's existing bottle warmer, one could use either pump bottles or breastmilk storage bags and transfer it into the mOmma.These minor drawbacks aside, given that we were starting to make plans to have a caregiver spoon or dropper-feed her when I returned to work and see a Lactation Consultant for help, we are THRILLED overall with the mOmma and would highly recommend it to other 'panicked' parents. Give this innovative bottle a try early on!",1
"We've used about four different brands of pacifier clips, and these are the best. The clip mechanism is easy to use and durable. The part that you loop around the pacifier is the perfect length-the Ulubulu pacifier clip loop is shorter and harder to use. The length of the fabric is also perfect. We have about four of these clips and love them!",1
These guards are high quality and provide the protection we need for our active grandchildren.  I would recommend them to anyone.,1
"This has been the nicest swing.  I also used a Graco and when the baby got tired his head slumped to the side and hit the support bar when the swing was going back and forth.  This one cradles his head beautifully (and that hair rubbing off issue that has been mentioned is something that happens to a lot of babies at 3 months or so - Jack's hair rubbed off in the crib as he moved his head and most of the rest fell out, but at maybe 5 months it grew back.  The swing didn't do it to him).  He sleeps so well in this, so I can shower or do other work.  Now that he's 21 lbs the swing motor has to work harder - the front to back swing position works better than side to side because his heavy head can slow the swinging if it's to one side.  He has grabbed the animals so many times really hard and has never broken the mechanism (you can turn the mobile off so that it is out of baby's reach).  It is true that no matter how wide you push the legs, one seems to lift a tiny bit when it swings (on hardwood floor), but I don't put it above 2 speed.  The Graco also seemed to have only a very fast swing that did not relax him, whereas this Papasan is perfect.  He loves the mirror as well.  I attach toys to the tray to give him more to play with.",1
"This works great.  I am afraid I don't use it as often as I though, but when I do, it does the job great!",1
"My daughter is expecting in a month so I wanted to try this system for monitoring the baby when she's visiting.  We tried it on our 7 year-old grandson and love it.It's versatile, easy to use, and will provide needed oversight while saving steps and not disturbing the baby.The monitoring system was very easy to set up and install.  I charged the battery of the parent unit for the suggested time, placed the baby and parent unit in the desired location and it is working great.I am impressed by the video quality for both day and night time use. I was surprised at how clear the picture was, even though the units were stationed on different levels of the house. The zoom and pan features are nice for watching an active child or baby.The audio quality is very good in that I can clearly hear my grandson if he needed to talk to us while in his bedroom.  However, the voice quality when I try to communicate with him through the microphone is just okay.  He couldn't always understand what I we were saying, so we had to repeat ourselves. However, this may just be a matter of becoming accustomed to the sound.This monitoring system has been helpful in saving steps. We could use the microphone to remind my grandson when it is time to stop reading and go to sleep. The monitor allowed us to adequately see and communicate with him, providing a welcome sense of security.We haven't tested the baby sensor component but plan to when the baby arrives. I know that it'll give me some peace of mind knowing that I can continually monitor her without having to constantly enter her room and risk waking her up.I would definitely recommend this baby system to all parents for monitoring babies and kids in general.",1
this was exactly what i needed as an extra base for a second car. already had the carseat/stroller set /,1
Great for traveling and just any where you want to be hands free. Took a little getting used to at first but once I got the hang of it I loved it!!!,1
"Our family has been in search of a quality infant video monitor for some time now, and this product definitely isn't it. After only four months of use the product seemed to short out one afternoon when we used our microwave and the receiver was within about five feet of it. Since that time the receiver has been finicky as to when it will work or not.The temperature display is clear to read and we appreciated the color-changing screen as the temperature became too warm or too cold, however it often will change up and down as much as 4 degrees as you are watching it.Lastly, I'm not impressed with the volume control. I like to sleep with the receiver near my bed at night, but even on the lowest setting the volume is way too loud. I end up putting the whole receiver in my bedside table drawer so that my husband and I can still hear the baby but it doesn't scare us half-to-death when he cries out.I will say the video clarity is very good and we love the fact you can switch between two different cameras, but we'll definitely be looking for something else. Major bummer of a purchase.",0
"These were a big hit at my little one's first birthday party.  The hat was adorable!  It didn't stay on long, but it was nice while it lasted.",1
SO FAR SO GOOD HOPE THEY HOLD UP  THE BABY LOVES THEM  I WOULD RECOMEND THEM TO ALL WITH NEW BABYS,1
"I bought this for my second daughter. My first daughter had a bouncy seat that was pretty much useless. She didn't seem to sit in it well, it was stiff. This one has a great concave shape. My baby was cradled in it and I didn't feel like I had to have the belt on to simply hold her in. It looks comfy. It has beautiful colors. The material is soft. The head rest and inside layer easily remove for washing. The entire thing can be fairly easily removed to wash if needed (I have done this multiple times and it still looks great). The slightly upright position allowed her to sleep easier when she went through a gassy spit up stage.The overhanging toys come off to be washed if needed. The entire arc pushes back and even easily removes which was a nice feature. The bouncer plays music (two different volumes which I feel entertained my older daughter more than my baby) and has a vibrating feature. That was great. Quickly soothed my daughter. It also bounced nicely either by hand or my foot if I was trying to do something else.Overall I am so glad I spent the money on this bouncer and wish I had it for my second child.Update: I recently pulled this bouncer back out of my basement so I could babysit a friends children. I bought it almost three years ago. It still works great, washed up well, and is invaluable again. It was worth every penny.",1
we got this for a peti couldn't figure it out at firstmy husband got ituse it everyday/nightsnice and lightfast to open and put right back up again,1
"When my son was first born, he cried every time we used a wipe on him...he hates the cold wipes.  We bought the warmer and the crying stopped.  To this day, he HATES us using any wipes that didn't come out of the warmer.  So, this has been a real life saver.The only drawbacks are:(1) The temperature in the warmer could be a a tad bit higher so that the wipes stay warm a little longer.2)  You have to remember to add water to the unit and change the pad on a fairly regular basis.  This isn't a big deal at all, as long as you do it regulary.  But, when you're a new mom, it's easy to forget.Even with the drawbacks I listed above, I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone.  In fact, I've bought a number of these for family members and friends and they love them, too!",1
Purchased this for my 3-year old.  It is perfect for her.  Holds enough clothes for several days and nights as well as her blanket and a couple toys.  Love the strap for parents to easily carry it.  Will be buying one for my son in a couple years.,1
"This chair works well for us - we like the fact that it sits right on our regular kitchen chair so it doesn't take up a huge amount of space, even though we do have the space for a highchair in our kitchen.  It is very sturdy and stable, with straps that both go under the chair and around the back to hold this tightly in place.  We previously bought the other Fisher Price space saver chair that doesn't have a cushion, but that one is being sent to Grandma and Grandpa's house.  We still like it, but our child didn't seem as comfortable in it or able to sit as long without the padding in the seat, so we bought this to replace it.  The Scatterbug design is cute and neutral enough for either a boy or girl.This chair is easy to clean as well.  The padding is easily removable to machine wash.  The tray is easy to clean, but doesn't easily fit in our dishwasher without being tipped and taking up lots of room (we have to mostly keep the bottom of the dishwasher empty to make this fit), so we mostly just hand wash it.",1
Cute frog potty. I wish that the pee pee cover was taller.  I have a very tall 2yr and they don't seem to cover very well.  Other then that it was a great price and I would buy again.,1
"My stroller did not have the velcro attachments, so I had to put them on, and was the only way to make it work. Other than that,  work fine.",1
"It works which is all a parent really needs, and for the price you really can't go wrong,  but the reviews about the noise is correct.  It will be pretty hard to sleep with that in the same room as us with the white noise constantly going.",0
"My seven month old loves this toy.  Each of the sections of the caterpillar do something different - some crinkle, some rattle, the nose has a musical tune that plays when you squeeze it.  They also are all different colors and textures, and are very stimulating for a baby.",1
wow i love my tiara photo frames very pleased with them they are so nice and glad i bought them,1
"I absolutely love this crib set, i spent forever researching and reviewing other peoples opinions about all different kind of crib sets, i was a bit hesitant at first but as soon as i got it in the mail and opened it up, i fell in love! great price for a 13 piece set! completely well worth the moneyUpdate: I ended up not using this long. It's more for looks. I ended up having to wash the blanket and now it looks real ""used"" I am now pregnant again and I won't be wasting my money on a crib bedding set. Babies don't need pillows or comforters. The only thing she uses is the sheet. It's cute when you first get it but the ""magic"" slowly fades away.",1
"I originally bought this to add color to our very white and drab wool collection.  I found it very difficult to find a trimmer wool cover that was both organic and with color, so this fit the bill nicely.  We've used it for about two weeks now, and I love that it is trim enough to fit under my 4.5 month olds clothing during the day, yet offers enough room in the crotch to really pack in a few doublers for a 12-hr night.  It is super soft to the touch, bulletproof on leaks (pee that is; we've had a few blow outs as the elastic isn't suction-tight around the legs as our other trimmer wool daytime cover), and dries faster than ANY of our other double layer wools.  Plus, I love that the dye is even safe!  However, I have found that it fits better on bigger babies, as the elastic is more snug around my 20 lbs 4.5 month old's legs than my 26 lbs 2.5year olds legs.  I have been using this non-stop day and night, except when washes are necessary!  I am starting to see signs of pulling along the snaps and am starting to wonder if stretching will be an issue.  All in all, very happy with my purchase and will definitely buy more if needed.",1
"We have the bugaboo chameleon, which we love, except the sun shade isn't long enough to shade our child's face most of the time, and if we pull the shade all the way down, she can't see. We tried getting her to wear a sun hat, but we all know how long kids keep hats on. We also tried hanging a light blanket over the edge and the wind just blew it off. I was so sick of flipping the sun shade back and forth on what were supposed to be leisurely strolls, that I went searching for an alternate. I put this sun shade on the minute it arrived and it worked like a charm! Easy to attach, adjustable, and SUPER light. The only negative is you can't fold it back when taking the child in and out, but it's easily bendable, so it's easy to just nudge it back with your shoulder. Plus, since it twist and folds in a snap, and it's so easy to take on and off, it's not really a huge negative in my mind. I can actually do long strolls without constantly having to check if the sun is blazing down on my child's face. Another plus is that it also fits on our light travel stroller, which is perfect for trips this summer. It has great side pockets for a light wallet, chap stick, keys or sunglasses. So great, because I don't have to go fishing around the stroller bag for small items anymore! It would also fit a cell phone, but because of reports about radiation and cell phones, I wouldn't suggest it. I keep my cell under the stroller in a bag and away from her brain. I find myself constantly asking why bugaboo doesn't just make their sun shade exactly like this one?!",1
"Bought this for my grandson when he graduated from his infant car seat to the next one.  He was only a few months old, as he is a big boy, and he had little control over his head.  He was always in the most uncomfortable position for his mom and grandma, bought this and it worked perfectly.  He now enjoys his many car rides, as do mom and grandma!",1
"When I saw these for $5.00 I assumed I'd be getting a cheap white elephant gift. I was pleasantly surprised. These little head massagers are fantastic. Everyone in the family loves them. They do not tangle up in you hair at all, nor do they poke you when you use them. They do come packaged as one, but it's quite simple to individually wrap them and give them as gifts. I am purchasing more and making them stocking stuffers for the adults in my family ... however the kids love the scalp massagers, too.",1
"If you are a person that moves a lot in bed, this pillow is huge, heavy and too high for my like, although it can be use in different positions.  I am hoping to get a better use of it when the baby comes.",0
"I bought one of these for my son when he was 3 months. He used this more than Sophie (the teething giraffe). I like it because he can learn to brush his teeth on his own and I don't have to worry about him falling and gramming it in his mouth because it's soft. I highly recommend this product to infants and toddlers. My son is now 18 months. We've lost it, so I am buying another one. Also if you know anything about SOPHIE the teething giraffe, then you know she's about $25.00, I would pay just as much for this tooth brush/teether.BUY THIS! YOU WON'T REGRET IT.",1
"This gate met and exceeded my expectations.  It is solid, well built and easy to install.  One feature that I was not aware of, is that the gate is spring loaded and always goes back to the closed position unless you open it to the 90 degree position. This feature is very handy as most times we want the gate to remain open and it does that.",1
"The birthday cake is cute, but a disappointment. I certainly don't think it was worth the pricetag. The photo album also is rather small and cheap.",0
"I bought this car seat from Costco and I must say it is disappointing.I feel this product is poorly made and poorly designed.The red handles on the seat adjustment falls off so easily.  I spent more time in looking for it than using it.The height adjustment metal stick works as really simple mechanics but it is very stiff to use;  Once I pulled it out by accident and realized how poorly it was made. Luckily I was able to put it back, but ever since then, these two sticks falls off periodically and become almost unusable.Every tweak-able spot on this car seat is stiff to use, I don't know it's safe or not, but I surly hated it.The only thing I liked is the cheek pad on the belt, it helps to prevent belt scratches baby's face. Everything else is disappointing.Do-Not-BuyIf I could find my receipt, I would have returned it.",0
"We got bought this for the top of deck stairs as a pool gate. It is attractive to the eye and works well. I am starting to see a little bit of rusting already, but honestly I can't expect that not to happen when it's outside. This is probably intended for inside anyway. It's nice looking and does the job.",1
"Honestly after the first week of bathing my baby, I figured out the temperature that he like to be bathed at just by touching the water. It's great for peace of mind if you're a first time parent but it's not a must have.it takes a while for the temp to show up on the screen and it's kinda hard to read.",0
"it is a nice chair and cleans up easily.  however, my baby's butt gets fairly red after sitting in it for only 15 minutes.  the orange foam can be a little softer?",0
This swing is wonderful! Very portable and great quality. Our son loves it! I definitely recommend this swing for any baby!,1
This product is amazing!  My daughter kicks her covers off at night & I worried about her being cold. This ended up being just what I was looking for.,1
"Baby doesn't like this feedback around her, she won't allow it. Great quality though. Very impressed with the quality of this item",0
We have used Halo sleep sacks since the day my son was born!  He is now 21months and still in it.  The satisfaction of always knowing that he has a blanket on him and he's not stuck under it etc is priceless.  The lightweight is perfect for the summer!,1
Cute bowls for a todder. They are a descent size and are easy to clean and don't stain. They also havent peeled and they have very cute drawings on them.,1
Some babies need a snug swaddle for optimal sleep even after 4 months of age. These large size swaddle-me are great. They are sturdy and the velcro works great.,1
"This roller shade is affordable and of good quality, but it would be more effective in our Saab station wagon if it were wider.  The sun always seems to find its way through the remaining gaps, right into my daughter's eyes, thus ""complete coverage"" is a bit misleading.",1
The gentle rattling makes this a wonderful cause and effect toy for newborns. They can go on wrists or ankles to encourage movement to create the sound!,1
"These are packaged nicely, and make a handsome gift. However, I was disappointed that they aren't hinged or well fitted. The lids just sit on top. It's fine for presentation, or keeping on a high shelf. But, if used as intended a little extra care is needed so you don't accidentally spill that first lock or tooth.I would pass on these for myself and look for a more 'limoge' type styled set.",0
"We received this item quickly and in perfect condition. We are very happy with this product.KidCo Center Gateway Child Safety Gate 5.5"""" Extension - White",1
It's light and easy. My wife loves the style and portability of it. It's nice...it's expensive but worth it. It's perfect for the city.  Smooth as the bigger strollers,1
"This heats bottles fast and has auto turnoff when it is down, but I still watch it to make sure doesnt over heat. would recommend",1
"I've never written a review before, that's how much I love this product! My 10 month old son has been teething and drooling for months. No exaggeration, I would change his bib about 10x a day...ugh! I was tired of washing bibs every other day and decided to look for some relief.I stumbled across these bibs and bought them. Like all the other reviews state, the packaging is adorable and the colors of the bibs are bright and whimsical.Now, 1 bib a day, is all my son needs. They are super absorbent and his shirts stay dry! If could improve upon them, I would add some type of wicking ability to keep the top layer dry, hint...hint...May Moo Moo, I'm sure NASA could help you out with that;) And maybe cut off an 1"" to an 1.5"" to the width and length of the bib. Both minor adjustments that take away nothing from their awesomeness.Other than that, I plan to buy and recommend these bibs to anyone who has a drooly little one.Again they're awesome!",1
It's a helpful tool for toddlers learning how and when to use the batheoom..The battery that came with it didn't last long and it's very hard to get into to change them out because the prices are so small. OVERALL I recommend it to mom's and dad's who's having potty training problems!,1
"This double sided bumper book keeps my 3 month old grand daughter happy for long stretches! She looks and coos and grins the whole time the zebra, mirror and flower are in her view. My daughter says the baby is already very interested in the colorful flip side with it's crinkly pop out surprises.It can be tied to the rails of the crib or placed in the play yard for lots of happy infant time. I believe it's my grand daughters favorite toy besides sucking on her own little fists! LOL!!",1
"My toddler likes her night owl companion. The only drawback to this for us is that it as a timer which turns it off after about 15-20 minutes. My toddler doesn't fall asleep that fast and she likes to keep her owl on until she falls asleep. This means that when it turns itself off, she has to get out of bed to turn it back on. That delays her falling asleep. I wish the automatic turn-off would either be longer (minimum 45 minutes) or that it didn't have an automatic turn-off at all.",1
I purchased this little doll as a stocking stuffer for my daughter for Christmas.  It's really cute and my daughter enjoys it.,1
"We have had this chair for almost a year and it's great. It looks pretty and it's easy to clean. You're suppose to Velcro (included) the infant insert to the chair, but we did not do it because I didn't want to mess up the wood on the chair and because the food crumbs would get stuck in the Velcro. It only takes a couple of minutes to clean the whole chair. You just remove the infant insert and then wipe both the chair and insert with a damp cloth and wash the plastic tray and you're done.",1
"My 12 week old has loved being swaddled since we brought him home, and I finally decided to get this Woombie with leggies because he sleeps alot in things that need to be harnessed. We just recieved it in the mail, it looks like its going to work great except the leggies part is WAY big. I mean it looks like it could fit 1 year + in the legs. So it has alot of extra material leftover. But for now, it seems like its going to work out pretty well, hopefully he will grow into it :)",1
"These are nice and useful in theory, but only if you don't have a toddler with grabby tendencies. Our toddler ripped them off within a week. The sticky tape that is provided with the corners isn't good enough to hold them in place, realistically, if you have kids with any amount of natural curiosity. We are going to try and find a better double-sided tape for these, but this purchase may just be a lost cause.",0
"We just received this crib today and it's beautiful! The assembly was pretty easy and  wasn't complicated at all. Once it's put together it just looks great. Perfect fit, color, size and look. You won't be disappointed with this purchase at all!",1
The product was shipped quickly and was easy to assemble.  My son loves it and the activity center keeps him entertained when he is not flying around the house.,1
"These well-made extensions are easy to install and make for a great play area for our child. When tightened, the free standing area is sturdy enough to stand against. Highly recommend.",1
Kids love it.  Only issue is that of all bath toys; cannot get the water fully out of the toy and I chose to replace them after some time so that I don't have mold and mildew issues.,1
"Out of all diapers Ive tried I recommend bum genius as the best.  Size will last till toddler age.  diaper cover fully covers bum area.  Inner lining stays relatively dry.  I especially like the two sizes of inserts.  One very small, thin insert for tiny babies and larger insert when needed.  The smaller insert can later be used to double up w/ larger insert for naps.",1
This pillow is like a rock as the other reviewer commented.  My son hates this pillow.  What a waste of money!,0
"My 11 month old LOVES this thing!  The water goes up a little high though so it gets him in the face, he doesn't like that so much.  Its certainly a favorite bath toy in our house!",1
Worked great.  I saw an improvement in his rash and teething.  Recommend them for all babies.  I even have one four my four year old.,1
"I love it! This pacifier thermometer is ideal for young infants, providing comfort to the child while letting you check baby's temperature. Quick and easy to understand, I suggest you to buy also probe covers to keep it clean.  One of the best tools, if you have kids around!",1
"We gave this to my 8 mth. old and I have to agree that it does go too fast and he had a hard time keeping up, thus he ended up falling.  He also can't change directions, so basically he goes until he runs into something.  Also, it does flip forward from time to time when he leans on it as well.  When he falls or it flips, he sometimes bumps his chin on the handle which is too rough for that reason--probably needs to be made of rubber.  Sometimes his feet bang against the legs of the walker as he's moving and causes him to fall. He does enjoy the balls and putting them in the basket.  The music is quite entertaining.  It is a durable product, but not as safe as I would have liked.  He hasn't used it yet to ride on, so I can't speak for that aspect.",0
As long as you follow the directions and keep these moist they work great. The issue is remembering to keep the pillow moist.  I don't always remember so we are having an issue with browning of the pillows even though the packaging says non-browning.  This could be my fault.  I don't have any problems with the wipes drying out so it is easy to forget to add water to moisten the pillow.  The pillows definitely do help with keeping the wipes fresh.  For all intents and purposes the wipe warmer should be crawling with mold and bacteria and that just isn't the case.,1
"I was very excited to buy this video baby monitor, as I always want to make sure that my child is doing alright- not just audio will do.  However, I've owned it for two months and the power button on the camera just stopped working.  It seems a but cheap in terms of that switch material, so if you're going to be very gentle on  the camera and never move it, this is just fine.  For the rest of us, I'd recommend getting  something sturdier.",0
"In the first couple of months of my son's life I stuck his pacifier back into his mouth every five seconds, all the while dreaming of a product that would save me from my futile struggle.  This is that product!  Wish I had it from the beginning.  Now, at seven months, he really doesn't need his Brody Bear, but he still likes to have it at school as his comfort item.",1
I loved the Diaper Deko and it did keep most of the ordors out. But as someone else wrote one of the doors broke and I am in the process of returning it to the store. It is less than 2 months old and my baby is only 9 weeks old; so I don't think it is the size of the diapers. Overall though my husband and I were pleased with it.,0
"If you have issues with burning or itching, this is the stuff for you! I wish I had it years ago!",1
"I can't really say too much on these bottles, they seem great but the lid pops off too easy like there's not enough space to twist it on and when I do get it secure enough my baby won't take them.",0
"It's a really neat riding toy.  It was definently overpriced for what you get though.  Just because it was just discontinued they are overpricing it on amazon, ebay, etc...  I would say you can get another riding toy just as good for half the price at wal-mart.  Nothing special to this horse, but it is nice looking, and has neat music that plays when the child rocks on it.  It's well made, sturdy, and easy to put together.  Overall it's a good product.",0
"I used it in my work chair where I set all day at a computer.  It enabled me to continue working, when I probably would have been home in bed.  I recommend it to anyone with back pain due to a compressed nerve to try it. However, when I retired all back pain went away due to me not sitting all day.",1
"We purchased the 2009 Zippy.  All I can say is that it was a complete disappointment.The wheels do not fold into the proper position and make storing and moving in a folded position difficult.The product does not latch in to place well and often requires extra care to get it latched in.The stroller is extremely difficult to push directionally if you only have one hand on the stroller.  If you have a dog and plan to take the dog for walks with the stroller, you will have an extremely difficult time.There is very little room for storage at the bottom and getting items in and out of the storage can be difficult.I would hardly consider this lightweight.",0
"Like the other reviewers stated - the color is totally not Right!  The actual shade is baby blue!  This is the same exact sheet that I had purchased for more $$ from One Step Ahead.Wanted to have a few extra on hand, becaue ever since I started using the Boa Soft sheet - my little guy sleeps so well at night and during naps!  Will probably use it during the summer too!  Since it gets so hot here, and we have the A/C on all summer - it will continue to be a soft, warm & comfortable place for my little guy!",1
This item is awesome because it can monitor three areas of you home if you use all three bases.  Our only complaint is that sometimes there is a lot of static.  After getting the baby to sleep the last thing you want is to be woke up by your baby monitor........GRRRRR.,0
I bought this crib for my new grandson. was a little challenge to put together. Overall very nice and sturdy. I would recommend to any one.,1
I have the Dr Browns wide neck bottles and was having a hard time finding something to wash them in.  This basket was perfect for all of the normal and odd shaped parts!,1
"This pacifier was just what I wanted to get for my 2 month old. A pacifier that was made of a soft pliable rubber. I felt that it was a little expensive but I had been looking for a pacifier like this since I gave birth to my first child in 2005 and since this would be my last child I bought it. When I received it I opened it and found a sticky film on the entire pacifier so I looked for the boiling direction and found them printed on the inside of the box. After ripping the box open I read and followed the boiling directions, let it dry and cool, then popped it in my sons mouth. I expected him to take right to it and some how give me a wink letting me know my money was well spent. Instead he kept screaming and spit it out. Over a course of a month I kept reintroducing this pacifier to no avail. He wanted the cheep one I had picked up somewhere along the way. Here is a link to the pacifier my sone LOVES and the only one he will useGerber First Essentials 2 Pack Soft Center Latex Pacifier, Colors May VaryI do not recommend that you spend this much money on any pacifier it was not worth it because he wont use it and since I had to rip the box open to read the directions I didn't think I would be able to return it for a credit with the store. Plus it had been used. A little.",0
"The bib clips are very convenient as they make any restaurant napkin into a bib.  My daughter will tell me that she needs to wear her ""teddy bear"" when I want to skip a step and just tuck it into her shirt.  They're nice to have, although they are a bit difficult to open to insert the cloth.",1
I saw this product at a baby event and it caught my eye with the cutest packaging and design ever!! I bought them for my friends and for my baby.  I saw my friend's baby just LOVE this cup right away and it's special feature of the weight at the bottom of the soft straw to let the baby take in the last sip of what's left.  The design is very cute and love the fact that it's BPA free and that it's made in USA.  This will be a staple gift for all my friends!,1
My twins were teething and would not chew on anything but these. They love the squeaker in them too. It has provided so much relief and entertainment for them that it is well worth the money for the toys.,1
"Yes people its that good.When I first bought it , I opened the battery cover to see if there was a seal or not, as some people claimed there wasn't.There was.Some people claimed that the seal wouldn't keep the water out and in a couple of weeks my kid would be swimming in Alkali soup so I applied some &#34; O ring grease &#34; on the seal and pressed down the cover firmly when tightening the screws so I would get a good seal.Now when I first introduced the toy to him he was alarmed and frightened , but I played with the toy to get his attention , he wasn't comfortable with it the first two baths but on the third he would only play with this toy.You will love it because your kid will love it.Go ahead you wont regret it.",1
"I got this bag to hold my cloth wipes.  I wanted something that I could hook on to the side of the changing table and that I could zip up, and this bag meets those criteria.  The bag feels well made and the zipper seems pretty sturdy.  I've washed it three or four times now and see no visible wear/tear.  I really love that the handle snaps - my other hanging bag has an elastic handle that will really only work over a door knob.I agree with other reviewers that the ""large"" size seems a little small.  Since I'm using it for wipes I never fill it up, but I sort of doubt their claim of how many diapers it could hold.  My Fuzzi Bunz brand bag can definitely hold more dipes, though it doesn't zip closed.****UPDATE MAY 2013*****This bag is holding up really well.  I've had no problems with workmanship or materials and it's still getting washed at least once a week.  I'm still very happy with this purchase!",1
"I loved the idea of this feeder better than others I had seen because it had a better locking mechanism and a cap... Both big pluses... I was very excited, we were going to a track meet and I was able to put half a banana in there, close the cap over it and toss it in our diaper bag. So simple. However, the edging of the mesh is not finished and therefore banana bits are now forever entrapped in it... I soaked it, I ran it through the dishwasher, I used a bottle brush... Still it has banana bits... So, it turned into a ""one time use"" object for this household. Disappointed.",0
"Loses signal constantly.  Whether you are in the same room as the monitor or across the house it loses signal.  No rhyme or reason to the apparent loss.  Returned it for the Motorola BM36, which works great.",0
"My hospital gave us a SleepSack swaddle and we never used it because my baby did NOT like to be swaddled! We used blankets without really worrying until she started rolling around in her sleep, then we purchased this so she could be safe while she slept.  It's wonderful and keeps her nice and warm!  It's surprisingly long for just being a medium, I'm pretty sure my 2 1/2 year old nephew could fit in it with no problems!  I wish the material would stay softer longer though, after 2 or 3 washes, it's just not as snuggly anymore.",1
Maybe I am doing something wrong but the sound goes out after about 5 seconds.  And we are only in the other room which is less than 15 feet away.,0
The process of adhering this product to your furniture is most frustrating! There are no directions included only a few diagrams which are not helpful.,0
"My daughter goes to town on these when a tooth starts coming in. BEST teether I've found. Additionally, I don't worry about her walking around with it b/c of the shield which will keep it from going in to her mouth too far in the event that she bumps herself.I didn't have this when she was younger and I wish she did. As a toddler, with molars coming in, it's proving to be the best soother there is.",1
Not the sturdiest of booster seats for the truck but once the kid is in it the booster doesn't really move. Our oldest (will be 4 in a couple weeks) says its comfy so we roll with it... for now. Not the best choice for a primary booster but if you need something that you can easily swap between cars or to a family member when they take the kids this is nice and light weight.FREE TIP: There is nothing really to secure it to the tether anchor so if you can keep the strap from your old car seat.,1
Fits snugly and easily on our toilet seat.  Looks nice.  My almost 3 year old can easily get it on and off the toilet herself.  We've had no problems with pee getting out of the toilet when she's seated.  Quality product.  Works for us much better than the build in seat on our toilet cover.,1
These corner cushions look perfect on my end and coffee tables.  I have received many compliments on them.  The blue tint is not distracting at all-in fact it lets people know that you have taken an extra step for their protection and against accidents.  The two sided tape has not been an issue for me since I do not have small children in the house.,1
"Our grandson was not an especially tiny baby, just shy of 8 lbs. at birth. But he still had a lot of room to grow into his infant car seat and it did not really support his neck and head in any way. I loved the way this little addition snuggled him right into his seat.One thing I would mention, check the warnings and instructions that come with your infant's car seat. Some of them don't want you to make additions like this.",1
I love Ju-Ju-Be products as they really do think of everything! The PaciPod is machine washable and has and anti-microbial lining to help keep icky germs away. I love that this PaciPod has elastic on both sides to hold the pacifiers snugly and prevent them from falling out. I would definitely recommend this to anyone! I just purchase a second one in FB to match my FB Be Light!,1
"The dinosaur print comes in a soft fleece-like material but no issues with leaking or moisture wicking around the front of it! I love Alva Diapers, and this was an amazing deal for such adorable diapers.",1
"I don't really purchase items like this online, however, when I saw this I thought it was adorable and the perfect neutral color. And I was right. It looks great in my 31 year old cradle that was bought for my son, the first grandchild, and is now going to start being used for the next generation.",1
The items was shipped and received on time with no damage.  This was for my four month old grandaughter. She enjoys them.,1
"I had another company's bundle bag. The zipper broke so I bought the Jolly Jumper Cuddle Bag.  I can't believe what a better product it is.  The material is better, the warmth is better and it comes with a Head Hugger.  I've washed it and never had trouble with the zipper or fabric.  I did some research because I wondered how it could be such a better product when the other company is everywhere.  It turns out that Jolly Jumper had been making the Cuddle Bag for over 14yrs.  No wonder they have it right.  I will be buying the Snuggle Bag for my baby when she's bigger and will only buy the Cuddle Bag from now on!!",1
"Keeps my interior looking good and grips the car seat, helping it stay in place. Overall, great buy and functional!",1
Works great.  Wish it had more discs to choose from for projected visuals. Does the trick with the music. Love the  voice activation feature.,1
"This is my 4th child and my 4th care seat .....so I thought I'd switch it up from my usual graco  snug ride  classic 35 only because this one claims to be a bit more light weight.......well it is,maybe a tiny bit lighter BUT.......... unlike most other graco car seats this one ONLY works with thing made specifically for CLICK CONNECT..........so taking it to the grocery store for instance is a pain because it DOES NOT FIT ONTO A SHOPPING CART!!!!!!!! So yeah it weighs less to carry into the store but then what?! If you put it into the shopping cart there's no room for groceries! Hmmmmm........so then you have three choices1.) buy the click connect stroller frame and take it inside with you while pulling the shopping cart behind you :/ 2.) wake your baby up and put him into a baby carrier attached to you or 3.) wait to shop til you have &#34;alone time&#34;......... On the upside tho..........it looks pretty :)",0
"I love this bottle brush for several reasons. First, the brittles are soft yet firm enough to properly scrub the bottles clean without scratching any printing off the bottle itself. Second, the handle and brush head is perfectly sized to get in and wash narrow and wide bottles effectively. Third, the brush itself last longer than most. I don't own a dishwasher and hand wash mulitple bottles and sippy cups daily and one brush will last me a good 3-4 months before I need to replace it. I found that other bottle brushes only lasted me 2 months before I needed to replace it.My only complaint is that the nipple brush is pretty useless. It just doesn't remove breast milk film off silicone nipples no matter how much soap and scrubbing you use. I purchase nipple brushes separately and therefore removed a star due to the added cost when this bottle brush is a bit costly to begin with. (I use the BRU brand of nipple brushes and they work even better, last longer, and are cheaper than OXO's own set of bottle accessory brushes they sell separately).Other than that, I really love this bottle brush and recommend it, especially if you first invest in the set that comes with it's own stand. I love that the stand allows the brush to be stored and dried separately and it's worth the investment. If you're looking for a good bottle brush in fun colors, I recommend purchasing this bottle brush!",1
Although this says it is for 6 month+ I would say it is more for 9+ months. The flow is very fast but this is a great sippy cup with the handles and the nipple!,1
I don't know why the heck I didn't purchase one of these sooner! This is a great accesory to use with a diaper sprayer. No more poo water splashing all over the bathroom!,1
"The Star Kids Travel Tray is great.  My 20 month old loves using this tray in the car to play with toys and to read books.  While she hasn't gotten the hang of the side pockets yet, the tray's edge keeps everything from falling so she is much happier.  I expect to be able to use it for years and years.  We are going on an international flight soon, and I plan on taking it along as it is much better than the trays they provide.",1
Absolutely love this seat protector. The entire back of the seat is protected and we can still get to the pocket on the seat. EASY to install. Great purchase!,1
These are so much fun to use. Really makes you feel like you are bonding with baby while in the womb.,1
My kids love it. Although it does take up quite a bit of floorspace and isn't the quickest/easiest to tuck away.,1
We have been very pleased with this booster seat. It is small and a great price. My son loves sitting at the dinner table with us and no longer having to sit in a highchair. Definitely a great purchase.,1
Shipping was fast. Easy to put together. Great color and fits in well in our new nursery. would deff. recommend this crib to other people.,1
"completely waterproof, fits crib perfectly, nice and firm.  Glad we bought this over others as it's proven to be the best quality snd value for money....",1
"Very nice seat - the onyx fabric is easy to clean. Easy to install. Easy to fit into the car - honda accord.The adjusting head rest is very nice too.Didn't give it 5 stars because it hasn't been completely """"tested"""" yet.",1
"I bought this as a Christmas present when our baby was about 6 months.  She had no idea how to use it until I showed her, but it's been one of her favorite toys since!She's using it more heavily now that she's finally starting to get her teeth in.  The little nubs also allow her to toss it around the room more easily, and she entertains herself by chasing it and throwing it over and over again.It does have a scent to it, but it isn't too strong and it smells clean.",1
"these diapers are the best so far! easy to take care of. I had ruined my first pack of Charlie banana by not following the washing and care instructions. never wash them with high heat or dry in high heat. I do not use the diaper soap, baking soda and vinegar works marvelous! Soaps leave a residue and gives my baby girl a rash. I have been using them for 6 months and they still feel soft and new. The dryer will deff take tje soft away. Dryer sheets will stop a good absorbency. the care of these diapers are very simple and should stay simple if you would like to keep your diapers for a long time. the initial purchase was kind of pricey. but we have yet to buy any other diapers. they have paid for themselves in 12 weeks. they are very cute and she has a color for every outfit. she is a very heavy wetter and we have not had any leaks yet. except for at night and we just put a plastic panties over the diaper. we bought the one size first. they grew with her quite well until we had bought a pack of large. if I had a chance to start over with a 10 pound baby I would just buy the large first. they are cheaper and they fit just like the one size. all of their diapers have adjustable snaps for different sizes on the legs and around the waist.",1
They are not hard and scratchy.  They also fit nicely.  They seem to hold up nicely to her thrashing and throwing them.,1
I have this item for only about 2 months and I dropped it only once.  It broke after I dropped it only once.  I do not recommend at all if you have toddlers or happen to be tired from being up with a newborn and are a little clumsier than usual.  I also called Motorola and they refused to fix it or give me a replacement unit even if I was going to pay for it.  Do not buy this!,0
"I have been using Rockin' Green Hard Rock detergent for about two years.  It worked very well for a while, but in the past 10 months or so, I have been battling ammonia stink that I cant seem to get rid of.  I tried stripping them and then used Funk Rock, but the stink is still there.  I'm beginning to wonder if I should try out a different detergent altogether.",0
My daughter just loved this and it became the first toy she actually wanted to play with as Infant. It's very soft and durable. Perfect size to throw in the diaper bag.,1
"The mattress fit the frame perfectly, is leak resistant and actually more comfortable than the mattress on our own bed. Perfect for our new addition.",1
the toy hammock is way bigger than what i thought it would be and holds a lot of stuffed animals.,1
"Awesome purchase. Works just as described on Amazon and looks just like the photos. I had not tried this particular model in store but knew it was a good brand so had lots of confidence. Super comfortable in both positions, facing front and facing back. BabyBjorn is a brand you can trust and we'll be buying loads more of their items!",1
"The materials are of good quality, the instructions to put it together are not the best.  I am very handy and this one annoyed me.  Also, the way they have you assemble it means that it is not very square when you're finished.  Ours had to be shimmed with cardboard on our wood floors.Not an issue with carpeted rooms, but still, it should be designed to square itself some as it is put together.  That was not even addressed in the instructions.",0
"I purchased this in the black color.  For some reason this site is not allowing me to submit this review in the black color, so it's showing this as a review for the silver bag.  Just as a side note, the silver bag was the same price as the black and blush. One day after this review was initially posted online under the silver color, the price increased from twenty-nine and ninety nine to over seventy dollars and now includes free shipping and free returns.I really wanted to love this bag. However, when I first opened the box, I had knew this bag would have to be returned. I contacted the seller via Amazon and they were very easy to work with and provided no hassle in providing a prompt return authorization. However, when I went to the post office, the clerk let me know that even at the cheapest shipping rate, it would cost almost half the price of the bag in order for me to return it to the vendor due to the location from which it was going to be shipped. So, with that in mind, I decided to keep the bag. I will probably pass it on to someone with 1 child or a first time mother, or just use it as a purse.Here is what I like about the bag:1. It is beautiful and fashionable. The silver hardware is also nice. It doesn't look like a diaper bag.2. The handles seem to be well made.3. It comes with stroller straps.4. The changing pad is not padded. For me this would not be an issue, as it only means that it could be tossed into the washer to be cleaned when needed. A padded changing pad would not be as easy to machine wash without getting torn up.Here are the deal breakers for me on this bag:1. The bottom part of the bag I received is not sturdy at all. It's very thin and flimsy. The faux leather is also very wrinkled, as if it were glued on improperly and left to dry that way. When you sit the bag down it just falls down all over the place.2. A reveiwer stated the dimensions of the bag and its pockets. The bag I received has different dimensions. For example, it was stated that the back zippered pocket was 8x10. The back zippered pocket on the bag I received is actually 3x5. In fact, all of the pockets are too small and not deep enough. This translates into all of my things falling out withing the bag.3. I could not fit hardly anything in the pockets. I tried to fit just 2 pampers cruisers size 6 diapers into the largest pocket. It did not work at all. I could not fit the adjustable strap inside any of the pockets. Nor could I fit a bottle into the insulated pocket. The insulated pocket is extremely small and narrow. My hand would not even fit inside , and I have small hands.4. The pocket on the changing pad is sewn on crooked and is also much to small. I could not fit diapers or travel wipes or anything else in this pocket.5. I am minimalist. I like to keep diaper bag packing simple. I could NOT fit a blanket, change of clothes for baby and 2 year old, juice box and small snack, diapers, and wipes into this bag. The bag I received was not as large as others described. I have 2 small ones and a 3rd baby on the way. There is absolutely no way I could fit what's needed in here. I tried and it didn't work.6. This bag is heavy when empty. When filled, it's even more heavy on the shoulder. I'm not willing to sacrifice my shoulder for style. I need to be able to lift, and move young children and a baby quickly without having to contend with a heavy shoulder bag.This bag is actually made under the brand name Tiddliwinks and sells for seventy nine dollars and up at T-a-r-g-e-t and B-a-b-i-e-s R Us. I purchased this bag from this vendor for twenty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents without free shipping and free returns being offered.  Kidsline is not affiliated with this brand name. I called the T-a-r-g-e-t headquarters to get the comapany contact information to find out more and they said that kidsline is not the name of the company that makes this. So, I then went to the kidsline website. The website does not mention any diaper bags at all, only room decor and such. So, I'm now wondering if this bag is not a knock off of the original brand. This might explain why my bag seemed a little different from other reviewers. Regardless, the bag is cute. However, one can find more functional bags on clearance at T-a-r-g-e-t. If you want cute then buy this. If you also crave funcionality then look elsewhere.",0
"Great bottle, very durable, but a little on the heavy side for a 16 month kid. Shows no signs of wear after being dropped / thrown several times. Very durable!",1
Awful....I would not invest or recommend this item...Very messy and fell apart.Very disappointed*(..Dont waste money with this product. Very  sad.,0
I received this as a gift for my baby shower and it is hands down the best gift I received. I have twins and use Dr Browns bottles. Everything stays in place as we usually go through bottles faster than we use the dishwasher. It's an amazing concept.,1
"I only wish I would have bought this sooner. My baby was about to move on to table foods when I bought this, but I had a kid that turned her nose up a chopped up items for a while, and would only eat purees. Weird, right? So I bought this so I could curtail the money spent on baby food and not have to drag out the food processor for every meal. We've also used this for guacamole and it's awesome. I would buy again!",1
These are the best!  They leak much less than any other cup we've tried.  We also really like that these cups can be completely (and easily) disassembled and reassembled for thorough washing.  I recently threw away every other kid cup in the house and replaced with these.  Another note- the other types (newer) of Munchkin cups leaked for us.  This particular model is the only one that our family has had luck with.  Buy them!  They're getting more difficult to find!,1
These are the best bibs you could ever order they protect the childs sleeves and laps!! If you like clean  kids then order these!,1
"This carrier is great! It's so easy to out on and get baby into. My son was always very comfortable in it. It was also comfortable for me too up until recently because he's heavy and it doesn't have lower back support. I'm getting a Beco Gemini now, but the Baby Bjorn is fantastic and I'll probably still use it for short amounts of time. I love that baby can look in or out and can be carried on your back.",1
"Baby hated this bottle. I hated it even more.I love the concept and was very excited to try this bottle. Each time I tried to use it - while screwing the lid super tight (which is, strangely enough, also the BOTTOM of the bottle - very weird) - it would STILL LEAK. Every time.That's just not OK when you are trying to feed a hungry, fussy baby and getting milk all over both of you, your clothes, the chair, the floor. Are you kidding me?A great concept and I wish they could have worked for us but I don't have time for leaking bottles. I just stuck with our Old Faithful, AVENT. Love them. Can't go wrong.If you need something that's very 'natural', I'd say give Tommee Tippee or Comotomo a try. Those are the ones I've heard great reviews on, without the leakage issue.",0
"Bought cause I know how the edge of tub can get slippery. My daughter loved it, I loved it. Great workmanship. Coloring is beautiful. Love the pouch for her jewelry on the side.  Great idea.",1
I purchased this for my daughter's stalking and she loved it!  It's cute and a great price!  I'm very happy with it!,1
"Bought the Froggy Potty for when my grandson is visiting.  His parents are potty training him with a potty seat that goes on the toilet which is going okay, but they were really jealous as he used his Froggy Potty successfully 3 times in one day for me!  High front worked very well; potty is very stable and easy to clean.  He really enjoyed using the potty...only problem was I had to slow him down so I could remove his pants and diaper before sitting down on it!",1
"Everytime my 2 year old falls asleep in his carseat his head tilts to the side in a very uncomfortable looking position. We were looking for some kind of a neck pillow and tried this to keep his head situated up. When attached to the seatbelts, this will keep his from rolling from side to side but his head still slides forward. He ends up with his chin on his chest. I tried to take it off of the belts and place it so it holds his chin up, and it didn't really offer much support for his head. It would probably work great with smaller children though!",0
"The first crib I received was missing pieces, instructions and was damaged. I contacted Amazon and they sent another one right away. It was perfect. My only complaint is I had to haul the old one to the UPS store in order to avoid additional shipping charges. That was a bummer! The look and quality of the crib was as expected on the second one shipped.  The black color is difficult to find.  It was a nice piece of furniture for a great value.",1
"I received the sailor suit in immaculate condition.  The buttons were a ship's wheel instead of the anchor, so no problem with the anchor being sewn on wrong.  The outfit was perfectly pressed.  I can't speak to size or fit as the baby is not due yet.  I bought the 6 to 12 month size rather than risk getting one that was too small.  Actually received the item in a shorter amount of time than predicted which worked out great as I had procrastinated and thought it wouldn't arrive in time for the shower.",1
"This is very cute. But be warned -- do not wash the fabric bag or you will NEVER get it on the frame again. Even in cold water with line drying, it shrunk dramatically. There's no way I can get it back on the frame and Carter's doesn't sell just the bag. So now I am stuck buying a whole new hamper.",0
I purchased the blanket for my grandson. I love the satin side but the fuzz from the fuzzy side has gotten on his pacifierand into his mouth.  Since then I won't let him sleep with it anymore. Maybe I'll try again when he no longer uses the pacifier.,0
"This gate was so easy to put together and install.  It worked great for an large opening between two rooms, but I did have to buy the extension.  I love that it is so easy to adjust.",1
"Bought for my first grandchild and she likes it so much I sent it home with her.  Easy to clean, very colorful with several acitivities.  Protects little ones from falls on wood or tile floors.",1
"Please thinking twice before purchasing this blind ""winder"" although it looks safer, it actually joins the 2 cords together reforming the loop in the operational cords.  Here is what happened to this child. [...]It is a different brand but the same thing.Do your research on window covering safety before buying this!",0
I have to say I was disappointed as the shield stem was too short and too opaque that you couldnt tell that the milk was coming out or not.  I have since switched to the one piece Medela system and it is much easier to see through and clean,0
I like that this carrier is like the Moby in how it can carry a baby. This carrier is easier to put on rather than having to wrap cloth around and around you.,1
"The box was damaged upon arrival. I was afraid after reading reviews if was going to be damaged. It did have a small chunk out of a few rails but we turned to the outside, so it won't come in contact with our baby. Our baby is not due for 9 more weeks so can't review on its ease of use etc. It wasn't difficult to put together. Overall it meets our needs to this point.",1
"Purchased for graduation. Rec'd in 2 days like requested. Pom's worked great, were a little small, but overall great. Thanks!",1
"For all of the reviews that said this car seat was a pain to work with, we thought we'd give it a try. After all, it is very highly rated for safety. Well, believe those reviews. I would rather have spent the extra money for an easier car seat to deal with.We should have known better when the fireman at the free car seat check-up/installation took one look and groaned.",0
"I bought this thinking it would make my life a little easier.  My toddler likes to turn the light in her bathroom on and off upon entering and leaving the room, which meant I would have to pick her up every time.  I know, I could do it for her, but I want her to learn how things work and that she can do things on her own.  Not only did this make my life easier, she loves showing grandparents and aunts how she can turn the light on and off.I read one review that said this was a real flimsy piece of plastic.  Maybe they made upgrades since that reviewer purchased theirs, but my experience is that I am very pleased with the construction of the piece.  The plastic arm is very rigid and it hangs (rests) about 3/4 of a inch away from the wall, so it doesn't scratch up the wall with all the up and down.  The screws with sleeves that it came with make for a solid attachment at the wall plate, and the action is smooth and consistent.It does glow in the dark if it has been exposed to light for a time, but the glowing properties don't last through the night.  The only thing I had to train my toddler to do was not to pull it away from the wall, but rather push up and pull down.",1
